large, flattened structures of moderate or even relatively low overdensity, so
there is no sharp distinction between the \lya forest and the ``Gunn-Peterson''
absorption produced by the smooth intergalactic medium. Our results demonstrate
that a \lya forest like that observed develops naturally in a hierarchical

hydrodynamics approach and individual time steps for gas particles give the

formation in a cosmological context. The code incorporates radiative cooling
for an optically thin, primordial composition gas in ionization equilibrium

prescription for star formation that gradually turns cold, dense,
Jeans-unstable gas into collisionless stars, returning supernova feedback
energy to the surrounding medium. In CDM simulations, some of the baryons that
fall into dark matter potential wells dissipate their acquired thermal energy
and condense into clumps with roughly galactic masses. The resulting galaxy
population is insensitive to assumptions about star formation; we obtain
similar baryonic mass functions and galaxy correlation functions from
simulations with star formation and from simulations without star formation in

red giants in fields at projected distances of 1.4-1.8 kpc from the Galactic
center are presented. There is a marked trend of kinematics with metallicity,
in the sense that the more metal-poor population has higher velocity dispersion
and lower rotation velocity than the metal-rich population. The K giants more
metal--poor than [Fe/H] = -1 have halo-like kinematics, with no significant
rotation and sigma = 120 km/s independent of Galactocentric distance. The
velocity dispersion of the giants with [Fe/H] > -1 decreases with increasing
Galactocentric distance, and this population is rotating with V = 0.9
km/s/degree. The present observations, together with the observed metallicity
gradient imply bulge formation through dissipational collapse. In such a
picture, low angular momentum gas lost from the formation of the halo was
deposited in the bulge. The bulge would then be younger than the halo.
Observations of the Galactic globular cluster system are consistent with this
picture, if we associate the metal-rich globular clusters within 3 kpc of the
Galactic center with the bulge rather than with the thick disk or halo. Data on
the RR Lyr in Baade's window are also consistent with this picture if these
stars are considered part of the inner halo rather than the bulge.

with Dirichlet boundary conditions (the problem of the quantum billiard) one
surprisingly faces enormous difficulties if the domain has a problematic
geometry such as various nonconvex shapes. We have tested several general
numerical methods in solving the quantum billiards. Following our previous
paper (Li and Robnik 1995) where we analyzed the Boundary Integral Method
(BIM), in the present paper we investigate systematically the so-called Plane
Wave Decomposition Method (PWDM) introduced and advocated by Heller (1984,
1991). In contradistinction to BIM we find that in PWDM the classical chaos is
definitely relevant for the numerical accuracy at fixed density of
discretization on the boundary $b$ ($b$ = number of numerical nodes on the
boundary within one de Broglie wavelength). This can be understood
qualitatively and is illustrated for three one-parameter families of billiards,
namely Robnik billiard, Bunimovich stadium and Sinai billiard. We present
evidence that it is not only the ergodicity which matters, but also the
Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov entropy. Although we have no quantitative
theory we believe that this phenomenon is one manifestation of quantum chaos.

quantum delocalized, the delocalization being essentially different in silicon
and in germanium. Oxygen in silicon lies at the bond center site in a highly
anharmonic potential well, whereas in germanium it is found to rotate almost
freely around the original Ge-Ge bond it breaks. This different delocalization
is the origin of the important differences in the low energy excitation
spectra: there is a clear decoupling in rotation and vibration excitations in
germanium, giving different energy scales (1 cm$^{-1}$ for the rotation, 200
cm$^{-1}$ for the $\nu_2$ mode), whereas both motions are non-trivially mixed
in silicon, in a common energy scale of around 30 cm$^{-1}$. The calculation of
the vibrational spectra of the defect reveals the existence of vibrational
modes (related to the $\nu_1$ mode) never been experimentally observed due to
their weak infrared activity. It is found that the combination of these modes
with the well established $\nu_3$ asymmetric stretching ones is the origin of
the experimentally well characterized modes at frequencies above the $\nu_3$

aggregation-evaporation, if the evaporation is mass conserving, \ie, the
monomers which evaporate remain in the system and continue to be reactive, the
competition between evaporation and aggregation leads to several asymptotic
outcomes. For weak evaporation, the kinetics is similar to that of aggregation
with no evaporation, while equilibrium is quickly reached in the opposite case.
At a critical evaporation rate, the cluster mass distribution decays as
$k^{-5/2}$, where $k$ is the mass, while the typical cluster mass grows with
time as $t^{2/3}$. In aggregation-condensation, we consider the process with a
growth rate for clusters of mass $k$, $L_k$, which is: (i) independent of $k$,
(ii) proportional to $k$, and (iii) proportional to $k^\mu$, with $0<\mu<1$. In
the first case, the mass distribution attains a conventional scaling form, but
with the typical cluster mass growing as $t\ln t$. When $L_k\propto k$, the
typical mass grows exponentially in time, while the mass distribution again
scales. In the intermediate case of $L_k\propto k^\mu$, scaling generally
applies, with the typical mass growing as $t^{1/(1-\mu)}$. We also give an
exact solution for the linear growth model, $L_k\propto k$, in one dimension.

The Josephson current is obtained for two geometries of experimental relevance:
a quantum wire and a ring. At zero temperature, the critical current is found
to decay algebraically with increasing distance $d$ between the junctions. The
decay is characterized by an exponent which depends on the strength of the
interaction. At finite temperatures $T$, lower than the superconducting
transition temperature $T_c$, there is a crossover from algebraic to
exponential decay of the critical current as a function of $d$, at a distance
of the order of $\hbar v_F/k_B T$. Moreover, the dependence of critical current
on temperature shows non-monotonic behavior. If the Luttinger liquid is
confined to a ring of circumference $L$, coupled capacitively to a gate voltage
and threaded by a magnetic flux, the Josephson current shows remarkable parity
effects under the variation of these parameters. For some values of the gate
voltage and applied flux, the ring acts as a $\pi$-junction. These features are
robust against thermal fluctuations up to temperatures on the order of $\hbar

effect. The amplitude and the phase of the time-dependent Josephson current are
affected by electron-electron interactions. Specifically, the amplitude shows
pronounced oscillations as a function of the bias voltage due to the difference

sector of the minimal Standard Model. We construct the effective potential for
the scalar doublet, by first taking into account the leading contributions of
the top quark loops. Minimizing this potential gives us a condition analogous
to the leading-Nc gap equation of the standard ${\bar t}t$-condensation model
(Top-mode standard model). This essentially nonperturbative condition leads to
a low ultraviolet cutoff $\L = O(1 TeV)$ in the case when the bare mass $\mu$
of the scalar doublet in the tree level potential satisfies $\mu^2 = -M^2_0
\leq 0$ and the scalar doublet there is selfinteracting ($\lambda > 0$). We
demand that the scalar selfinteraction behave perturbatively -- in the sense
that its 1-loop contributions influence the effective poten- tial distinctly
less than those of the Yukawa coupling of the heavy top quark. When we
subsequently include the 1-loop contributions of the scalar and the gauge
bosonic sectors in a perturbative manner, the results change numerically, but
the cutoff $\L$ remains $O(1 TeV)$. The resulting Higgs mass $M_H$ is then in
the range 150-250 GeV. Furthermore, the results of the paper survive even in
the case when the square of the bare mass $\mu^2$ is positive, as long as
$\mu^2 \leq O(\lambda v^2)$, where $\lambda/4!$ is the usual bare coupling
parameter of the quartic selfinteraction of the scalars and $v$ is the vacuum

expected to consist of nuclei surrounded by superfluid neutrons and a

crust of a neutron star. Using a modern meson--exchange potential in the
framework of a local--density approximation we calculate the neutronic specific
heat accounting for various shapes of the Coulomb lattice, from spherical to
non--spherical nuclear shapes. We find that a realistic nucleon--nucleon
potential leads to a significant increase in the neutronic specific heat with
respect to that obtained assuming a uniform neutron distribution. The increase

consequences for the thermal history of young neutron stars.

  figure obtainable from the author",,,"UnB-006","quant-ph",,"  In these continuation papers (VI and VII) we are interested in approach the
problem of spin from a classical point of view. In this first paper we will
show that the spin is neither basically relativistic nor quantum but reflects
just a simmetry property related to the Lie algebra to which it is associated.
The classical approach will be paraleled with the usual quantum one to stress
their formal similarities and epistemological differences. The important
problem of Einstein-Bose condensation for fermions will also be addressed.

spin eigenfunctions is obtained and solved. We show that all the properties
already derived using the Heisemberg matrix calculation and Pauli's matrices
are also obtained in the realm of these analytical functions. We also show that
Einstein-Bose condensation for fermions is expected. We then conclude this
series of two papers on the concept of classical spin.

relations. We present a short exposition of it and discuss how this calculus
can be used to discretize continuum models and to construct representations of
Lie algebras on a lattice. Related ideas appeared in recent publications and we
show that the examples treated there are special cases of umbral calculus. This
observation then suggests various generalizations of these examples. A special
umbral representation of the canonical commutation relations given in terms of
the position and momentum operator on a lattice is investigated in detail.
