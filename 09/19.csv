nearby OB runaway stars. The observations involved both searching images for
point sources of continuum emission and a time series analysis. Our mean flux
sensitivity to pulsars slower than 50 ms was 0.2 mJy. No new pulsars were found
in the survey. The size of the survey, combined with the high sensitivity of
the observations, sets a significant constraint on the probability, $f_p$, of a
runaway OB star having an observable pulsar companion. We find $f_p \le 6.5$\%
with 95\% confidence, if the general pulsar luminosity function is applicable
to OB star pulsar companions. If a pulsar beaming fraction of \onethird\ is
assumed, then we estimate that fewer than 20\% of runaway OB stars have neutron
star companions, unless pulsed radio emission is frequently obscured by the OB
stellar wind. Our result is consistent with the dynamical (or cluster) ejection
model for the formation of OB runaways. The supernova ejection model is not
ruled out, but is constrained by these observations to allow only a small
binary survival fraction, which may be accommodated if neutron stars acquire
significant natal kicks. According to Leonard, Hills and Dewey (1994), a 20\%
survival fraction corresponds to a 3-d kick velocity of 420 km s$^{-1}$. This
value is in close agreement with recent revisions of the pulsar velocity
distribution.

circumstellar outflows from oxygen-rich late-type stars, as a function of the
mass-loss rate and the terminal outflow velocity. For each mass-loss rate and
terminal outflow velocity considered, we computed self-consistently the gas
density, temperature, outflow velocity, and water abundance as a function of
distance from the star. We then used an escape probability method to solve for
the equilibrium level populations of 80 rotational states of water and thereby
obtained predictions for the luminosity of a large number of far-infrared
rotational transitions of water. In common with previous models, our model
predicts that water will be copiously produced in the warm circumstellar gas,
and that water rotational emission will dominate the radiative cooling.
However, our use of a realistic radiative cooling function for water leads to a
lower gas temperature than that predicted in previous models. Our predictions
for the far-infrared water line luminosities are consequently significantly
smaller than those obtained in previous studies. Observations to be carried out
by the Infrared Space Observatory will provide a crucial test of the models
presented here.

a custom broad--band filter set ($U_n G {\cal R}$) designed to isolate objects
having Lyman continuum breaks superposed on otherwise flat--spectrum

known galaxies producing optically thick QSO metal line absorption systems, but
are equally sensitive to more generally distributed objects at the redshifts of
interest. Together with previously published results of the survey, we have now
detected in two out of six cases objects with the expected properties of
star--forming galaxies at $z \simgt 3$ within 3~arcsec of the QSO sight lines;
the two candidate absorbers have similar luminosities, $M_B \simeq -22$

10~h^{-1}$~kpc. The average surface density of robust Lyman break objects is
$\sim 0.5$ galaxies per square arcminute to a magnitude limit ${\cal R} =
25.0$. A simple, ``no evolution'' model based on the properties of normal
galaxies at $z \simlt 1$ predicts a density of Lyman break objects only a few
times larger than observed. We conclude that there is a substantial population
of star--forming galaxies, of relatively normal luminosity, already in place at

Lyman-limit systems is found to be very efficient in reprocessing soft X-ray,
helium-ionizing photons into ultraviolet, hydrogen-ionizing ones. We
demonstrate that a significant fraction of the absorbed primary photons
(emitted, e.g., by quasar sources) will be reradiated by the photoionized gas
through \Lya line emission, two-photon continuum, and recombination continuum
radiation. In the light of new data and recent studies, we also reassess the
contribution of the QSOs observed in optical surveys to the UV extragalactic
background, and find that the stochastic reprocessing of quasar Lyman continuum
radiation by hydrogen and helium along the line of sight will significantly
affect the amplitude, spectral shape, and fluctuations properties of the
metagalactic flux. In a scenario in which QSOs are the primary source of
ionizing photons in the universe, the integrated \HI \Lya emission at $z=0$
from photoionized \Lya clouds and Lyman-limit systems is found to be at a level
of less than 5\% of current observational limits on the far-UV extragalactic

from an earlier quasar phase. Such galaxies also have an extensive hot gaseous
halo. Here we consider why the nuclei of elliptical galaxies are not luminous
sources due to the accretion of the hot gas by the central black hole, yet have
weak radio sources. In particular we suggest that accretion from the hot medium
has low radiative efficiency and forms a hot ion torus surrounding the black
hole. Synchrotron emission from the torus can account for at least part of the
weak radio sources commonly seen in otherwise normal elliptical galaxies. The
inner funnel of the ion torus can also begin the collimation of a narrow jet.
We speculate on the difference between jets from the nuclei of spiral and
elliptical galaxies and suggest that the extensive hot atmosphere seen in
ellipticals is essential for maintaining the collimation and provoking the
observed radio structures of radio galaxies. We also note that low radiative
efficiency, and not necessarity a large change in accretion rate, may be
responsible for the demise of quasars and may contribute to the hard X-ray
Background. Hot ion tori may be common in galactic nuclei.

with two species on an open chain could exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking
in some range of the parameters defining its dynamics. The symmetry breaking is
manifested by the existence of a phase in which the densities of the two
species are not equal. In order to provide a more rigorous basis to these
observations we consider the limit of the process when the rate at which
particles leave the system goes to zero. In this limit the process reduces to a
biased random walk in the positive quarter plane, with specific boundary
conditions. The stationary probability measure of the position of the walker in
the plane is shown to be concentrated around two symmetrically located points,
one on each axis, corresponding to the fact that the system is typically in one
of the two states of broken symmetry in the exclusion process. We compute the
average time for the walker to traverse the quarter plane from one axis to the
other, which corresponds to the average time separating two flips between
states of broken symmetry in the exclusion process. This time is shown to
diverge exponentially with the size of the chain.

in harmonic coordinates of the Minkowski space-time. For each value of the
coupling constant $a$, these solutions are characterized by a set of three
parameters, the physical mass $\mu_0$, the electric charge $Q_0$ and the scalar
field parameter $k$. We have found that the solutions for both gravitational
and electromagneticfields are not only affected by the scalar field, but also
the non-trivial coupling with matter constrains the scalar field itself. In
particular, we have found that the constant $k$ generically differs from $\pm
1/2$, falling into the interval $|k|\in [0, {1\over2}\sqrt{1+a^2} \hskip 2pt

field $\phi$ is totally decoupled from the matter. Our results differ from
those previously obtained in that the presence of arbitrary coupling constant
$a$ gives an opportunity to rule out the non-physica horizons. In one of the
special cases, the obtained solution corresponds to a charged dilatonic black
hole with only one horizon $\mu_+$ and hence for the Kaluza-Klein case. The
most remarkable property of this result is that the metric, the scalar
curvature, and both electromagnetic and scalar fields are all regular on this
