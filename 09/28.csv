primordial bodies left over from the planet formation process. The region up to
heliocentric distance $\sim 50 AU$ (a.k.a. the Kuiper Belt) may be the source
of the observed short period comets. In this region, the phase space structure
near orbital resonances with Neptune is of special interest for the long term
stability of orbits. There is reason to believe that a significant fraction
(perhaps most) of the Kuiper Belt objects reside preferentially in these
resonance locations. This paper describes the dynamics of small objects near
the major orbital resonances with Neptune. Estimates of the widths of stable
resonance zones as well as the properties of resonant orbits are obtained from
the circular, planar restricted three-body model. Although this model does not
contain the full complexity of the long term orbital dynamics of Kuiper Belt
objects subject to the full N-body perturbations of all the planets, it does
provide a baseline for the phase space structure and properties of resonant
orbits in the trans-Neptunian Solar system.

fundamentally different from the classic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). It had
recurrences, pulsations, and a soft spectral component unlike classic GRBs.
With the exception of the soft component reported from the Konus experiment,
the unusual characteristics of March 5th were detectable main peak differs
markedly from the published Konus spectrum. Rather than being dominated by a
soft component similar to that observed in the soft gamma repeaters (SGRs), the
ICE-PVO spectrum appears to be consistent with a classic GRB spectrum,
especially above 100 keV. We believe that, given the ICE-PVO spectral
observations, the March 5th transient would have been classified as a classic
GRB when it was discovered.
  The SGRs and GRBs could be consanguineous: high-velocity neutron stars
initially produce SGR events (and, occasionally a GRB like March 5th) and when
they are older and in the galactic corona, they go through a GRB phase. The
March 5th event demonstrates that high-velocity neutron stars at distances of
tens kpc are capable of producing events like classic GRBs.

  Astrophysical Journal","Astrophys.J.460:801,1996","10.1086/177011",,"astro-ph",,"  We present an extensive study of accretion onto neutron stars in which the
velocity of the neutron star and structure of the surrounding medium is such
that the Bondi-Hoyle accretion exceeds .001 Msun/y. For most cases,
hypercritical accretion due to rapid neutrino cooling allows the neutron star
to accrete above the Bondi-Hoyle rate as previously pointed out by Chevalier.
However, for a subset of simulations which corresponds to evolutionarily common
events, convection driven by neutrino heating can lead to explosions by a
mechanism similar to that found in core-collapse supernovae.
  Armed with the results from our calculations, we are in a position to predict
the fate of a range of rapid-infall neutron star accretors present in certain
low-mass X-ray binaries, common envelope systems, supernova fallbacks and
Thorne-Zytkow objects (TZOs). A majority of the common envelope systems that we
considered led to explosions expelling the envelope, halting the neutron star's
inward spiral, and allowing the formation of close binary systems. Smothered
neutron stars produced in collisions also lead to explosions, preventing them
from forming millisecond pulsars. For supernovae in which the fallback of
material towards the neutron star is large, we find that a black hole is formed
within a few seconds. Finally, we argue that the current set of TZO formation
scenarios is inadequate and leads instead to hypercritical accretion and black
hole formation. Moreover, it appears that many of the current TZ models have
structures ill-suited for modeling by mixing length convection. This has
prompted us to develop a simple test to determine the viability of this
approximation for a variety of convective systems.

in hot dark matter in the form of massive neutrinos. We consider such Cold+Hot
Dark Matter (CHDM) models with one, two or three massive neutrinos, with total
mass ~4.6eV. Neutrinos of such low mass cannot constitute halos of galaxies and
groups, but only of clusters of galaxies. The limit on the density of neutrinos
in the central parts of galaxy clusters is estimated from the phase space den-
sity constraints. The ratio of the neutrino density to that of CDM through the
cluster is found analytically. It appears that the density of neutrinos is
suppressed within the Abell radius. However, neutrinos contribute ~20% of the
mass density to the cluster halo.
  Our numerical simulations match analytical results. The simulations indicate
that the cluster halo dark matter density profile has the power-law slope ~-2.5
which is close to that in the model with cosmological constant. We also found
that in the CHDM models the velocity dispersion is almost constant across the
cluster. This is quite different from the model with cosmological constant or
the open model where the velocity dispersion falls in the cluster outskirts.
  We discuss X-ray emission and weak gravitational lensing by clusters in the
model. We input the found spherically symmetrical fit to the CHDM mass density
profile and the X-ray surface brightness for the cluster A2256 into simple
equation of hydrostatic equilibrium of the hot gas. X-ray temperature derived
this way departures from both the data and actual prediction of the model,
which give almost constant temperature. We found also that the problem of high
baryonic fraction in clusters is not resolved in the CHDM models.

this survey is to identify galaxies within 3.5' from the quasar sightline, to a
limiting r-band magnitude mr = 22.5. The data are then compared to the HST
homogeneous sample of Lyman-alpha-only absorbers in order to put constraints on
the nature of these absorbers, and in particular on their relation to galaxies.
The analysis of our sample combined with those of previous studies shows that:
1) the redshift agreements of the Ly-alpha absorber-galaxy associations cannot
be due to chance coincidence; 2) there is no clear anti-correlation between the
Ly-alpha rest-frame equivalent width and the impact parameter for the whole
sample. Our results suggest that most Ly-alpha absorbers are not gaseous clouds
that belong in a strict sense to galaxies, as is the case for MgII absorbers.
The fraction of associations to the total number of galaxies at impact
parameter < D as a function of D drops from 1 to 0.65 at D = 200 H50 kpc and
flattens at larger values of D (> 300 H50 kpc), which leads to Ly-alpha
galactic halos sizes about three times larger than the inner MgII halo region;
3) there is no correlation between the galaxy luminosity and the impact
parameter. This again suggests that a significant Ly-alpha clouds do not belong
to individual galaxies, but instead are distributed in the local large-scale
structure. 4) the HWHM=120 km/s of the relative velocity distribution of the
Ly-alpha absorber-galaxy associations is consistent with either galaxy rotation
velocities or the local velocity dispersion in large-scale structures.

histories of a closed quantum-mechanical system such as the universe. The
condition applies, for a pure initial state, to sets of homogeneous histories
that are chains of projections, generally branch-dependent. Strong decoherence
implies the consistency of probability sum rules but not every set of
consistent or even medium decoherent histories is strongly decoherent. Two
conditions characterize a strongly decoherent set of histories: (1) At any time
the operators that effectively commute with generalized records of history up
to that moment provide the pool from which -- with suitable adjustment for
elapsed time -- the chains of projections extending history to the future may
be drawn. (2) Under the adjustment process, generalized record operators acting
on the initial state of the universe are approximately unchanged. This
expresses the permanence of generalized records. The strong decoherence
conditions (1) and (2) guarantee what we call ``permanence of the past'' -- in
particular the continued decoherence of past alternatives as the chains of
projections are extended into the future. Strong decoherence is an idealization
capturing in a general way this and other aspects of realistic physical
mechanisms that destroy interference, as we illustrate in a simple model. We
discuss the connection between the reduced density matrices that have often
been used to characterize mechanisms of decoherence and the more general notion
of strong decoherence. The relation between strong decoherence and a measure of
classicality is briefly described.

$\lambda_{SW}$ is naturally expressed in Toda variables, and the N=2 Yang-Mills

developed in particle and nuclear physics for the study of phase transition,
the distribution of cooperators is studied as a function of the bin size

moments a scaling exponent is determined and is found to lie in the range where
phase transitions are known to take place in physical systems. It is therefore
inferred that when the payoff parameter is increased through the critical

defectors. The universality of the critical behaviour is thus extended to
include also this particular model of evolution dynamics.
