Dynamical systems with unfixed parameter, a set of dynamical models with
parameter changing continuously and the accumulation of this change might be
large is introduced and discussed. The boundary crises and the period-doubling
bifurcations are found suppressed and scaling properties for these phenomena
are exploited. Due to this suppression, the period-doubling bifurcations seem
no longer continuous. We further discuss the possible applications of these
models.

It is
obtained by identifying the diffusion operator of the disordered systems with
the Perron-Frobenius operator in the general case. This association enables us
to extend results obtained in the diffusive regime to general chaotic systems.
In particular, the two--point level density correlator and the structure factor
for general chaotic systems are calculated and characterized. The behavior of
the structure factor around the Heisenberg time is quantitatively described in
terms of short periodic orbits.

is calculated within the leading $\alpha_s\ln{Q^2\over\Lambda_{QCD}^2}$
approximation of QCD using the leading order parton densities within the
nucleon. Novel QCD features of the production of excited states and of the
restoration of flavor symmetry are analyzed. At the onset of the asymptotic
regime, our analysis finds an important role of quark Fermi motion within the
diffractively produced vector mesons, and we suggest to use this effect to
measure the high momentum tail of the wave function of the vector mesons. We
deduce a kinematical boundary for the region of applicability of the
decomposition of the hard amplitudes over powers of $Q^2$ and/or a limit on the
increase of the cross sections of hard processes at small $x$, and briefly
analyze its consequences. We also estimate the nuclear attenuation of the
diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons and compare with estimates of
the shadowing of the longitudinal structure function.

relations should aid in computing knot invariants. They probably have an
interpretation in terms of quasitriangular (quasi-)Hopf algebras. They could
also have a topological interpretation, and may serve as a concrete model for
related ideas of Degiovanni, Drinfeld, Grothendieck, Ihara, and others.
