assumption that it is undergoing non-radial gravity mode oscillations and that
the two principal periods given by Krisciunas et al. (1995) are correct. We
find that the two periods are manifestations of an $\ell=3, |m|=1$ spheroidal
mode and its toroidal corrections due to the rotation of the star. As far as we
know, this is the first detection of toroidal correction terms in a real star.
The two modes probably are the result of rotational splitting.
  Our analysis provides for the first time a physical explanation of certain
characteristics of the observed behavior of the star. The amplitude of the
radial part of the pulsation for $f_1 = 0.795$\,d$^{-1}$ is a factor of 4
larger than the one for $f_2 = 0.346$\,d$^{-1}$. Since the photometric
variability is determined mostly by temperature variations, which in turn are
determined by the radial part of the pulsation, the photometric variability is
dominated by the mode with frequency $f_1$. On the other hand, $f_2$ is the
more pronounced one in all three spectroscopic moment variations (including the
radial velocity), reflecting that the transverse displacement of $f_2$, and not
the one of $f_1$, dominates the velocity behavior.

in Hamiltonian form. The derivation begins with the first-order action,
treating the generalized connection coefficients as the canonical coordinates
and the densitised components of the inverse of the fundamental tensor as
conjugate momenta. The phase space of the symmetric sector is enlarged compared
to the conventional treatments of General Relativity (GR) by a canonical pair
that represents the metric density and its conjugate, removable by imposing
strongly an associated pair of second class constraints and introducing Dirac
brackets. The lapse and shift functions remain undetermined Lagrange
multipliers that enforce the diffeomorphism constraints in the standard form of
the NGT Hamiltonian. Thus the dimension of the physical constraint surface in
the symmetric sector is not enlarged over that of GR. In the antisymmetric
sector, all six components of the fundamental tensor contribute conjugate pairs
for the massive theory, and the absence of additional constraints gives six
configuration space degrees of freedom per spacetime point in the antisymmetric
sector. For the original NGT action (or, equivalently, Einstein's Unified Field
Theory), the U(1) invariance of the action is shown to remove one of these
antisymmetric sector conjugate pairs through an additional first class
constraint, leaving five degrees of freedom. The restriction of the dynamics to
GR configurations is considered, as well as the form of the surface terms that
a rise from the variation of the Hamiltonian. In the resulting Hamiltonian
system for the massive theory, singular behavior is found in the relations that
determine some of the Lagrange multipliers near GR and certain NGT spacetimes.

is discussed. The connection is two-fold: First, as already known, the proper
time equation is the product of the Zamolodchikov metric and the
renormalization group beta function. Second, the condition that the two-point
function is the Zamolodchikov metric, implies the proper time equation. We
study the massless vector of the open string in detail. In the exactly
calculable case of a uniform electromgnetic field strength we recover the
Born-Infeld equation. We describe the systematics of the perturbative
evaluation of the gauge invariant proper time equation for the massless vector
field. The method is valid for non-uniform fields and gives results that are
exact to all orders in derivatives. As a non trivial check, we show that in the
limit of uniform fields it reproduces the lowest order Born-Infeld equation.

examined using three recent dynamical models and are compared to the general
features of such observables deduced earlier by Fasano, Tabakin and Saghai.
These general features, such as the energy dependence of spin observables and
the location of nodes in their angle dependence, are realized. Several
instructive surprises, which occur in this comparison to the conjectures of
Fasano et al., are then discussed. The sensitivity of spin observables to
isobar and {\it t-}channel dynamics is analyzed and suggestions for selecting
experiments which provide important dynamical information are presented.
