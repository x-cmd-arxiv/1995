bright nearby galaxy which has been resolved, an Abell cluster which is
revealed to have two (probably merging) components, and groups and clusters of

in the standard values of the helium-core mass at the tip of the red giant
branch, $\Mc$, from properties of the color-magnitude diagrams of Galactic
globular clusters is employed. In the present study, we revise and update
Raffelt's database, including also constraints from RR Lyrae pulsation, and
find that a small increase, by $\Delta\Mc \approx 0.01\pm 0.015 \Msun$, cannot
be ruled out with the present data and evolutionary models. Our new upper
limits on $\Delta\Mc$ are less restrictive than those previously obtained by
Raffelt, as are the corresponding constraints on novel astroparticle phenomena
which may affect the evolution of low-mass red giants. Within the estimated
uncertainties, however, the standard values of $\Mc$ may also be acceptable.
Raffelt's method does not rule out a low envelope helium abundance in globular
cluster giants, though again the standard values are compatible with the
available constraints. The influence of a non-solar ratio for the
$\alpha$-capture elements upon these results is also investigated. In addition,
we review several aspects of the input physics employed in red giant stellar
evolutionary calculations, with the purpose of evaluating possible sources of
uncertainty in the value of the helium-core mass at the helium flash that is
obtained from evolutionary computations, such as: heat conduction by electrons
in the degenerate core; Coulomb effects upon the Equation of State;
triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates and screening factors; neutrino emission rates,
both standard and enhanced by a possible non-zero magnetic moment; stellar
rotation; microscopic element diffusion; and energy losses by axions and Weakly

(Chaboyer \ea 1995) have been combined with a variety of relations for the
absolute magnitude of RR Lyr stars (\mvrr) to calibrate age as a function of
the difference in magnitude between the main sequence turn-off and the
horizontal branch (\dv). A best estimate for the calibration of \mvrr is
derived from a survey of the current literature: $\mvrr = 0.20 \feh + 0.98$.
This estimate, together with other calibrations (with slopes ranging from 0.15
to 0.30) has been used to derive \dv ages for 43 Galactic globular clusters.
Independent of the choice of \mvrr, there is no strong evidence for an
age-Galacto\-centric distance relationship among the 43 globular clusters.
However, an age-metallicity relation exists, with the metal-poor clusters being
the oldest. A study of the age distribution reveals that an age range of 5 Gyr
exists among the bulk of the globular clusters. In addition, about 10\% of the
sample are substantially younger, and including them in the analysis increases
the age range to 9 Gyr. Once again, these statements are independent of the
\mvrr ~relation. Evidence for age being the second parameter governing
horizontal branch morphology is found by comparing the average \dv ~age of the
second parameter clusters to the normal clusters. The second parameter clusters
are found to be on average 2 - 3 Gyr younger than the other clusters, which is
consistent with age being the second parameter. These results suggest that
globular clusters were formed over an extended period of time, with
progressively more metal-rich globular clusters ($\feh \ga -1.7$) being formed
at later times.

systematic variational optimization. The same projection allows obtaining the
band structure and the Hamiltonian matrix elements in the previously optimized
atomic basis. The spilling is shown to correlate with the mean square error in
the energy bands, indicating that the basis optimization via spilling
minimization is qualitatively equivalent to the energy-minimization scheme, but
involves a much smaller computational effort. The spilling minimization also
allows the optimization of bases for uses different than total-energy
calculations, like the description of the band gap in semiconductors. The
method is applied to the characterization of finite-range pseudo-atomic

range of interacions. A simple scheme is proposed to expand the basis without
increasing the range. It is found that a double-$z$ basis substantially
improves the basis performance on diamond, whereas $d$-polarization is required
for Si and Al for similar results. Finally, the projection allows the chemical

directly the strong-coupling expansion coefficients of the anharmonic
oscillator. The convergence is exponentially fast with superimposed
oscillations, as recently observed empirically by the authors. In this note,
the observed behavior is explained and used to determine accurately the
magnitude and phase of the leading Bender-Wu singularity which is responsible
for the finite convergence radius in the complex coupling constant plane.
