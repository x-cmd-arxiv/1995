the failure to the occurrence of (in Nagata's terminology) uniform abnormal

completely determining the modules in a minimal free resolution of $I^{(m)}$

Although the code (Piecewise Parabolic Method) is purely Newtonian, we do
include the emission of gravitational waves and their backreaction on the
hydrodynamic flow. The properties of neutron star matter are described by the
physical equation of state of Lattimer \& Swesty (1991). Energy loss by all
types of neutrinos and changes of the electron fraction due to the emission of
electron neutrinos and antineutrinos are taken into account by an elaborate
``neutrino leakage scheme''. We simulate the coalescence of two identical, cool
neutron stars with a baryonic mass of $\approx\!1.6\,M_\odot$ and a radius of
$\approx\!15$~km and with an initial center-to-center distance of 42~km. The
initial distributions of density and electron concentration are given from a
model of a cold neutron star in hydrostatic equilibrium (central temperature
about $8\,{\rm MeV}$). We investigate three cases which differ by the initial
velocity distribution in the neutron stars, representing different cases of the
neutron star spins relative to the direction of the orbital angular momentum
vector. Within about 1~ms the neutron stars merge into a rapidly spinning
($P_{\rm spin}\approx 1$~ms), high-density body ($\rho\approx
10^{14}$~g/cm$^3$) with a surrounding thick disk of material with densities
$\rho\approx 10^{10}-10^{12}$~g/cm$^3$ and orbital velocities of~0.3--0.5~c. In
this work we evaluate the models in detail with respect to the gravitational
wave emission using the quadrupole approximation. In a forthcoming paper we
will concentrate on the neutrino emission and implications for gamma-ray
bursters. A maximum luminosity in excess of $10^{55}$~erg/s is reached for
about 1~ms.

the Sun contains a factor of five to ten more metal-poor stars, $-1 \simlt {\rm

larger scale Galactic structure. The metallicity distribution of complete
samples of long-lived stars has long been recognised as providing unique
constraints on the early stages of chemical evolution of the Galaxy, so that
one would like to resolve this anomaly. We present a new derivation of the
local G-dwarf metallicity distribution, based on the Third Gliese catalog
combined with Olsen's (1983) Str\""omgren photometry. Kinematic data for these
same stars, as well as for a high-precision sample studied by Edvardsson {\sl
et al.} (1993), provide clear evidence that the abundance distribution below
[Fe/H]$\sim -0.4$ contains two over-lapping distributions, the thick disk and
the thin disk. We achieve a reliable deconvolution of the relative numbers in
each population by comparing the local metallicity distribution with a recent
determination (Gilmore, Wyse \& Jones 1995) of the metallicity distribution of
F/G stars {\sl in situ} some 1500pc from the Sun. The gravitational sieve of
the Galactic potential acts on this second sample to segregate the low velocity
dispersion, thin-disk, component of the local sample, leaving predominantly the
second, higher velocity dispersion component. The combination of these two
datasets allows us to determine the source of the local paradox: there is a
substantial tail of the thin disk (defined kinematically) metallicity
distribution, which extends below ${\rm [Fe/H] \approx -0.4}$dex. This is a
robust conclusion, being consistent with the sum of star count, stellar spatial

recognized. I give explicit expressions for the pixel noise induced by a
time-variable PSF, by photometric and geometric misalignment, and by discrete
pixelization, and I show that these can all be reduced below the photon noise.
Pixel lensing can be divided into two regimes. In the ``semi-classical''
regime, it is similar to classical lensing in that it measures the time scale
of individual events. In the ``spike'' regime, it measures the total optical
depth but not individual time scales. I present simple expressions for the
boundary between the two regimes and for the event rate in the latter one.
These expressions can be used to quickly classify all potential pixel lensing
experiments. Pixel lensing can measure the luminosity function as well as the
mass function of stars in target galaxies to a distance of a few Mpc. Future
space-based pixel lensing could be $\sim 5$ times more effective in the
infrared than in the optical, depending on developments in detector technology.
Pixel techniques can also be applied to non-pixel-lensing problems including
the search for unresolved variable stars and follow up observations of lensing
events found in classical lensing searches. To benefit fully from pixel-lensing
techniques, follow-up observations should have resolutions of at least 5 pixels
per FWHM.

described by a replica symmetry broken solution confined to the mode
$\omega=0$. For classical systems we compute the correlation function of
relative displacements. In $d=2+1$, in the absence of dislocations, the GVM
allows to describes the Bose glass phase. Along the columns the displacements
saturate at a length $l_{\perp}$ indicating flux-line localization.
Perpendicularly to the columns long range order is destroyed. We find divergent
tilt modulus $c_{44}=\infty$ and a $x \sim \tau^{1/2}$ scaling. Quantum systems
are studied using the analytic continuation from imaginary to real time $\tau
\to i t$. We compute the conductivity and find that it behaves at small
frequency as $\sigma(\omega) \approx \omega^2$ in all dimensions ($d < 4$) for
which disorder is relevant. We compute the quantum localization length $\xi$.
In $d=1$, where the model also describes interacting fermions in a static
random potential, we find a delocalization transition and obtain analytically
both the low and high frequency behavior of the conductivity for any value of
the interaction. We show that the marginality condition appears as the
condition to obtain the correct physical behavior. Agreement with
renormalization group results is found whenever it can be compared.

\exp -[\case{1}{2} (p-A)^2 + V]t \left| y \right\rangle$, $(p=-i\partial)$ in
powers of $t$ can be made in a number of ways. For $x=y$ (the case of interest
when doing one-loop calculations) numerous approaches have been employed to
determine this expansion to very high order; when $x \neq y$ (relevant for
doing calculations beyond one-loop) there appear to be but two examples of
performing the DeWitt expansion. In this paper we compute the off-diagonal
elements of the DeWitt expansion coefficients using the Fock-Schwinger gauge.
Our technique is based on representing $M_{xy}$ by a quantum mechanical path
integral. We also generalize our method to the case of curved space, allowing
us to determine the DeWitt expansion of $\tilde M_{xy} = \langle x| \exp
\case{1}{2} [\case{1}{\sqrt {g}} (\partial_\mu - i
A_\mu)g^{\mu\nu}{\sqrt{g}}(\partial_\nu - i A_\nu) ] t| y \rangle$ by use of
normal coordinates. By comparison with results for the DeWitt expansion of this
matrix element obtained by the iterative solution of the diffusion equation,
the relative merit of different approaches to the representation of $\tilde
M_{xy}$ as a quantum mechanical path integral can be assessed. Furthermore, the
exact dependence of $\tilde M_{xy}$ on some geometric scalars can be
determined. In two appendices, we discuss boundary effects in the
one-dimensional quantum mechanical path integral, and the curved space
generalization of the Fock-Schwinger gauge.

properties, in higher derivative gravitational theories is presented. The
complete non-linear sigma model for these degrees of freedom is exhibited using
the method of auxiliary fields. As a by-product we present a consistent
non-linear coupling of a spin-2 tensor to gravitation. It is shown that
non-vanishing $(C_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta})^{2}$ terms arise in $N=1$, $D=4$
superstring Lagrangians due to one-loop radiative corrections with light field
internal lines. We discuss the general form of quadratic $(1,1)$ supergravity
in two dimensions, and show that this theory is equivalent to two scalar
supermultiplets coupled to the usual Einstein supergravity. It is demonstrated
that the theory possesses stable vacua with vanishing cosmological constant
which spontaneously break supersymmetry.
