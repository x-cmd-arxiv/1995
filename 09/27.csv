minimal, they may prove useful as independent standards in identifying error

an outer shock. However, contrary to previous claims, no such steepening was

radiation at early epochs. We assess the validity of the stellar
photoionization hypothesis. Based on recent computations of metal yields and
O-star Lyman continuum (LyC) fluxes, we find that 0.2\% of the rest-mass energy
of the metals produced is radiated as LyC. By modeling the transfer of ionizing
radiation through the IGM and the rate of chemical enrichment, we demonstrate
that the background intensity of photons at 1 Ryd that accompanies the
production of metals in the \Lya forest clouds may be significant, approaching
$0.5\times 10^{-21}\uvunits$ at $z\approx 3$ if the LyC escape fraction is
$\gta 0.25$. Together with quasars, massive stars could then, in principle,
provide the hydrogen and helium LyC photons required to ionize the universe at
high redshifts. We propose that observations of the \HeII Gunn-Peterson effect
and of the metal ionization states of the \Lya forest and Lyman-limit absorbers

photoionization model fails if a large fraction of the UV radiation emitted
from stars cannot escape into the IGM, as suggested by the recent {\it Hopkins

(i.e. solar and higher Z). Dust provides a simple explanation for the
observational absence of pure Balmer-line spectra that are expected on
theoretical grounds for dust-free, chemically enriched nebulae. Grains may also
play a role in enhancements of forbidden-line emission observed in HII regions
in the enriched nuclei of normal galaxies. In most cases, depletion introduces
the strongest perturbations to the optical spectrum. Selective absorption of
the ionizing continuum as well as heating by grain photoelectrons are important
in some instances, however, and grain heating can be particularly important for
enhancing emission in high-ionization lines. Allowing for depletion, the
presence of dust is unlikely to introduce large errors in global metallicity
indicators, although uncertainties in depletion factors coupled with the
sensitivity of infrared cooling to electron density will make accurate
calibrations difficult at high Z. The present calculations establish further
that previous relative abundance analyses that fail to take into account dust
effects in a self-consistent way (grain heating as well as depletion) may
overestimate temperature gradients in high-Z nebulae, resulting in errors in

$\sim 6\times 10^{30} ~{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, despite a relatively high mass

of the accretion energy in such flows is stored within the gas and advected
radially inward. The temperature is therefore very high, and much of the
radiation comes out in hard X-rays and $\gamma$-rays. We have constructed an
advection-dominated accretion flow model for the Galactic Center source
Sagittarius A$^*$. The model consists of a $7\times10^5M_\odot$ black hole
accreting at $\dot M=1.2\times10^{-5}\alpha\, M_\odot{\rm yr^{-1}}$, where
$\alpha$ is the usual viscosity parameter. The model spectrum fits the
observations from radio to $\gamma$-rays quite well and explains the unusually
low luminosity of the source. Since the model explicitly makes use of a horizon
at the inner edge to swallow the advected energy, the success of the model
strongly suggests that the central object in Sgr A$^*$ is a black hole. We
further show that, if $\alpha$ is not much smaller than unity, then
advection-dominated models can be applied even to higher luminosity black
holes. The existence of Low and High States in black hole X-ray binaries, and
the abrupt transition between the two states, find a natural explanation. The
models also explain the close similarity in the hard X-ray/$\gamma$-ray spectra
of black hole X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.

Einstein-Bohr like discussions have to be re-opened. For instance one can ask
what happens to the quantum state of a black hole when the wave function of a
single ingoing particle is replaced by an other one that is orthogonal to the
first, while keeping the total energy and momentum unaffected. Observers at
$t\rightarrow\infty$ will not notice any difference, or so it seems in certain
calculational schemes.
  If one argues that this cannot be correct for the complete theory because a
black hole should behave in accordance with conventional quantum mechanics,
implying a unitary evolution, one is forced to believe that local quantum field
theory near the black hole horizon is very different from what had hitherto
been accepted. This would give us very valuable information concerning physics
in the Planck length region, notably a mathematical structure very close to
that of super string theory, but it does lead to conceptual difficulties.
  An approach that is somewhat related to this is to suspect a breakdown of
General Relativity for quantum mechanical systems. It is to some extent
unavoidable that Hilbert space is not invariant under general coordinate
transformations because such transformations add and remove some states.
Finally the cosmological constant problem also suggests that flat space-time
has some special significance in a quantum theory. We suggest that a new

spectrum resulting from exact diagonalization of the collective Hamiltonian is
discussed. The prediction of static properties such as the baryon magnetic
moments and the Cabibbo matrix elements for semi--leptonic hyperon decays are
explored with regard to the influence of flavor symmetry breaking. In
particular, the role of strange degrees of freedom in the nucleon is
investigated for both the vector and axial--vector current matrix elements. The
latter are discussed extensively within in the context of the {\it proton spin

is examined and observed to cause significant deviations from flavor covariant
predictions on the baryon magnetic moments. Short range effects are
incorporated by a chiral invariant inclusion of vector meson fields. These
extensions are necessary to properly describe the singlet axial--vector current
and the neutron proton mass difference. The effects of the vector meson
excitations on baryon properties are also considered. The bound state
description of hyperons and its generalization to baryons containing a heavy

to answer the ``three-space problem'' for strictly convex renorming: there
exists a Banach space $X$ with a closed subspace $Y$ such that both $Y$ and the
quotient $X/Y$ admit strictly convex norms, while $X$ does not. We also solve a
problem about the property of mid-point locally uniform convexity (MLUR),
showing that this does not imply LUR renormability.

methods, I discuss results and insights obtained from a number of applications.
These include the ground state and thermal properties of {\it pf}-shell nuclei,
the thermal and rotational behavior of rare-earth and $\gamma$-soft nuclei, and
the calculation of double beta-decay matrix elements. Prospects for further

Technical Report No.9501","patt-sol nlin.PS",,"  We consider the symmetry-breaking steady state bifurcation of a
spatially-uniform equilibrium solution of E(2)-equivariant PDEs. We restrict
the space of solutions to those that are doubly-periodic with respect to a
square or hexagonal lattice, and consider the bifurcation problem restricted to
a finite-dimensional center manifold. For the square lattice we assume that the
kernel of the linear operator, at the bifurcation point, consists of 4 complex
Fourier modes, with wave vectors K_1=(a,b), K_2=(-b,a), K_3=(b,a), and
K_4=(-a,b), where a>b>0 are integers. For the hexagonal lattice, we assume that
the kernel of the linear operator consists of 6 complex Fourier modes, also
parameterized by an integer pair (a,b). We derive normal forms for the
bifurcation problems, which we use to compute the linear, orbital stability of
those solution branches guaranteed to exist by the equivariant branching lemma.
These solutions consist of rolls, squares, hexagons, a countable set of rhombs,
and a countable set of planforms that are superpositions of all of the Fourier
modes in the kernel. Since rolls and squares (hexagons) are common to all of
the bifurcation problems posed on square (hexagonal) lattices, this framework
can be used to determine their stability relative to a countable set of
perturbations by varying a and b. For the hexagonal lattice, we analyze the
degenerate bifurcation problem obtained by setting the coefficient of the
quadratic term to zero. The unfolding of the degenerate bifurcation problem
reveals a new class of secondary bifurcations on the hexagons and rhombs
solution branches.

quantum state diffusion theory, many systems localize to wave packets in the
neighborhood of phase space points. This is due to decoherence from the
interaction with the environment, and makes the quasiclassical limit of such
systems both more realistic and simpler in many respects than the more familiar
quasiclassical limit for closed systems. A linearized version of this theory
leads to the correct classical dynamics in the macroscopic limit, even for
nonlinear and chaotic systems. We apply the theory to the forced, damped
Duffing oscillator, comparing the numerical results of the full and linearized
equations, and argue that this can be used to make explicit calculations in the
decoherent histories formalism of quantum mechanics.

We study the
so-called quantum Zeno effect, that arises from the quadratic short-time
behavior, and the analytic properties of the ``survival"" amplitude. It is shown
that the exponential behavior is due to the presence of a simple pole in the
second Riemannian sheet, while the contribution of the branch point yields a
power behavior for the amplitude. The exponential decay form is cancelled at
short times and dominated at very long times by the branch-point contributions,
which give a Gaussian behavior for the former and a power behavior for the
latter. In order to realize the exponential law in quantum theory, it is
essential to take into account a certain kind of macroscopic nature of the
total system. Some attempts at extracting the exponential decay law from
quantum theory, aiming at the master equation, are briefly reviewed, including
van Hove's pioneering work and his well-known ``$\lambda^2T$"" limit. We clarify
these general arguments by introducing and studying a solvable dynamical model.
Some implications for the quantum measurement problem are also discussed, in
particular in connection with dissipation.
