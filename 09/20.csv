high-redshift radio galaxy 3C~256 ($z=1.82$). A spatially integrated ($7.8''$
diameter aperture) measurement of the degree of polarization of the $V-$band
(rest frame 0.19 $\mu$m) emission yields a value of 16.4\% ($\pm 2.2$\%) with a
position angle of $42{}\rlap{\rm .}^\circ 4$ ($\pm 3{}\rlap{\rm .}^\circ 9$),
orthogonal to the position angle on the sky of the major axis of the extended
emission. The peak emission measured with a $3.6''$ diameter circular aperture
is 11.7\% ($\pm 1.5$\%) polarized with a position angle of $42{}\rlap{\rm
.}^\circ 4$ ($\pm 3{}\rlap{\rm .}^\circ 6$). An image of the polarized flux is
presented, clearly displaying that the polarized flux is extended and present
over the entire extent of the object. While it has been suggested that the UV
continuum of 3C~256 might be due to star formation (Elston 1988) or a
protogalaxy (Eisenhardt \& Dickinson 1993) based on its extremely blue spectral
energy distribution and similar morphology at UV and visible wavelengths, we
are unable to reconcile the observed high degree of polarization with such a
model. While the detection of polarized emission from HZRGs has been shown to
be a common phenomena, 3C~256 is only the third object for which a measurement
of the extended polarized UV emission has been presented. These data lend
additional support to the suggestion first made by di Serego Alighieri and
collaborators that the ``alignment effect'', the tendency for the extended UV
continuum radiation and line emission from HZRGs to be aligned with the major
axis of the extended radio emission, is in large part due to scattering of
anisotropic nuclear emission.

hydrogen, i.e., that of a DA star. From modelling these lines, the mass of a
white dwarf can, in principle, be determined accurately, thus leading to
constraints on the evolution of the binary and the mass of the neutron star.
Our present spectrum is not of sufficient quality to set a strong limit, but it
does indicate that the white dwarf most likely has a low mass. This is
consistent with the star being a helium white dwarf, as would be expected from
considerations of the mass function and the preceding evolution. From similar
considerations, the companion of PSR 0655+64 is expected to be a more massive,
carbon-oxygen white dwarf. This is confirmed by our spectra, which show the
Swan bands of molecular carbon, making it a DQ star. Unlike what is observed in
other DQ stars, the strength of the Swan C2 bands changes drastically, by a
factor two in about two hours. We suggests this reflects large-scale surface
inhomogeneities which are rotated in and out of the observed hemisphere. If so,
this would imply that the white dwarf rotates supersynchronously.

transition is of the second order. In the presence of the bare Chern-Simons

the parity is explicitly broken. However it is shown that the existence of the
