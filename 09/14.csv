are more easily visible in the deeper, ground-based IR images. The V-H colors
obtained by combining the HST and IR data are compatible with normal galaxy
colors at the redshifts of the quasars. This behavior can be explained if the
hosts are massive early-type galaxies. All together, HST images have been
reported for 15 luminous quasars, approximately 13 of which have smooth

phenomenological predictivity, and second, we consider the new features
appearing when several moduli fields contribute to SUSY breaking. Although some
qualitative features indeed change in the multimoduli case with respect to the
dilaton dominance one, the most natural mass relations at low-energy $m_l < m_q
\simeq M_g$ are still similar. We also study the presence of tachyons pointing
out that their possible existence may be, in some cases, an interesting
advantage in order to break extra gauge symmetries. Finally, we find that the
mechanism for generating a ``$\mu $-term'' by the K\""ahler potential, as
naturally implemented in orbifolds, leads to the prediction $|tg\beta |=1$ at
the String scale, independently of the Goldstino direction. In this connection,
it is worth noticing that in the dilaton-dominated case we obtain the
remarkable result that the whole SUSY spectrum is completely determined with no

functions, we discuss the possibility of unifying them in the whole $x$ and
$Q^2$ range. We emphasize that the main problem is related to the constraint of
angular ordering of the radiation, and the cancellation of the related
collinear singularities for inclusive processes. At the leading log\ $1/x$ and
log\ $Q^2$ level, we write down a unified system of equations satisfying this
cancellation constraint. At low $x$, it leads to a less singular behaviour of
the structure functions than the BFKL prediction.

an analogous ``weak"" dipole coupling to the $Z$, $CP$ violation in the process
$e^+e^- \rightarrow t \bar t$ leads to the polarization of the top and
anti-top. This polarization can be analyzed by studying the energy and angular
distributions of a decay charged lepton (anti-lepton) when the top (anti-top)
decays leptonically. We have obtained analytic expressions for these
distributions when either $t$ or $\overline t$ decays leptonically. We study
two types of simple $CP$-violating angular asymmetries which do not need tof
simple $CP$-violating angular asymmetries which do not need the full
reconstruction of the $t$ or $\bar t$. These together can help to determine the
electric and weak dipole form factors independently. We have also shown how the
use of longitudinal beam polarization can help to do this with only one
asymmetry measurement, and to imprhelp to do this with only one asymmetry
measurement, and to improve the sensitivity.

deformation of the background fields (including the metric of a curved

diagonal associated with this deformation. Especial attention is payed to the
low-energy approximation corresponding to the strong slowly varying background
fields. We develop a new covariant purely algebraic approach for calculating
the heat kernel diagonal in low-energy approximation by taking into account a
finite number of low-order covariant derivatives of the background fields, and
neglecting all covariant derivatives of higher orders. Then there exist a set
of covariant differential operators that together with the background fields
and their low-order derivatives generate a finite dimensional Lie algebra. In
the zeroth order of the low-energy perturbation theory, determined by
covariantly constant background, we use this algebraic structure to present the
heat operator in the form of an average over the corresponding Lie group. This
simplifies considerably the calculations and allows to obtain closed explicitly
covariant formulas for the heat kernel diagonal. These formulas serve as the
generating functions for the whole sequence of the Hadamard-Minakshisundaram-
De Witt-Seeley coefficients in the low-energy approximation.
