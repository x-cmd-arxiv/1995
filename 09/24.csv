meson, are on the threshold of a new era as experiments approach Standard-Model
sensitivities in decays of beauty, charm, and hyperons. The array of
heavy-quark experiments approved and planned at Fermilab may lead to a
significant breakthrough in the next five to ten years.

fraction of $\psi^\prime$'s produced at the Tevatron. If the
`$\psi^\prime$-anomaly' is explained by gluon fragmentation into a colour octet
Fock component of the $\psi^\prime$, the $\psi^\prime$'s should be $100\%$
transversely polarized at leading order in $\alpha_s$, up to spin symmetry
breaking long-distance corrections. We find that the short-distance correction
to the transverse polarization fraction is a few percent, so that a
polarization measurement would provide a reliable test of the colour octet
mechanism.

"hep-th/9509131",,"Paul Federbush","A Gauge-Invariant Regularization of the Weyl Determinant Using Wavelets","11 pages, latex",,,,"hep-th",,"  In line with a previous paper, a gauge-invariant regularization is developed
for the Weyl determinant of a Euclidean gauged chiral fermion. We restrict
ourselves to gauge configurations with the $A$ field going to zero at infinity
in Euclidean space; and thus restrict gauge transformations to those with $U$
the identity at infinity. For each finite cutoff one gets a strictly
gauge-invariant expression for the Weyl determinant. Full Euclidean invariance
is only to be sought in the limit of removing the cutoff. We expect the limit
to be Euclidean invariant, but this has not yet been proved. One need not
enforce the no-anomaly condition on the representation of the gauge group! We
leave to future research relating the present results to conventional physics
wisdom.
