morphology of tidal tails to variations of the halo mass distributions in the
parent galaxies. Our goal is to constrain the mass of dark halos in well-known
merging pairs. We concentrate on prograde encounters between equal mass
galaxies which represent the best cases for creating tidal tails, but also look
at systems with different relative orientations, orbital energies and mass
ratios. As the mass and extent of the dark halo increase in the model galaxies,
the resulting tidal tails become shorter and less massive, even under the most
favorable conditions for producing these features. Our simulations imply that
the observed merging galaxies with long tidal tails ($\sim 50-100$ kpc) such as
NGC 4038/39 (the Antennae) and NGC 7252 probably have halo:disk+bulge mass
ratios less than 10:1. These results conflict with the favored values of the
dark halo mass of the Milky Way derived from satellite kinematics and the
timing argument which give a halo:disk+bulge mass ratio of $\sim 30:1$.
However, the lower bound of the estimated dark halo mass in the Milky Way (mass
ratio $\sim 10:1$) is still consistent with the inferred tidal tail galaxy
masses. Our results also conflict with the expectations of $\Omega=1$
cosmologies such as CDM which predict much more massive and extended dark
halos.

along distorted orbital trajectories are included in source terms which
oscillate with local orbital phase. Linear analyses show that the excitation of
the instability is essentially local, i.e. insensitive to radial boundary

negligible growth, allowing the instability to become global. The global growth
rate depends the maximum local growth rate, the size of the rapid growth

the excitation of waves with $m\ne 1$ when the local growth rate is large.

is addressed. We define geodesics as curves whose tangent vector moves by
parallel transport. This is different from what other authors have done,
because their definition of geodesics only involves the Christoffel connection,
though studying theories with torsion. We propose a preliminary definition of
singularities which is based on timelike or null geodesic incompleteness, even
though for theories with torsion the paths of particles are not geodesics. The
study of the geodesic equation for cosmological models with torsion shows that
the definition has a physical relevance. It can also be motivated, as done in
the literature, remarking that the causal structure of a space-time with
torsion does not get changed with respect to general relativity. We then prove
how to extend Hawking's singularity theorem without causality assumptions to
the space-time of the ECSK theory. This is achieved studying the generalized
Raychaudhuri equation in the ECSK theory, the conditions for the existence of
conjugate points and properties of maximal timelike geodesics. Hawking's
theorem can be generalized, provided the torsion tensor obeys some conditions.
Thus our result can also be interpreted as a no-singularity theorem if these
additional conditions are not satisfied. In other words, it turns out that the
occurrence of singularities in closed cosmological models based on the ECSK
theory is less generic than in general relativity. Our work is to be compared
with previous papers in the literature. There are some relevant differences,
because we rely on a different definition of geodesics, we keep the field
equations of the ECSK theory in their original form rather than casting them in
a form similar to general relativity with a modified energy momentum tensor,

the type-II string compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold with Betti numbers
$b_{1,1}=2$ and $b_{1,2}=86$. We show that the exact duality symmetry found
from the type II realization contains the perturbative duality group of the
heterotic model, as well as the exact quantum monodromies of the rigid $SU(2)$
super-Yang-Mills theory. Moreover, it contains a non-perturbative monodromy
which is stringy in origin and corresponds roughly to an exchange of the string
coupling with the compactification radius.

making use of the finite temperature renormalization group equation up to the
one-loop order in the background field method with the Feynman gauge and the
imaginary time formalism. The results are compared with the ones obtained in
the literature. We point out, in particular, the origin of the discrepancies
between different calculations, such as the choice of gauge, the break-down of
Lorentz invariance, imaginary versus real time formalism and the applicability
of the Ward identities at finite temperature.

theories are investigated within a Pauli-Villars regularization scheme. For
on-shell theories {\it i.e.}, with open algebras or on-shell reducible
theories, the antifield dependence is cohomologically non trivial. The
associated Wess-Zumino term depends also on antifields. In the classical basis
the antifield independent part of the WZ term is expressed in terms of the
anomaly and finite gauge transformations by introducing gauge degrees of
freedom as the extra dynamical variables. The complete WZ term is reconstructed
from the antifield independent part.
