This additional scale corresponds to a mass $\sim m_{\rm s}/g_{\rm s}$ where
$m_{\rm s}$ is the square root of the string tension and $g_{\rm s}$ is the
string coupling constant. In four dimensions this coincides with the Planck
mass.

and K.~Pilch on the spectrum of physical states in $\cW_3$ gravity coupled to
$c=2$ matter. In particular, it is shown that the algebra of operators
corresponding to physical states -- defined as a semi-infinite (or BRST)
cohomology of the $\cW_3$ algebra -- carries the structure of a G-algebra. This
G-algebra has a quotient which is isomorphic to the G-algebra of polyvector
fields on the base affine space of $SL(3,\CC)$. Details have appeared
elsewhere. To appear (with title change) in the proceedings of the ``H.S. Green

non-Abelian Chern-Simons (NACS) particles. After a brief introduction to the
subject of NACS particles, we first discuss about the symplectic structure of
various $SU(N)$ coadjoint orbits which are the reduced phase space of $SU(N)$
internal degrees of freedom or isospins. A complete Dirac's constraint analysis
is carried out on each orbit and the Dirac bracket relations among the isospin
variables are calculated. Then, the spatial degrees of freedom and interaction
with external gauge field are introduced by considering the total reduced phase
space which is given by an associated bundle whose fiber is one of the
coadjoint orbits. Finally, the theory is quantized by using the coherent state
method and various quantum mechanical properties are discussed in this
approach. In particular, a coherent state representation of the
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation is given and possible solutions in this
representation are discussed.

  Introduction","41 pages, latex, uuencoded file with 2 figues included",,,"SPhT-95-113, IHES/P/95/85","hep-th cond-mat",,"  We describe applications of (perturbed) conformal field theories to
two-dimensional disordered systems. We present various methods of study~: (i)
{\it A direct method} in which we compute the explicit disorder dependence of
the correlation functions for any sample of the disorder. This method seems to
be specific to two dimensions. The examples we use are disordered versions of
the Abelian and non-Abelian WZW models. We show that the disordered WZW model
over the Lie group $\CG$ at level $k$ is equivalent at large impurity density
to the product of the WZW model over the coset space $\CG^C/\CG$ at level
$(-2h^v)$ times an arbitrary number of copies of the original WZW model. (ii)
{\it The supersymmetric method} is introduced using the random bond Ising model
and the random Dirac theory as examples. In particular, we show that the
relevent algebra is the affine $OSp(2N|2N)$ Lie superalgebra, an algebra with
zero superdimension. (iii) {\it The replica method} is introduced using the
random phase sine-Gordon model as example. We describe particularities of its
renormalization group flow. (iv) {\it A variationnal approach} is also
presented using the random phase sine-Gordon model as example. Lectures

introduce students and researchers to {\it $q$-series,} which are also called
{\it basic hypergeometric series} because of the parameter $q$ that is used as
a base in series that are ``{\it over, above or beyond}'' the {\it geometric
series}. We start by considering $q$-extensions (also called $q$-analogues) of
the binomial theorem, the exponential and gamma functions, and of the beta
function and beta integral, and then progress on to the derivations of rather
general summation, transformation, and expansion formulas, integral
representations, and applications. Our main emphasis is on methods that can be
used to {\bf derive} formulas, rather than to just {\it verify} previously
derived formulas.

Hamiltonian lattices. The lattice is translationally invariant. We argue for
the breaking of permutational symmetry by the new bifurcated periodic orbits.
The case of two coupled oscillators is considered as an example for the
perturbation analysis, where the symmetry breaking can be traced using Poincare
maps. Next we consider a lattice and derive the dependence of the bifurcation
energy on the parameters of the Hamiltonian function in the limit of large
system sizes. A necessary condition for the occurence of the bifurcation is the
repelling of the band edge plane wave's frequency from the linear spectrum with
increasing energy. We conclude that the bifurcated orbits will consequently
exponentially localize in the configurational space.

integrable Hamiltonian systems obtained from the constrained flows of the

systems is constructed. The associated $r$-matrices depend not only on the
spectral parameters, but also on the dynamical variables and, for consistency,
have to obey the classical Yang-Baxter equations of dynamical type. Some new
solutions of classical dynamical Yang-Baxter equations are presented. Thus
these integrable systems provide examples both for the dynamical $r$-matrix and
for the separable Hamiltonian system not having a natural Hamiltonian form.
