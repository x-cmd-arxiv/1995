two-dimensional ( latitude -- height ) numerical model is used to clarify the
relationship between the Hadley circulation and large-scale motions associated
with moist convection. The model is based on the primitive equations including
the moist process, and two kinds of coordinates are used: the spherical
coordinate and the Cartesian coordinate with a uniform rotation. The surface
temperature is externally fixed and the troposphere is cooled by the radiation;
unstable stratification generates large-scale convective motions.
  Dependencies on the surface temperature difference from north to south Delta
T_s are investigated. The numerical results show that a systematic multi-cell
structure exists in every experiment. If the surface temperature is constant
(Delta T_s = 0 ), convective motions are organized in the scale of the Rossby
deformation radius and their precipitation patterns have a periodicity of the
advective time tau_D. As Delta T_s becomes larger, the organized convective
system tends to propagate toward warmer regions. The convective cells
calculated in the Cartesian coordinate model is very similar to those of the
mid-latitudes in the spherical coordinate model. In particular, the Hadley cell
can be regarded as the limit of the convective cells in the equatorial
latitudes.

space-scale decomposition (SSD) has been studied. We show how the power
spectrum can effectively be described by the father function coefficients (FFC)
of the wavelet SSD. We demonstrate that the features of the spectrum, such as
the magnitude, the index of a power law, and the typical scales, can be
determined with high precision by the FFC reconstructed spectrum. This method
does not require the mean density, which normally is poorly determined. The
problem of the complex geometry of observed samples can also be easily solved
because the basis are always orthogonal, regardless the geometry of the
samples. Using this method, we examine the spectra inferred from Ly$\alpha$
forests of both simulated and real samples. We find that 1.) the magnitude of
the 1-D spectra is significantly dfferent froma Poisson process; 2) the 1-d
spectra are flat on scales less than 5 h$^{-1}$ Mpc, and increase slowly at
larger ranges; 3.) the reconstructed 3-D spectra have about the same power as
the COBE normalized linear spectrum of the SCDM model on scales less than 40
h$^{-1}$ Mpc, but is larger than the SCDM model on scales larger than 40

are larger than those of low redshift ($z<2.51$).

  To appear in the proceedings of the XXXth MORIOND meeting: ""Clustering in the
  Universe""",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The scaling ansatz of Hamilton et al. effectively extends the idea of
self-similar scaling to initial power spectra of any generic shape.
Applications of this ansatz have provided a semi-empirical analytical
description of gravitational clustering which is extremely useful. This
contribution examines the two theoretical ingredients that form the basis of
these applications: self-similar evolution and the stable clustering
hypothesis. A brief summary of work verifying self-similar scaling for scale
free spectra $P(k) \propto k^n$, with $n < -1$ is given. The main results
presented here examine the hypothesis that clustering is statistically stable
in time on small scales, or equivalently that the mean pair velocity in
physical coordinates is zero. The mean pair velocity of particles can be
computed accurately from N-body simulations via the pair conservation equation,
by using the evolution of the autocorrelation function $\xi(x,t)$. The results
thus obtained for scale free spectra with $n = 0, -1, -2$ and for the CDM
spectrum are consistent with the stable clustering prediction on the smallest
resolved scales, on which the amplitude of $\xi \gsim 200-1000$ for $n = -2$
and $n = 0$, respectively.

qualitatively better fit and better controllable convergence. Futhermore, we

Active Galactic Nuclei is thermal emission from an accretion disk. Previous
studies have shown that fitting the spectra with the standard, optically thick
and geometrically thin accretion disk models often led to luminosities which
contradict the basic assumptions adopted in the standard model. There is no
known reason why the accretion rates in AGN should not be larger than the thin
disk limit. In fact, more general, slim accretion disk models are
self-consistent even for moderately super-Eddington luminosities. We calculate
here spectra from a set of thin and slim, optically thick accretion disks. We
discuss the differences between the thin and slim disk models, stressing the
implications of these differences for the interpretation of the observed
properties of AGN. We found that the spectra can be fitted not only by models
with a high mass and a low accretion rate (as in the case of thin disk fitting)
but also by models with a low mass and a high accretion rate. In the first case
fitting the observed spectra in various redshift categories gives black hole
masses around 10^9 solar masses for a wide range of redshifts, and for
accretion rates ranging from 0.4 to 8 solar masses/year. In the second case the
accretion rate is around 10^2 solar masses/year for all AGN and the mass ranges
from 3*10^6 to 10^8 solar masses. Unlike the disks with a low accretion rate,
the spectra of the high-accretion-rate disks extend into the soft X-rays. A
comparison with observations shows that such disks could produce the soft X-ray
excesses claimed in some AGNs. We show also that the sequence of our models
with fixed mass and different accretion rates can explain the time evolution of
the observed spectra in Fairall 9.

show that in the presence of parity symmetry the trace formula decomposes in an
elegant manner such that for the cardioid billiard the diffractive orbits have
no effect on the odd spectrum. Including diffractive orbits helps resolve peaks
in the density of even states but does not appear to affect their positions. An

estimated using a set of realistic loops generated by loop fragmentation. The

minimum mass-per-unit length $\mu_{\rm min}$ necessary for the cosmic string
loop to form a black hole according to the hoop conjecture is $\mu_{\rm min} =
R /(2 G L)$. Analyzing $25,576$ loops, we obtain the empirical estimate $f_{\rm

loops which collapse to form black holes as a function of the mass-per-unit
length $\mu$ in the range $10^{-3} \lesssim G\mu \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-2}$. We
use this power law to extrapolate to $G\mu \sim 10^{-6}$, obtaining the
fraction $f_{\rm BH}$ of physically interesting cosmic string loops which
collapse to form black holes within one oscillation period of formation.
Comparing this fraction with the observational bounds on a population of
evaporating black holes, we obtain the limit $G\mu \le 3.1 (\pm 0.7) \times
10^{-6}$ on the cosmic string mass-per-unit-length. This limit is consistent

field theory. We review and summarise the efforts made by us to use finite
temperature field theory to address issues of current interest to cosmologists.
An introduction to both the real time and the imaginary time formalisms is
provided.
  The imaginary time formalism is illustrated by applying it to understand the
interesting possibilty of Late Time Phase Transitions. Recent observations of
the space distribution of quasars indicate a very notable peak in space density
at a redshift of $2$ to $3$. It is pointed out that this may be the result of a
phase transition which has a critical temperature of roughly a few meV (in the
cosmological units, $~\hbar = c =k = 1$), which is natural in the context of
massive neutrinos. In fact, the neutrino masses required for quasar production
and those required to solve the solar neutrino problem by the MSW mechanism are
consistent with each other. As a bonus, the cosmological constant implied by
this model may also help resolve the discrepancy between the recently measured
value of the Hubble Constant and the age of the universe.
  We illustrate the real time formalism by studying one of the most important
time-dependent and non-equilibrium phenomena associated with phase transitions.
The non-equilibrium dynamics of the first stage of the reheating process, that
is dissipation via particle production is studied in scalar field theories. We
show that a complete understanding of the mechanism of dissipation via particle
production requires a non-perturbative resummation. We then study

dynamical zero mode of a gluon and a constrained mode of the scalar field. The
latter satisfies a linear constraint, suggesting no nontrivial vacua in the
present paradigm for symmetry breaking on the light-cone. I develop a
diagrammatic method to solve the constraint equation. In the adiabatic
approximation I compute the quantum mechanical potential governing the
dynamical gauge mode. Due to a condensation of the lowest omentum modes of the
dynamical gluons, a centrifugal barrier is generated in the adiabatic
potential. In the present theory however, the barrier height appears too small
to make any impact in this odel. Although the theory is superrenormalisable on
naive powercounting grounds, the removal of ultraviolet divergences is
nontrivial when the constrained mode is taken into account. The open aspects of
this problem are discussed in detail.

approaches because it is the sector of zero transverse momentum gluons of pure
glue QCD(2+1), where the scalar field is the remnant of the transverse gluon
component. We use the Hamiltonian formalism in the gauge $\partial_- A^+ = 0$.
What survives is the dynamical zero mode of $A^+$, which in other theories
gives topological structure and degenerate vacua. With a point-splitting
regularization designed to preserve symmetry under large gauge transformations,
an extra $A^+$ dependent term appears in the current $J^+$. This is reminiscent
of an (unwanted) anomaly. In particular, the gauge invariant charge and the
similarly regulated $P^+$ no longer commute with the Hamiltonian. We show that
nonetheless one can construct physical states of definite momentum which are
not {\it invariant} under large gauge transformations but do {\it transform} in
a well-defined way. As well, in the physical subspace we recover vanishing {\it
expectation values} of the commutators between the gauge invariant charge,

$f(z)=z^2+c$ with $c$ real, $0\in J$, for a positive line measure set of
parameters $c$.

high-energy semi-inclusive $(e,e'p)$ reactions, using an improved theoretical
input, discussed by Nikolaev et al. We establish that neglect of
$NN$-correlations between the knocked-out and core nucleons reduces nuclear
transparencies by $\approx 15 \%$ for light, to $\approx 10\%$ for heavy
nuclei. About the same is predicted for transparencies, integrated over the
transverse or longitudinal momentum of the outgoing proton. Hadron dynamics
predicts a roughly constant $\cal T$ beyond $Q^2\approx $2 GeV$^2$, whereas for
all targets the largest measured data point $Q^2$=6.7 GeV$^2$ appears to lie
above that plateau. Large error bars on those data-points preclude a conclusion
regarding the onset of colour transparency.

surface gravitational redshift for neutron stars using various equations of
state (EOS). Modern meson-exchange potential models are used to evaluate the
$G$-matrix for asymmetric nuclear matter. We calculate both a non-relativistic
and a relativistic EOS. Of importance here is the fact that relativistic
Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations for symmetric nuclear matter fit the
empirical data, which are not reproduced by non-relativistic calculations.
Relativistic effects are known to be important at high densities, giving an
increased repulsion. This leads to a stiffer EOS compared to the EOS derived
with a non-relativistic approach. Both the non-relativistic and the
relativistic EOS yield moments of inertia and redshifts in agreement with the
accepted values. The relativistic EOS yields, however, too large mass and
radius. The implications are discussed.

We construct an associative algebra $A_g(V)$ and a pair of functors between the
category of $A_g(V)$-modules and a certain category of admissible $g$-twisted
$V$-modules. In particular, these functors exhibit a bijection between the
simple modules in each category. We give various applications, including the
fact that the complete reducibility of admissible $g$-twisted modules implies
both the finite-dimensionality of homogeneous spaces and the finiteness of the
number of simple $g$-twisted modules.

Specht modules of $H_n(q)$ which are irreducible in the generic case, and
possess a natural basis indexed by Young tableaux. The general framework in
which the irreducible non-generic $H_n(q)$-modules are to be constructed is set
up and, in particular, the full set of modules corresponding to two-part
partitions is described. Plentiful examples are given.
