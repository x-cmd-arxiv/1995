rotational and magnetic axes are oriented so that only one of the magnetic
poles produces emission directed at the Earth. In this Single Polar Cap (SPC)
scenario, even sources whose light curves have two distinct peaks (Crab, Vela,
Geminga, PSR B1951+32) are due to emission concentrated near the rim of a
single PC. If the inclination alpha is comparable to the half-width of the PC
gamma-beam, alpha ~ theta_{b}, the peak-to-peak phase separation can have the
large values (0.4 - 0.5) observed from these sources. In the model presented
here we attribute the observed interpeak emission to pair cascades above the PC
interior. Our simulation assumes the physics of conventional PC models, in
which the gamma rays are due to photon-pair cascades initiated by curvature
radiation from the acceleration of electrons above the PCs. In this work we
assume that the acceleration occurs over a finite region which may extend up to
several radii above the neutron star surface. We find that the combined effects
of moderately enlarged PC dimensions and extended acceleration zones resolve a
major difficulty with earlier PC models, namely their small beam widths (and
hence small detection probabilities). Our best fits to the observed light
curves are obtained from models in which the accelerated electrons have a
uniform surface density over the PC interior and a sharp density increase of 3
- 5 near the rim.

faint (B > 24) galaxies seen in deep images of the sky are small low-mass
galaxies that experienced starburst at 0.5<z<1 and have since faded into low
luminosity, low surface brightness objects. We scrutinize this hypothesis in
order to determine whether such a model can account for the observed
wavelength- dependent number counts as well as redshift, color and size
distributions. Low-mass galaxies generically arise in large numbers in
hierarchical clustering scenarios. Although expected to form at high redshifts,
the metagalactic UV radiation at high redshifts will delay significant star
formation (SF) activity in these galaxies until z < 1. We combine these two
elements, along with simple assumptions about SF histories and efficiency, to
construct our bursting dwarf model. We further augment the model with a
phenomenological prescription for the formation and evolution of the locally
observed galaxies, and use spectral synthesis/Monte-Carlo methods to generate
realistic galaxy catalogs for comparison with observations. For reasonable
choices of SF histories for the low-mass galaxies, the model results are in
very good agreement with the results of the deep galaxy surveys. Moreover, the
results of deep HST imaging studies, of gravitational lensing and galaxy
clustering studies, and of regular galaxies at intermediate/high redshifts
favor the dwarf-dominated model. We also discuss some generic predictions of
the model. For example, the model predicts that the K-band number counts should
begin to rise more steeply at magnitudes fainter than K_{AB} = 24-25 and the
local field luminosity function should steepen at magnitudes fainter than M_B
\approx -16. We also consider the possibility of detecting the low surface

For large Omega the presence of a very steep rise in the spectrum towards low

show that there are a range of closed models which are consistent with

emission caused by Hawking radiation. In the case of cosmological particle
emission from the event horizon in De Sitter space, it is known that the scalar
wave functions are solved in terms of Legendre functions. For fields with
higher spin, the solution has been examined with low frequency approximation.
We shows that the radial equations of the fields with spin $0,1/2,1$ and $2$
can be solved analytically in terms of the hypergeometric functions. We
calculate the absorption probability using asymptotic expansion for high
frequency limit. It turns out that the absorption coefficients are universal to
all bosonic fields; They depend only on the angular momentum and not spin. In
the case of spin $1/2$ fermions, we can also find non-vanishing absorption
probability in contrast to the previously known result.
