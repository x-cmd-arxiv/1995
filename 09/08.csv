is setting an upper limit to the star formation rate per unit area. All
starbursts in our sample contain UV bright star clusters indicating that
cluster formation is an important mode of star formation in starbursts. On
average about 20% of the UV luminosity comes from these clusters. The brightest
clusters, or super star clusters (SSC), are preferentially found at the very
heart of starbursts. The size of the nearest SSCs are consistent with those of
Galactic globular clusters. The luminosity function of SSCs is well represented
by a power law with a slope alpha ~ -2. There is a strong correlation between
the far infrared excess and the UV spectral slope. The correlation is well
modeled by a geometry where much of their dust is in a foreground screen near
to the starburst, but not by a geometry of well mixed stars and dust.

adjusted apparent magnitude of the red clump stars in these fields (Stanek et
al.~1994, 1995) cannot be assigned to a large-scale gradient of the selective
extinction coefficient. This strengthens the implication of this difference as

hole candidates, six of which have estimated masses. In this review we focus on
two parameters of interest: the ratio of ``non-thermal"" to total luminosity as
a function of the total luminosity divided by the Eddington luminosity, and the
root mean square (rms) variability as a function of the non-thermal to total
luminosity ratio. Below $\sim 10\%$ Eddington luminosity, the sources tend to
be strictly non-thermal (the so called ``off"" and ``low"" states). Above this
luminosity the sources become mostly thermal (the ``high"" state), with the
non-thermal component increasing with luminosity (the ``very high"" and ``flare""
states). There are important exceptions to this behavior, however, and no
steady -- as opposed to transient -- source has been observed over a wide range
of parameter space. In addition, the rms variability is positively correlated
with the ratio of non-thermal to total luminosity, although there may be a
minimum level of variability associated with ``thermal'' states. We discuss
these results in light of theoretical models and find that currently no single
model describes the full range of black hole high energy behavior. In fact, the
observations are exactly opposite from what one expects based upon simple
notions of accretion disk instabilities.

leading order (tree level)-we extend these to include loop corrections. For
scale-free initial power spectra, the one-loop variance \sigma^2 = \sigma^2_l +
1.82 \sigma^4_l and the skewness S_3 = 34/7 + 9.8 \sigma^2_l, where \sigma_l is
the rms fluctuation of the linear density field. We also compute loop
corrections to the variance, skewness, and kurtosis for several non-linear
approximation schemes, where the calculation can be easily generalized to
1-point cumulants of higher order and arbitrary number of loops. We find that
the Zel'dovich approximation gives the best approximation to the loop
corrections of exact perturbation theory, followed by the Linear Potential

agreement with the relative behavior of tree-level results. In LPA and FFA,
loop corrections are infrared divergent for spectral indices n < 0; this is
related to the breaking of Galilean invariance in these schemes.

improved stellar evolution models of halo stars. Current stellar evolution
models do not match the observed $^7$Li abundance patterns, suggesting that the
input physics and/or the assumptions used in constructing the models are in
need of revision. It appears that all halo stars have suffered some $^7$Li
depletion, implying that the primordial $^7$Li abundance is higher than that
presently observed in hot halo stars. Observations of abundances of various
elements in globular cluster giant branch stars have suggested for some time
now that some form of deep mixing, which is not present in theoretical models,
occurs in halo stars. The driving mechanism for this mixing, and its
incorporation into stellar models remain one of the key problems in stellar
modeling. Current theoretical isochrones are able to provide a good match to
observed colour-magnitude diagrams. However, there is some evidence that the
theoretical luminosity functions are in disagreement with observations. This is
an area which requires further study, as it suggests that the relative main
sequence/giant branch lifetimes predicted by the models are incorrect. A
discussion of some of the uncertainties involved in determining the ages of
globular clusters is presented. The absolute ages of globular clusters provide
a lower bound to the age of the universe, and so are of great interest to
cosmologists. Unfortunately, present uncertainties in stellar models lead to a
rather large range in the inferred ages of globular clusters of 11 -- 18 Gyr.

has been done from just dual properties of radiation's and strictly homogeneous
relationships for nonlocal cases in G fields. This way reduces the number of
independent variables and puts into relief (and avoid) important inhomogeneity
errors of some G theories. It unifies and accounts for basic principles and
postulates physics. The results for gravity depend on linear radiation
properties but not on arbitrary field relations. They agree with the
conventional tests. However they have some fundamental differences with current
G theories. The particle model, at a difference of the conventional theories,
also fixes well-defined cosmological and astrophysical models that are
different from the rather conventional ones. They have been described and
tested with the astronomical observations. These tests have been resumed in a
separated work to be sent to the astro Archive.
