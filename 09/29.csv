the standard cold dark matter (CDM) spectrum. The difference is of order
$5-10%$ for $400 < l < 1000 $ for currently popular CHDM models. With
semi-analytic approximations, we also discuss the relevant physics involved.
Finally we remark on the ability of future experiments to differentiate between
these models. An all-sky experiment with a beam size smaller than 30 arcminutes
can distinguish between CHDM and CDM if other cosmological parameters are
known. Even allowing other parameters to vary, it may be possible to
distinguish CDM from CHDM.

observed properties of clusters include the velocity dispersion versus
temperature relation, the gas mass versus total mass relation, and the gas mass
fraction versus velocity dispersion relation. We find that, while both
cosmological models reproduce well the shape of these observed functions, only
low-density CDM can reproduce the observed amplitudes. The cluster gas mass
fraction reflects approximately the baryon fraction in the models, with a
slight anti-bias. Therefore, due to the low baryon density given by
nucleosynthesis, Omega = 1 models produce too few baryons in clusters compared
with observations. Scaling our results as a function of Omega, we find that a
low-density CDM model, with Omega approximately 0.3 - 0.4, best reproduces the
observed mean baryon fraction in clusters. The observed beta parameter of
clusters, beta = sigma^2/(k T/mu m_p) = 0.94 \pm 0.08 discriminates less well

single pulse to a long complex sequence of chaotic pulses of different
timescales. I studied light curves of GRBs using data from the CGRO's BATSE
experiment and found that the average post-peak time history for a sample of
460 bursts obeys an unique and simple analytical law: $I \sim
\exp(-(t/t_0)^{1/3})$ where $t$ is time measured from the peak of the event and
$t_0$ is a constant ranging from 0.3 sec for strong bursts to $\sim 1$ sec for
weak bursts. The average peak aligned profile follows this law with good
accuracy in the whole range availible for analysis (from fractions of a second
to $\sim$ 150 seconds after the peak). Such a law with a single time constant
characterising the overall sample of GRBs should have important physical
meaning. The dependence of $t_0$ versus brightness of GRBs is presented. The
fact that $t_0$ depends on the brightness apparantly confirms the recently
discovered effect of time dilation of weak bursts which has a possible
cosmological interpretation. The time dilation is detected at a confidence
level of $7\sigma$ and it is slightly larger than was previously reported.

  figures available via anonymous ftp at ftp://brmha.mit.edu/papers/ftp/",,"10.1086/177240",,"astro-ph",,"  We check the validity of the widely used classical apsidal motion formula as
a function of orbital parameters, stellar structure, and stellar rotation rate
by comparing dynamical calculations of the periastron advance with the static
tidal formula. We find that the classical formula gives very accurate results
when the periods of the low order quadrupole g, f and p modes are smaller than
the periastron passage time by a factor of about 7 or more. However, when this
condition is not satisfied, the difference between the classical formula and
the exact result can be quite large, and even periastron recession can result.
The largest difference arises when one of the low order modes of the star is
nearly resonant with an integer multiple of the orbital frequency minus twice
the rotation rate of the star. The resonance of higher order g-modes (number of
radial nodes $\gta 4$) with the orbit is very unlikely to cause significant
deviation from the classical result because of their weak coupling to the tidal
force and thus their small contribution to the apsidal motion. Resonances
involving rotational modes of the star are also unlikely to make much
contribution to the apsidal motion because of their small overlap with the
tidal force, even though they have periods comparable to the periastron passage
time.
  We apply our work to two famous binary systems (AS Cam and DI Her) which show
abnormally small apsidal motion, and conclude that dynamical effects are
unimportant for these systems, i.e. the static tide assumption is an excellent
approximation.

separation. It is replaced by a Luttinger liquid whose elementary excitations
are collective charge and spin modes, based on the exactly solvable Luttinger
model. I review this model and various solutions with emphasis on bosonization
(and its equivalence to conformal field theory), and its physical properties.
The notion of a Luttinger liquid implies that all gapless 1D systems share
these properties at low energies.
  Chapters 1 and 2 of the article contain an introduction and a discussion of
the breakdown of Fermi liquid theory. Chapter 3 describes in detail the
solution of the Luttinger model both by bosonization and by Green's functions
methods and summarizes the properties of the model, expressed thorugh
correlation functions. The relation to conformal field theory is discussed.

describes in much detail the various mappings applied to realistic models of 1D
correlated fermions, onto the Luttinger model, as well as important corrections
to the Luttinger model properties discussed in Ch.3. Chapter 5 describes
situations where the Luttinger liquid is not a stable fixed point, and where
spin or charge gaps open in at least one channel. Chapter 6 discusses
multi-band and multichain problems, in particular the stability of a Luttinger
liquid with respect to interchain hopping. Ch. 7 gives a brief summary of

potentially relevant. For the $\tau$ lepton, the new diagrams are suppressed by
$v_\tau = 2 \sin^2 \theta_W - 1/2$, or by powers of $m_\tau/M_Z$, but may still
be comparable to the SM electroweak contributions. In contrast, we find that
the new contributions for the bottom quark may be much larger than the SM
electroweak contributions. These new effects may even compete with the gluonic
contribution, if the extra scalars are light and $\tan \beta$ is large. We also
comment on the problem of the gauge dependence of the vertex, arising when the
$Z$ is off mass shell. We compute the contributions from the new scalars to the
magnetic dipole moments for top-quark production at the NLC, and for bottom and
$ \tau $ production at LEP2. In the case of the top, we find that the SM
electroweak and gluonic contributions to the $Z t {\bar t}$ vertex are
comparable. The new contributions may be of the same order of magnitude as the
standard-model ones, but not much larger.
