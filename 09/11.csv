piano music by mapping them to one-dimensional walks. Two kinds of correlations
are studied, one is related to the real values of frequencies while they are
treated only as different symbols for another. Long-range power law behavior is
found in both kinds. The first is more meaningful. The structure of music, such

Some interesting features are observed. Our results demonstrate the viewpoint
that the fundamental principle of music is the balance between repetition and

  a Letter in Astronomy and Astrophysics","Astron.Astrophys.302:L21,1995",,"MPK-ASTRO-95-16","astro-ph",,"  The theory of first order Fermi acceleration at shocks assumes that particles
diffuse due to scattering off slow-moving magnetic irregularities. However,
cosmic rays are closely tied to magnetic field lines, and the transport
process, particularly across the direction of the field, is likely to be more
complicated. To describe cross field transport we employ recent extensions of
the Rechester-Rosenbluth theory in localised stochastic regions of magnetic
field. During acceleration at a shock and when the motion along the field is
diffusive, there is a transition at a critical energy from \lq\lq
sub-diffusive\rq\rq\ motion, where the mean square displacement of a particle
increases with time as $t^{1/2}$, to compound diffusion, a combined process
involving diffusion along a magnetic field which is itself wandering. Requiring
this critical energy to be less than the system cut-off in a SNR of radius $R$
places an upper limit on the coherence length, $\lambda$, of the magnetic field
for which diffusive shock acceleration can occur at quasi-perpendicular shocks
when field line wandering dominates the effective transport of particles:
$\lambda<R(U/v)^{1/2}$ where $U$ is the shock speed and $v$ the particle speed.
The acceleration rate for particles in the sub-diffusive regime is derived and
its implication for the origin of high energy cosmic rays is discussed.

the second kind at constant pressure $P$ and variable temperature $T$ is
proposed. Equilibrium states of a system at zero external field and fixed $P$
and $T$ are described by points in three-dimensional space with coordinates
$\eta$, the order parameter, $T$, the temperature and $\phi$, the thermodynamic
potential. These points form the so-called zero field curve in the $(\eta, T,
\phi)$ space. Its branch point coincides with the critical point of the system.
The small parameter of the theory is the distance from the critical point along
the zero-field curve. It is emphasized that no explicit functional dependency
of $\phi$ on $\eta$ and $T$ is imposed. It is shown that using $(\eta, T,
\phi)$ space one cannot overcome well-known difficulties of the Landau theory
of phase transitions and describe non-analytical behavior of real systems in
the vicinity of the critical point. This becomes possible only if one increases
the dimensionality of the space, taking into account the dependency of the
thermodynamic potential not only on $\eta$ and $T$, but also on near (local)
order parameters $\lambda_{i}$. In this case under certain conditions it is
possible to describe anomalous increase of the specific heat when the
temperature of the system approaches the critical point from above as well as
from below the critical temperature $T_{c}$.

energy-momentum tensor and supersymmetry generators of non-critical superstring
theories with minimal matter as those of topological supergravity. Superstrings
with $N=1$ and $N=2$ world-sheet supersymmetry are considered. The topological
symmetry associated with the topological supergravity representation is
studied. It is shown, in particular, that the compatibility of this topological
structure with the supersymmetry enhances the superconformal symmetry of the
models concerned.

fractal dimension of the distribution of the final modes excited. The ambiguous
role of the largest Lyapunov exponent for unstable systems is also critically
reviewed.

class-sum of transpositions of the symmetric group $S_{n}$. Irreducible
representations of $H_{n}(q)$, for generic $q$, are shown to be completely
characterized by the corresponding eigenvalues of $C_{n}$ alone. For $S_{n}$
more and more invariants are necessary as $n$ inereases. It is pointed out that
the $q$-deformed classical quadratic Casimir of $SU(N)$ plays an analogous
role. It is indicated why and how this should be a general phenomenon
associated with $q$-deformation of classical algebras. Apart from this
remarkable conceptual aspect $C_{n}$ can provide powerful and elegant
techniques for computations. This is illustrated by using the sequence $C_{2}$,
$C_{3}, \cdots,\; C_{n}$ to compute the characters of $H_{n}(q)$.

regime is analyzed. In this regime, a variety of non--classical states of
motion can be prepared either by using laser pulses of well defined area, or by
an adiabatic passage scheme based on the variation of the laser frequency. We
show how these states can be used to investigate fundamental properties of
quantum mechanics. We also study possible applications of this system to build
an ion interferometer.
