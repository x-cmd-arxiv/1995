galaxies, adopting the bimodal star formation scenario of Elbaz, Arnaud &
Vangioni-Flam (1995). These models utilise an initial mass function (IMF)
biased heavily toward massive stars during the early phases of galactic
evolution, leading to early Type II supernovae-driven galactic winds. A
subsequent lengthy, milder, star formation phase with a normal IMF ensues,
responsible supposedly for the stellar population observed today. Based upon
chemical evolution arguments alone, this scenario has been invoked to explain
the observed metal mass, and their abundance ratios, in the intracluster medium
of galaxy clusters. Building upon the recent compilations of
metallicity-dependent isochrones for simple stellar populations, we have
constructed a coupled photometric and chemical evolution package for composite
stellar populations in order to quantify the effects of such a model upon the
photo-chemical properties of the resultant elliptical galaxies. We demonstrate
that these predicted properties are incompatible with those observed at the
current epoch.

Group , and the production of mock catalogs that mimic in detail current
catalogs of redshifts and peculiar velocities. Our main purpose is to provide a
tool for developing and testing reconstruction methods, but the different
components of the method can be used on their own in other applications. The
initial conditions are based on the IRAS 1.2Jy redshift survey, assuming that
galaxies trace mass and \Omega=1. A density field smoothed is recovered from
the redshift survey, using quasi-linear theory and a power-preserving filter.
The corresponding potential field is traced back to the linear regime using the
Zel'dovich-Bernoulli equation. Small-scale power is added by means of
constrained realization to mimic fluctuations on galactic scales. The
gravitating system is evolved forward in time with a PM code of 2\hmpc
resolution. The result reproduces the real dynamical structures on large scales
and the statistical properties of the structure down to galactic scales.
""Galaxies"" are identified via a linear biasing scheme (b=1.35) and they are
divided into ""spirals"" and ""ellipticals"" to obey Dressler's morphology-density
relation. The galaxies are assigned internal-velocity parameters and absolute
magnitudes scattered about an assumed mean Tully-Fisher relation. They are then
""observed"" as magnitude-limited samples, trying to mimic the selection criteria
of the data sets constituting the Mark III catalog of peculiar velocities.
Artificial IRAS 1.2Jy redshift surveys are also compiled. The simulations and
mock catalogs will be made available electronically as bench marks for testing
reconstruction methods.

that the disc is geometrically thick and hot. Accretion occurs due to the
overflow of the effective potential barrier near the black hole, similar to the
case of the Roche lobe overflowing star in a binary system. We make no
pre-assumptions on the properties of the flow, instead our models evolve
self-consistently from an initially non-accreting state. The viscosity is due
to the the small-scale turbulence and it is described by the $\alpha$-viscosity
prescription. We confirm earlier suggestions that viscous accretion flows are
convectively unstable. We found that the instability produces transient eddies
of various length-scales. The eddies contribute to the strength of the
viscosity in the flow by redistributing the angular momentum. They also
introduce low amplitude oscillatory variations which have a typical frequency
about $100\; \msun/M$ Hz for a system of mass $M$. This may be relevant to the
high frequency ($\sim 4-10$ Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations observed in the

axisymmetric configuration, constructed by a 2-D general relativistic numerical
code, and taking into account only the dominant terms in the non-axisymmetric
part of the 3-D relativistic equations. For a polytropic equation of state, we
have determined, as a function of the degree of relativity, the critical
adiabatic index $\gamma_{\rm crit}$ above which rapidly rotating stars can
break their axial symmetry. A by-product of the present study is the
confirmation of the Newtonian value $\gamma_{\rm crit} = 2.238$ obtained by
James (1964). We have also considered neutron star models contructed upon
twelve nuclear matter equations of state taken from the literature. We found
that five equations of state from this sample allow the symmetry breaking for
sufficiently high rotation velocities. For the others, the Keplerian velocity
(mass-shedding from the equator) is reached before the axisymmetry is broken.
Rotating neutron stars that break their axial symmetry can be an important

not correspond to a quantum subgroup still have the structure of quantum
quotient spaces. We propose a construction of quantum fibre bundles on such
spaces. The quantum plane and the general quantum two-spheres are discussed in
detail.

equations (averaged Korteveg-de-Vries equation). In contrast with the ordinary
hydrodynamic-type flows these symmetries are nonhomogeneous (i.e. they act
nontrivially at the constant solutions), are nonlocal, explicitly depend upon
space and time coordinates and form a noncommutative algebra, isomorphic to the
algebra of the polynomial vector fields in the complex plane (Virasoro algebra
with the zero central charge).
