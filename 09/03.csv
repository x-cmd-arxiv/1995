Lett. {\bf 76}, 2390 (1996)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.2390",,"cond-mat",,"  We study the out of equilibrium dynamics of an elastic manifold in a random
potential using mean-field theory. We find two asymptotic time regimes: (i)
stationary dynamics, (ii) slow aging dynamics with violation of equilibrium
theorems. We obtain an analytical solution valid for all large times with
universal scalings of two-time quantities with space. A non-analytic scaling
function crosses over to ultrametricity when the correlations become
long-range. We propose procedures to test numerically or experimentally the
extent to which this scenario holds for a given system.

experiments explore the mass range above the current lower bounds on
superpartner masses, a failure to observe signals of superpartner production
will begin to erode the central motivation for supersymmetry at the weak scale.
In this article we present a detailed examination of which regions of
supersymmetric parameter space are most natural and the extent to which
weak-scale supersymmetry becomes unnatural if no superpartners are observed at
LEP-II, the Tevatron, possible upgrades of these machines, and the LHC.
