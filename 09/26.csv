coherent magnetic fields on the weak interaction rates and the electron
thermodynamic functions (\rhoe, \Pe, and \drhoedt ) are unimportant in
comparison to the contribution of the magnetic field energy density in BBN. In
consequence the effect of including magnetic fields in BBN is well approximated
numerically by treating the additional energy density as effective neutrino
number. A conservative upper bound on the primordial magnetic field,
parameterized as $\zeta=2eB_{rms}/(T_\nu^2)$, is $\zeta \le 2$ ($\rho_B < 0.27

the Faraday rotation measures of distant quasars if the cosmological magnetic

globular cluster--like associations or RAMBOs (robust associations of massive
baryonic objects) (Moore \& Silk 1995). Here we investigate the effect such
clustering has on the microlensing of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We
find that the lensing in a one square degree field could be dominated by just a
few clusters. As a result the lensing properties vary widely depending on the
position and velocity of those clusters which happen to lie between us and the
LMC. Moreover we find a large variance in time scale distributions that
suggests that the small number statistics could easily be dominated by events
in the tails of the unclustered distribution ({\it e.g.} by long periods). We
compare our results with the MACHO collaboration's data and find that a
``standard'' halo made entirely of MACHOs is not strongly disfavored if the
clusters have masses of $10^6 M_{\odot}$. For less massive clusters such a halo
is not as likely. For $10^4 M_{\odot}$ clusters the microlensing statistics are
essentially unchanged from the unclustered case. It may be possible to detect
very massive clusters from the distribution of events in time-scale and space.
We provide some example time- scale distributions.

suppresses the formation of dwarf galaxies, and may even inhibit the formation

of the formation of small objects in a CDM universe with and without a
photoionizing background. The objects are selected from a collisionless
simulation at a redshift of 2.4, and rerun at higher resolution including the
effects of gas dynamics and using a hierarchical grid of particles. Five
objects, each with a circular speed of 46 km/sec are simulated. The presence of
the photoionizing background has only a small effect on the amount of gas that
collapses in these objects, reducing the amount of cold collapsed gas by at
most 30%. Analysis of the smaller objects found in the higher resolution
simulation indicates that the photoionizing background only significantly
affects the formation of objects with a virialized halo mass less than 10^9
soalr masses and circular speeds less than 23 km/sec. However, the ionization
balance is greatly changed by the presence of the background radiation field.
Typical lines of sight through the objects have 4 orders of magnitude less

collapse-driven supernovae ever occurred in the universe is calculated by using
a realistic, time-dependent supernova rate derived from a standard model of
galaxy evolution based on the population synthesis method. The SRN spectrum we
show here is the most realistic at present, because the largest uncertainty in
previous theoretical predictions has come from unrealistic assumptions of the
supernova rate so far made. The SRN is one of the targets of the
Superkamiokande (SK) detector which will be constructed in a year and the SRN,
if at all detected, would provide a new tool to probe the history of supernova
explosions in the universe. The expected event rate at the SK is therefore
calculated in this paper. Our major results include: (1) the supernova rate is
much higher in the early phase of evolution of galaxies and there appears a
hump in the SRN spectrum in the low-energy region of $\ltilde 5$ MeV, (2) the
SRN flux depends on the Hubble constant ($H_0$) in a way approximately
proportional to $H_0^2$ and only weakly on the density parameter of the
universe ($\Omega_0$) and a cosmological constant ($\lambda_0$), and (3) the
plausible event rate at the SK is 1.2 yr$^{-1}$ in the observable energy range.
Such a low event rate is due mainly to a quite low supernova rate at present
which is averaged over the morphological types of galaxies. The most optimistic
rate in our model is found to be 4.7 yr$^{-1}$, and if more events are
detected, we will have to reconsider our current understanding of
collapse-driven supernovae and evolution of galaxies.

quantities using operator product expansions is delicate. If dimensional
regularization is used to regulate the ultra-violet divergences then there are
ambiguities in the Wilson coefficient functions due to infra-red renormalon
singularities. With a hard ultra violet cut-off, such as the inverse lattice
spacing $a$, there are no renormalon ambiguities, as a result of cancellations
between terms which in finite orders of perturbation theory diverge as inverse
powers of $a$, and those which diverge at most logarithmically. In this lecture
I review these questions, explaining the steps necessary to obtain predictions
for physical quantities from lattice measurements of matrix elements of higher
dimensional operators. The ideas are illustrated by considering quantities
computed using the heavy quark effective theory beyond leading order in the

the standard minimum becomes metastable and the possibility of decay to the
non-standard one arises. Comparison of the decay rate to the non-standard
minimum at finite (and zero) temperature with the corresponding expansion rate
of the Universe allows to identify the region, in the ($M_H$, $M_t$) plane,

fourth-order theories, described by actions which are general functions of the
scalar curvature, the Ricci tensor and the full Riemann tensor, it is shown
that the higher-derivative theories may have multiple stable vacua. The vacua
are shown to be, in general, non-trivial, corresponding to deSitter or
anti-deSitter solutions of the original theory. It is also shown that around
any vacuum the elementary excitations remain the massless graviton, a massive
scalar field and a massive ghost-like spin-two field. The analysis is extended
to actions which are arbitrary functions of terms of the form $\nabla^{2k}R$,
and it is shown that such theories also have a non-trivial vacuum structure.

  $\hat{sl}_2$","Latex 42 pages",,,,"q-alg math.QA",,"  The admissible modules for $\hat{sl}_2$ are studied from the point of view of
vertex operator algebra. If $l$ is rational such that $l+2={p\over q}$ for some
coprime positive integers $p\ge 2$ and $q$, Kac and Wakimoto found finitely
many distinguished irreducible representations for $\hat{sl}_2$, called
admissible representations. In this paper we prove that the vertex operator
algebra $L(l,0)$ associated to irreducible highest weight representation of $l$
is not rational if $l$ is not a positive integer. However if we change the
Virasoro algebra in certain way, $L(l,0)$ becomes a rational vertex operator
algebra whose irreducible representations are exactly those admissible
representations. We show that the $q$-dimensions with respect to the new
Virasoro algebra are modular functions. We aslo calculate the fusions rules.
