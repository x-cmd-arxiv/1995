investigate some consequences of treating quadratic terms perturbatively
(higher derivative version of backreaction effects). This approach is shown to
overcome some well known problems associated with higher derivative theories,
i.e., the physical gravitational degree of freedom remains unchanged from those
of Einstein gravity.
  Using such an interpretation of $R + \beta R^2$ gravity, we investigate a
classical and Wheeler DeWitt evolution of $R + \beta R^2$ gravity for a
particular sign of $\beta$, corresponding to non- tachyon case. Matter is
described by a phenomenological $\rho \propto a(t)^{-n}$. It is concluded that
both the Friedmann potential $U(a)$ ($ {\dot a}^2 + 2U(a) = 0 $) and the
Wheeler DeWitt potential $W(a)$ ($\left[-{\partial^2\over \partial a^2} +
2W(a)\right]\psi (a) =0 $) develop repulsive barriers near $a\approx 0$ for
$n>4$ (i.e., $ p > {1\over 3}\rho $). The interpretations is clear. Repulsive
barrier in $U(a)$ implies that a contracting FRW universe ($k>0, k=0, k<0$)
will bounce to an expansion phase without a total gravitational collapse.
Repulsive barrier in $W(a)$ means that $a \approx 0$ is a classically forbidden
region. Therefore, probability of finding a universe with the big bang
singularity ($a=0$ ) is exponentially suppressed.

condensates, the dynamically generated quark mass, etc) as well as the vacuum
energy density have been calculated from first principles within a recently
proposed dynamical equations approach to QCD at low energies. The zero modes
enhancement (ZME) model of quark confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry
breaking (DCSB) based on the solution to the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation for
the quark propagator in the infrared (IR) domain was used for this purpose.
There are only two independent quantities by means of which calculations should
be done within our approach. Our unique input data was chosen to be the pion
decay constant in the chiral limit given by the chiral perturbation theory at
the hadronic level (CHPTh). Phenomenological estimates of these quantities, as
well as the vacuum energy density, are in good agreement with our numerical
results. The nonperturbative vacuum structure which emerges from the ZME model,
appears to be well suited to describe quark confinement, DCSB,
current-effective (dynamical)-constituent, as well as constituent-valence quark
transformations, the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule, dimensional transmutation,
etc. The importance of the instanton-type fluctuations in the true QCD vacuum
for the ZME model is also emphasized. This allows to predict new, more
realistic values for the vacuum energy density (apart from the sign, by
definition, the bag constant) and the gluon condensate.
