resulting from nonlinear gravitational instability of initial Gaussian

five power law models reveals that all models show a shift toward a network
topology if seen with high enough resolution. However, quantitatively, the
shift is significantly different in different models: the smaller the spectral
index ,n, the stronger the shift. On the contrary, the shift toward the
""bubble"" topology is characteristic only for the n <= -1 models. We find that
the mean density of the percolating structures in the nonlinear density
distributions generally is very different from the density threshold used to
identify them and corresponds much better to a visual impression. We also find
that the maximum of the number of structures (connected regions above or below
a specified density threshold) in the evolved, nonlinear distributions is
always smaller than in Gaussian fields with the same spectrum, and is
determined by the effective slope at the cutoff frequency.

overshooting models, the convective flux becomes negative shortly after the

and the four \pi orbitals are as follows: Cu_s provides 2nd- and
3rd-nearest-neighbor (t' and t') intra-plane hopping, as well as hopping
between planes (t_{perp}). The \pi -orbitals are responsible for bifurcation of
the saddle-points for dimpled planes. The 4-\sigma-band Hamiltonian is generic
for flat CuO_2 planes and we use it for analytical studies. The reduction of
the \sigma-Hamiltonian to 3- and 1-band Hamiltonians is explicitly discussed

many-body calculations, the 3-band Hamiltonian should include hopping between
all 2nd-nearest-neighbor oxygens and that the 1-band Hamiltonian should include
3rd-nearest-neighbor hoppings. We calculate the single-particle hopping between

space of $(2,2)$ superconformal-field theories, highlighting various aspects of
its phase structure. In particular, we indicate the types of phase diagrams
that emerge for ``generic'' Calabi-Yau theories and review an efficient method
for their determination. We then focus on some special types of phase diagrams
that have bearing on the issues of rigid manifolds, mirror symmetry and
geometrical duality.

which need sources for their support at the origin (in particular, for special
plane waves and fundamental strings) certain `trivial' \a'-corrections (which
are usually ignored since in the absence of sources they can be eliminated by a
field redefinition) may play an important role eliminating the singularities in
the exact solutions. These corrections effectively regularize the source
delta-function at the \a'-scale. We demonstrate that similar smearing of the
singularity of the leading-order point-source solution indeed takes place in
the open string theory.

Several interesting consequences will follow from our computation of
$\lambda_2$. One of them says that $\lambda_2$ is always an integer divisible
by 3. It seems interesting to compare this result with the fact shown by
Murakami that $\lambda_{1}$ is 6 times the Casson invariant. Other consequences
include some general criteria for distinguishing homology 3-spheres obtained
from surgery on knots by using the Jones polynomial.
