of the Milky Way provide constraints on theories of galaxy formation. As one
specific example, the accretion of satellite galaxies similar to the present
retinue of dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) would provide an observable metal-poor,
intermediate-age population. This paper presents a quantitative assessment of
any contribution made by such stars to the stellar halo. The bulk of the
stellar populations in the halo show a well-defined turn-off, at B-V ~ 0.4,
implying that the vast majority of the stars are old. The fraction of stars
which lie blueward of this well-defined turn-off, with metallicities similar to
that of the present dSphs, is used in this paper to place limits on the
importance of the recent accretion of such systems. Very few (< ~ 10%) stars
are found to be bluer (and by implication, younger) than this limit, with the
highest value found for the more metal-rich halo ([Fe/H] >~ -1.5 dex). Direct
comparison of this statistic with the colour distribution of the turnoff stars
in the Carina dwarf allows us to derive an upper limit on the number of mergers
of such satellite galaxies into the halo of the Milky Way. This upper limit is
~ 40 Carina-like galaxies. The higher metallicity data constrain satellite
galaxies like the Fornax dwarf; only <~ 5 of these could have been accreted
within the last < ~ 10 Gyr. We note that the low star-formation rates inferred
for dSphs predict distinctive elemental abundance signatures; future data for
field halo stars, including candidate younger stars, will provide a further
robust test of accretion models.

is a typical result which we cannot obtain in three dimensions by naive

interactions up to second nearest neighbors, are developped for phonon
frequencies of TA(X) and TA(L) modes and the corresponding mode Gruneisen

thermodynamic properties (specific heat, bulk modulus, thermal expansion), and
point out the effect of the negative mode Gruneisen parameters of the acoustic
branches on these properties. Finally, we present the evolution of the mean
square atomic displacement and of the atomic temperature factor with the
temperature for different volumes, for which the anomalous effects are even
greater.

Three cases, one in which the energy and neutrinos produced in the strangeness
production reactions are retained in the reaction region, second in which the
neutrinos are allowed to escape the reaction region but the energy is retained
and the third in which both the energy and neutrinos escape the reaction region
are considered. It is shown that the nonleptonic weak process dominates strange
quark production while semileptonic weak processes, which produce neutrinos,
lead to the cooling if the neutrinos escape the reaction region. It is found
that the time required for the saturation of the strangeness fraction is
between $10^{-7}$ and $10^{-5}$ sec, with the shorter time corresponding to the
first two cases. About 0.2 neutrinos/baryon are emitted during the process in
the first two cases where as the neutrino emission is somewhat suppressed in
the last case. The average energy of the neutrinos produced in all the three
cases is found to be several hundred $MeV$. We also find that a large amount of
energy is released during the strangeness production in the first two cases and
this leads to the heating of the reaction region. Implications of the neutrino
production are investigated.

Different models are used to calculate the composition of nuclear and quark

the neutrino emissivity of nuclear as well as quark matter varies over a wide
range. We find that for nuclear matter, the direct URCA processes are allowed
for most of the relativistic models without and with strange baryons, whereas
for the nonrelativistic models this shows a strong dependence on the type of
nuclear interaction employed. When the direct URCA processes are allowed, the
neutrino emissivity of hadronic matter is larger than that of the quark matter
by several orders of magnitude. We also find that the neutrino emissivity
departs from $T^6$ behavior when the temperature is larger than the difference
in the Fermi momenta of the particles, participating in the neutrino-producing
reactions.

select (classes of) differential calculi on it via the notions of left-, right-
and bicovariance. A corresponding framework has been developed by Woronowicz,
more generally for Hopf algebras including quantum groups. A differential
calculus is regarded as the most basic structure needed for the introduction of
further geometric notions like linear connections and, moreover, for the
formulation of field theories and dynamics on finite sets. Associated with each
bicovariant first order differential calculus on a finite group is a braid
operator which plays an important role for the construction of distinguished
geometric structures. For a covariant calculus, there are notions of invariance
for linear connections and tensors. All these concepts are explored for finite
groups and illustrated with examples. Some results are formulated more
generally for arbitrary associative (Hopf) algebras. In particular, the problem
of extension of a connection on a bimodule (over an associative algebra) to
tensor products is investigated, leading to the class of `extensible
connections'. It is shown that invariance properties of an extensible
connection on a bimodule over a Hopf algebra are carried over to the extension.
Furthermore, an invariance property of a connection is also shared by a `dual
connection' which exists on the dual bimodule (as defined in this work).
