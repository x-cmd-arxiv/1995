with conduction along the field. However, if a flare is heated by a highly
filamented beam directed along the field, then the array of heated cells in a
cross-section of the flare will result in both small spatial scales (with
consequently large temperature gradients) and a large surface area for the
heated volume, providing a geometrical enhancement of the total cross-field
energy flux. To investigate the importance of this filamentary geometry, we
present a simple model of a single heated filament surrounded by an optically
thin radiating shell, obtain an analytical expression for the stable
equilibrium temperature profile within the shell, and use this to impose limits
on the size of filament for which this model is appropriate.
  We find that this mechanism by itself is capable of transporting a power of
the same order as a large flare, with a moderate range of filament sizes. The
length scales are substantially smaller than can be resolved at present,
although they should be regarded as underestimates.

suffers from severe image degradation even when one observes at moderate
declinations. Not only does this effect limit the area of the sky over which
drift scanning is viable, but as detector sizes increase, CCD mosaics become
standard, and dome/telescope seeing improves, the area of sky for which
scanning is acceptable (image degradation $\ltsim$ seeing) will be further
reduced unless some action is taken. By modifying the scan path (the path on
the sky traced by signal accumulated along a single CCD column) to lie along a
great circle on the sky rather than along a path of constant declination, image
degradation is minimized. In this paper, we discuss the design and
implementation of a stage that rotates and translates the CCD during a
drift-scan exposure so that the scan path is along a great circle on the sky.
Data obtained during the commissioning run of the Great Circle Camera at the

do this proved elusive. Instead we found wide absorption bands reminiscent of

found in several strong black-hole candidates. Measurements of the velocity of
the H$\alpha$ line are consistent with an orbital period of 5.1~hours and a
velocity semi-amplitude of the primary of $34 \pm 6$~\kms. These measurements,
when combined with measurements of the velocity semi-amplitude of the secondary
made by others, indicate that the mass ratio $q \sim 0.09$. If the secondary
follows the empirical mass-radius relation found for CVs, the low $q$ implies a
primary mass of $M_x \sim 5.6$\mo, and a rather low (face-on) inclination. The

considered. Since the divergences are present also in the unbroken theory, a
natural scale for the divergence formula is proposed to be at the scale of new
physics. The implications of top quark mass on the Higgs mass are investigated
by means of the renormalization group equations. The Coleman-Weinberg mechanism
for spontaneous symmetry breaking is also considered.

$\Phi _4^4$ -theory as well as QED are free in the limit where the cutoff goes
to infinity. In contrast to this, the structure of Yang-Mills theories enforces
a special choice of the Lagrangian of the $\delta $ - expansion. Together with
the change in the sign of the $\beta $ - function, this leads to a different
behavior and allows Yang-Mills theory to become non trivial.

condensate is obtained. Nevertheless, it is shown that there is no phase
transition as a function of the quark mass. It is furthermore shown that the
expansion of $\langle 0 | \overline{\psi}\psi |0\rangle$ in the gauge coupling
has zero radius of convergence but that the perturbation series is Borel
summable with finite radius of convergence. The nonanalytic behavior $\langle 0

\sqrt{G^2}$ can only be obtained by summing the perturbation series to infinite
order. The sum-rule calculation is based on masses and coupling constants
calculated from 't Hooft's solution to $QCD_{1+1}$ which employs LF
quantization and is thus based on a trivial vacuum. Nevertheless the chiral
condensate remains nonvanishing in the chiral limit which is yet another
example that seemingly trivial LF vacua are {\it not} in conflict with QCD
sum-rule results.

to be used in shell-model calculations is investigated as function of the mass
number $A$, from $A=4$ to $A=208$. As the mass number increases, there are more
intermediate states to sum over in each higher-order diagram which contributes
to the effective interaction. Together with the fact that the energy
denominators in each diagram are smaller for larger mass numbers, these two
effects could largely enhance higher-order contributions to the effective
interaction, thereby deteriorating the order-by-order convergence of the
effective interaction. This effect is counterbalanced by the short range of the
nucleon-nucleon interaction, which implies that its matrix elements are weaker
for valence single-particle states in ``large'' nuclei with large mass number
as compared to those in light nuclei. These effects are examined by comparing
various mean values of the matrix elements. It turns out that the contributions
from higher-order terms remain fairly stable as the mass number increases from
$A=4$ to $A=208$. The implications for nuclear structure calculations are
discussed.

more pronounced than in previous RQMD studies of light ion induced reactions at

enhanced by a factor of 2.4 in comparison to $pp$ results. Color rope formation
increases the initially produced antibaryons to 3 times the value in the `NN

subsequent strong absorption. The differences in the final particle composition
for Pb on Pb collisions compared to S induced reactions are attributed to the
hadronic resonance gas stage which is baryon-richer and lasts longer.
