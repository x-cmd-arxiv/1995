hypersurfaces, we characterize self-linked perfect ideals of grade 2 as those
with a Hilbert--Burch matrix that has a maximal symmetric subblock. We also
prove that every Gorenstein perfect algebra of grade 1 can be presented, as a
module, by a symmetric matrix. Both results are derived from the same
elementary lemma about symmetrizing a matrix that has, modulo a nonzerodivisor,
a symmetric syzygy matrix. In addition, we establish a correspondence, roughly
speaking, between Gorenstein perfect algebras of grade 1 that are birational
onto their image, on the one hand, and self-linked perfect ideals of grade 2
that have one of the self-linking elements contained in the second symbolic
power, on the other hand. Finally, we provide another characterization of these
ideals in terms of their symbolic Rees algebras, and we prove a criterion for
these algebras to be normal.

high galactic latitude. This survey, hereafter known as the ROSAT Deep Cluster
Survey (RDCS), is being carried out utilizing a wavelet-based detection
algorithm which, unlike other detection methods, is not biased against
extended, low surface brightness sources. It is a flux-diameter limited sample
that extends the X-ray flux limit of previous cluster surveys by more than one
order of magnitude ($F_X \ge 1\cdot 10^{-14}\rm erg\, cm^{-2}s^{-1}$). The
first results of the on-going optical follow-up program indicate a high success
rate of identification. At the present, 38 clusters out of 80 candidates have
been identified on a 26 deg$^2$ surveyed area. Recently measured redshifts
confirm the nature of these systems as low-moderate redshift groups ($z\simeq
0.2-0.3$) and intermediate to high redshift clusters ($z\simeq 0.4-0.7$). We
show X-ray and optical images of several clusters identified to date, discuss
the X-ray properties of the sample and present preliminary results on the
redshift distribution. The final sample will include $\sim 100$ clusters
covering and area of $\sim 40$ deg$^2$.

  The presentation and conclusion reflects personal view of the author that a
considerable amount of invisible energy in the universe is in the form of
vacuum energy (cosmological constant) and possibly in the form of a classical
field which adjusts vacuum energy to the value permitted and requested by

simulations to obtain various critical exponents with a high level of accuracy.

2\Delta_{0}/\pi which is independent of the masses of the polymer atoms. We
estimate effects of the electron-phonon coupling on the soliton formation
energy, particularly, through modifications of the harmonic oscillations of
(CH) groups. A model based on the amplitude mode formalism is used and the
electron-phonon coupling is taken into account to make the effective potential
of lattice vibration. Among dynamical degrees of freedom in the lattice
vibration, a translational mode of the soliton is separately examined, since it
corresponds to a zero-energy mode. We get a difference in the formation energy
between the two isotopes of about 0.03eV. Soliton trapping around defects or
impurities changes the formation energy and enlarges the isotope difference.

a soliton is induced in the electron-lattice system, the electron scattering
states both at the bottom of the valence band and the top of the conduction
band are attracted to the soliton. This attractive force induces weakly
localized electronic states at the band edges. Using the modified version of
the TLM model, we have succeeded in obtaining analytical solutions of the
weakly localized states and the extended states near the bottom of the valence
band and the top of the conduction band. This band structure does not modify
the order parameters. Our result coincides well with numerical simulation
works.

expected that this gap-fraction will fall exponentially with the gap-width,

which point it will plateau. An indication of a plateau in the measured
gap-fraction has been found, at a higher level than that expected from

(MSGM) is given. It is shown analytically that the lightest neutralino the
${{\tilde {Z}_{1}}}$ is the LSP over almost all of the parameter space, and
hence the natural candidate for cold dark matter (CDM). The radiative breaking
of $SU(2)\times U(1)$ constraints are shown to be crucial in determining the
expected event rates. Approximate analytic formulae are obtained to determine
the gaugino-higgsino content of the ${{\tilde{Z}_{1}}}$ particle.From this one
can deduce the behavior of the event rates as one varies the SUSY soft breaking
parameters and tan $\beta$. The constraint on the event rates due to the
recently measured $b\rightarrow s+\gamma$ decay is calculated. It is seen that
this data eliminates most of the parameter space where $\mu$ (the Higgs mixing
parameter) and $A_t$ (the t-quark cubic soft breaking parameter) have the same
sign. Since the t-quark is close to its Landau pole, $A_t$ is restricted to be
mostly positive, and so most of the $\mu>0$ part of the parameter space is
eliminated...
