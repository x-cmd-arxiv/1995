corona itself accretes and therefore it is powered directly by the release of
the gravitational energy and cooled by radiative interaction with the disc. We
consider the vertical structure of such a corona and show that the radial
infall is accompanied by strong vertical outflow. Such a model has two
important consequences: (i) at a given radius the corona forms only for
accretion rate larger than a limiting value and the fraction of energy
dissipated in the corona decreases with increasing accretion rate, and (ii) the
disc spectra are significantly softer in the optical/UV band in comparison with
the predictions of standard accretion discs due to the mass loss and the
decrease of internal dissipation in the disc. Both trends correspond well to
the mean spectra of radio quiet AGN and observed luminosity states in galactic
black hole candidates.

modify the main-squence time of globular cluster (GC) stars. We have calculated
the evolution of low-mass stars typical for GCs both for standard non-varying

isochrones resulting from the latter models then was chosen such that the
isochrones mimicked the standard ones at the turnoff. Assuming that the true
age of GCs is between $8$ and $20\,\rm Gyr$, and because their apparent age is
between $14$ and $18\,\rm Gyr$, we find that today $-35{\times}10^{-12}\,{\rm

time-varying $G$ as an explanation for the discrepancy between the cosmic

of liquid crystal rubber elasticity. We show that, similarly to the uniform
case, the theory is not sensitive to the molecular details of polymer liquid
crystal involved and the resulting elastic free energy is quite universal. The
result of this work is the general expression for the free energy of
deformations, which combines the effects of large non-symmetric affine strains
in the rubbery network and gradients of curvature deformations of the director
field, $F = \lambda^T (\nabla {n})^2 \lambda $. We derive the molecular
expressions for the elastic constants governing non uniform deformations in the
presence of elastic strains. They also depend on the polymer step length
anisotropy and - most strikingly - have an overall {negative} sense. We
therefore predict that in some circumstances, especially at large elastic
deformations $\lambda$, these new terms may overpower the usual, positive Frank
elastic moduli of the underlying nematic structure, as well as the coupling in
nematic elastomers of uniform relative rotations of the director and the
elastic matrix. In this event highly distorted polydomain textures n(r) would

square well in three dimensions and a delta-function residual interaction
between two weakly-bound particles at the Fermi surface. We include the
continuum by enclosing the entire system in a large spherical box. To a good
approximation, the continuum can be replaced by a small set of
optimally-determined resonance states, suggesting that in many nuclei far from
stability it may be possible to incorporate continuum effects within
traditional shell-model based approximations.

localized in both angular and radial coordinates and moving on a keplerian
orbit. The method produces a family of elliptical squeezed states for the
planar Coulomb problem that minimize appropriate uncertainty relations in
radial and angular coordinates. The time evolution of these states is studied
for orbits with different semimajor axes and eccentricities. The elliptical
squeezed states may be useful for a description of the motion of Rydberg wave
packets excited by short-pulsed lasers in the presence of external fields,
which experiments are attempting to produce. We outline an extension of the
method to include certain effects of quantum defects appearing in the
alkali-metal atoms used in experiments.

consisting of a finite union of intervals contains no eigenvalues for the
finite $N$ Gaussian Orthogonal ($\beta=1$) and Gaussian Symplectic ($\beta=4$)
Ensembles and their respective scaling limits both in the bulk and at the edge
of the spectrum. We show how these probabilities can be expressed in terms of
quantities arising in the corresponding unitary ($\beta=2$) ensembles. Our most
explicit new results concern the distribution of the largest eigenvalue in each
of these ensembles. In the edge scaling limit we show that these largest
eigenvalue distributions are given in terms of a particular Painlev\'e II
function.
