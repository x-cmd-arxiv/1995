assume that the PBH's can be highly concentrated into galaxies, thereby
weakening the Page-Hawking limit on the cosmological density of PBH's. But if
the PBH's are concentrated by a factor exceeding $c/(H_\circ R_\circ) \approx 4
\times 10^5$, where $R_\circ = 8.5$ kpc is the scale of the Milky Way, then the
steady emission from the PBH's in the halo will produce an anisotropic high
latitude diffuse gamma ray intensity larger than the observed anisotropy. This
provides a limit on the rate-density of evaporating PBH's of $\lesssim
0.4$~pc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ which is more than 6 orders of magnitude lower than
recent experimental limits. However, the weak observed anisotropic high
latitude diffuse gamma ray intensity is consistent with the idea that the dark
matter that closes the Universe is Planck mass remnants of evaporated black
holes.

with a set of data points on the southern arm published previously. We compare
these measurements on both spiral arms and on the interarm regions with
observations of the atomic and ionized hydrogen components. We determine
massive star formation efficiency parameters, defined as the ratio of H alpha
luminosity to total gas mass, along the arms and compare the values to those in
the interarm regions adjacent to the arms. We find that these parameters in the
spiral arms are on average a factor of 3 higher than outside the arms, a clear
indication of triggering of the star formation in the spiral arms. We discuss
possible mechanisms for this triggering, and conclude that a density wave
system is probably responsible for it. We discuss several possible systematical
effects in some detail, and infer that the conclusions on triggering are sound.
We specifically discuss the possible effects of extinction in H alpha, or a
non-standard CO to H_2 conversion factor (X), and find that our conclusions on
the enhancement of the efficiencies in the arms are reinforced rather than
weakened by these considerations. A simple star forming scheme involving
threshold densities for gravitational collapse is discussed for NGC 4321, and
comparison is made with M51. We find that the gas between the arms is generally
stable against gravitational collapse whereas the gas in the arms is not,
possibly leading to the observed arm-interarm differences in efficiency, but
also note that these results, unlike the others obtained in this paper, do
depend critically on the assumed value for the conversion factor.

a coordinate-system independent manner. We find the gamma-ray burst locations
to be consistent with isotropy, e.g., for the total sample the observed
Galactic dipole moment <cos theta> differs from the value predicted for
isotropy by 0.9 sigma and the observed Galactic quadrupole moment <sin^2 b -
1/3> by 0.3 sigma. We estimate for various models the anisotropies that could

spherically expanding envelope with strong mass outflow. The structure is
consistently connected to the hydrostatic stellar interior and provides an
adequate description of the outer boundary conditions for stellar models with
large mass loss rates. We apply our treatment to evolutionary models of
Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in order to study the possible influence of the stellar
winds on the interior, and to determine more reliable radii of WR stars. The
interior structure and evolution of WR stars is found to be unaffected by the
outer layers. For hydrogen rich WR stars (WNL) we find the existence of a
temperature domain in the HR-diagram, where a transient concentration of stars
on their blueward track is predicted in case of a strong backwarming from the
wind. For WNE and WC/WO stars we also derive subphotospheric radii
corresponding to Rosseland optical depths of ~ 10-20. With respect to wind-free
stellar models the subphotospheric radii are increased by up to a factor of ~ 4
for the most luminous WNE or WC stars. These radii and the corresponding
effective temperatures should roughly be comparable with the stellar parameters
of non-LTE atmosphere models of WR stars. Comparisons using the newly derived
radii yield a better agreement with observations. The stellar parameters
obtained with the new treatment allow a better assignment of theoretical
spectra to evolutionary tracks of evolved WR stars. This also provides the base
for future studies of the spectral evolution of post-MS massive stars and their
descendants. We also point out the possible importance of the iron opacity peak
for the acceleration of WR winds in the optically thick part, which may be
essential for the understanding of the dynamics of WR winds.

distortions as would derive from the chains in YBCO or superlattice effects in
BSCCO. In the orthorhombic bi-layer case the (s,-s) state is of special
interest, since for a wide range of parameters this state exhibits pi phase
shifts in corner Josephson junction experiments. In addition, its transition
temperature is found to be insensitive to non-magnetic inter-plane disorder, as
would be present at the rare earth site in YBCO, for example. Of particular
interest, also, are the role of van Hove singularities which are seen to
stabilize states with d_{x^2 - y^2}-like symmetry, (as well as nodeless
s-states) and to elongate the gap functions along the four van Hove points,
thereby leading to a substantial region of gaplessness. We find that d_{x^2 -
y^2}-like states are general solutions for repulsive interactions; they possess
the fewest number of nodes and therefore the highest transition temperatures.
In this way, they should not be specifically associated with a spin fluctuation
driven pairing mechanism.

in general relativity. It is shown that perfect fluids are a special case of
DeWitt's relativistic elastic media and that the velocity--potential formalism
for perfect fluids can be interpreted as describing a perfect fluid coupled to
a fleet of clocks. A Hamiltonian analysis of the elastic media with clocks is
carried out and the constraints that arise when the system is coupled to
gravity are studied. When the Hamiltonian constraint is resolved with respect
to the clock momentum, the resulting true Hamiltonian is found to be a
functional only of the gravitational variables. The true Hamiltonian is
explicitly displayed when the medium is dust, and is shown to depend on the
detailed construction of the clocks.

renormalization group transformation that preserves chiral symmetry the
resulting lattice action for massless fermions is chirally symmetric but
nonlocal. When the renormalization group transformation breaks chiral symmetry,
the lattice action becomes local but chiral symmetry is explicitly broken. In
particular, starting with a chiral gauge theory in the continuum one either
obtains a lattice theory which is gauge invariant but nonlocal, or a local
theory with explicitly broken gauge invariance. In both cases the spectrum of
the lattice theory is identical with the one of the continuum and the anomaly
is correctly reproduced. We also apply our techniques to vector-like theories.
In particular we propose a new renormalization group transformation for QCD and

limit and therefore no mass extrapolations are needed. Furthermore this
approach allows to write up equations relating the chiral condensate with
quantities computable by standard numerical methods, the functional form of
these relations depending on the broken symmetry group. As a check, we report
some results for the compact Schwinger model.

A characterization of these transformations is presented, which is useful to
find gauge transformations for higher-order singular lagrangians. The case of
second-order lagrangians is studied in detail. Some examples that illustrate
our results are given; in particular, for the lagrangian of a relativistic
particle with curvature, lagrangian gauge transformations are obtained, though
there are no hamiltonian gauge generators for them.

question of Monk. The paper is intended to be accessible as far as possible to
a general audience, in particular we have confined the more technical material
to a ``black box'' at the end. The proof involves a variation on Foreman and

function is studied. There exist three different physics contributions related
to flow which affect the correlation function: anisotropic source shape,
anisotropic space-momentum correlations in pion emission, and the effects
related to the HBT measurement of the size of a moving source in different
reference frames. Resolution of these contributions experimentally can lead to
a detailed understanding of both collective flow in nucleus-nucleus collisions
and the HBT technique itself. A method is presented which permits the
derivation of model independent relations between the radius of a source
measured in a frame in which it is moving and in its rest frame.
