  figures, uses psfig.sty",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present a study of low- and high-resolution ultraviolet, high-resolution
optical CAT/CES spectra and ultraviolet, optical and infrared photometry of the
peculiar supergiant HD101584. From the photometry we learn that the ultraviolet
and optical energy distribution cannot be fitted in a consistent way and we
need a model in which the UV and optical energy distribution are formed by
different gas. The Geneva photometry is best fitted to a B9II Kurucz model,
Teff=12000+-1000K and log g=3.0 +-1.0, with an extinction of E(B-V)=0.49+-0.05.
  The observed spectral features in the spectrum of HD101584 are classified in
eight different categories based on the velocity, shape of profile and the
identification. The high-excitation HeI(chi=20.87eV), NII(chi=18.40eV), CII
(chi=14.39eV) and NI (chi=10.29eV) optical absorption lines are formed in the
photosphere of a late B-star (e.g. B8-9I-II). These absorption lines show
radial velocity variations which are attributed to binary motion, with the
secondary being a white dwarf or a low-mass main sequence object. The
low-excitation P-Cygni lines in the optical and UV are formed in the wind. The
number density of absorption lines in the UV is so large that the wind spectrum
acts as an iron curtain in front of the B-star. The terminal velocity of the
wind of $v_{\infty}=100\pm30$ km~s$^{-1}~$ is consistent with the star being a
low-mass post-AGB star and the low effective gravity is attributed to the
presence of a nearby, unseen, secondary. We estimate a mass-loss rate of
\.{M}$\approx 10^{-8}$~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. Narrow absorption and emission
lines are observed which are formed in a circumsystem disk with a typical
radius of $10^{2} R_{\ast}$.

  only to wrap lines longer than 80 characters",,"10.1086/177565",,"astro-ph",,"  We calculate the damping of quadrupole f and low order g modes (primary
modes) by nonlinear coupling to other modes of the star. This damping is orders
of magnitude more rapid than direct radiative damping when the primary
amplitude is large, as in tidal capture.
  Primary modes destabilize high degree g-modes of half their frequency
(daughter modes) by 3-mode coupling in radiative zones. In sunlike stars, the
growth time $\equiv\eta^{-1}\approx 4 E_{0,42}^{-1/2}$ days, where $E_{0,42}$
is the initial energy of the primary mode in units of $10^{42}~$erg, and of
order $10^{10}E_{0,42}^{5/4}$ daughters are unstable. The growth rate is
approximately equal to the angular frequency of the primary mode times its
dimensionless radial amplitude, $\delta R/R_*\approx 0.002E_{0,42}^{1/2}$.
Although the daughter modes are limited by their own nonlinearities,
collectively they absorb most of the primary mode's energy after a time $\sim
10\eta^{-1}$ provided $E_{0}> 10^{40}~\mbox{erg}$. In fact nonlinear mode
interaction may be the dominant damping process if $E_0\gtrsim
10^{37}~\mbox{erg}$.
  Our results have application to tidally captured main sequence globular
cluster stars of mass $\ge 0.5 M_{\sun}$; the tidal energy is dissipated in the
radiative core of the star in about a month, which is less than the initial
orbital period.

luminous density distribution. The intrinsic velocity moments can be obtained
simultaneously with little extra effort. The distribution of the inner and
outer turning points of the short-axis tube orbits that are populated can be
specified freely, and is chosen in advance. The entire distribution function is
then derived from the density by an iterative scheme that starts from the
explicitly known distribution function of the thin-orbit (maximum streaming)
model, in which only the tubes with equal inner and outer turning points are
populated. The versatility and limitations of this scheme are illustrated by
the construction of a number of self-consistent three-integral flattened
isochrone models of Kuzmin--Kutuzov type, and by investigation of special cases
where the scheme is tractable analytically. This includes the behaviour of the
distribution functions in the outer regions of the models. The scheme converges
rapidly for models containing orbits with ratios of the outer to inner turning
point as large as ten, and is particularly suited for the construction of
tangentially anisotropic flattened models, self-consistent as well as
non-consistent. The algorithm simplifies in the disk and spherical limit, and
can be generalized to triaxial models.

the quantum wavefunctions of classically ergodic systems tend to the
microcanonical density on the energy shell. We here develop a semiclassical
theory that relates the rate of approach to the decay of certain classical
fluctuations. For uniformly hyperbolic systems we find that the variance of the
quantum matrix elements is proportional to the variance of the integral of the
associated classical operator over trajectory segments of length $T_H$, and
inversely proportional to $T_H^2$, where $T_H=h\bar\rho$ is the Heisenberg
time, $\bar\rho$ being the mean density of states. Since for these systems the
classical variance increases linearly with $T_H$, the variance of the matrix
elements decays like $1/T_H$. For non-hyperbolic systems, like Hamiltonians
with a mixed phase space and the stadium billiard, our results predict a slower
decay due to sticking in marginally unstable regions. Numerical computations
supporting these conclusions are presented for the bakers map and the hydrogen
atom in a magnetic field.

the subtlety of the real-time manifestation of conservation laws due to some

forming 'leptohadrons' as their color singlet bound states. There is some
evidence on the existence of leptohadrons: the production of anomalous $e^+e^-$
pairs in heavy ion collisions, Karmen anomaly, the anomalously high decay rate
of ortopositronium (Op) and anomalous production of low energy $e^+e^-$ pairs
in hadronic collisions. PCAC makes it possible to predict the couplings of
leptopion to leptons. The new contribution to Op decay rate is of correct order
of magnitude and the anomaly allows to determine the precise value of the
parameter $f_{\pi_L}$. Sigma model realization of PCAC makes it possible to
construct a model for the production of leptohadrons in the electromagnetic
fields of the colliding nuclei. $\pi_L$ develops vacuum expectation value
proportional to the 'instanton density' $E\cdot B$ and it is possible to relate
leptohadron production rates to the Fourier transform of $E\cdot B$. Anomalous
$e^+e^-$ pairs must originate from $\sigma_L \pi_L$ pairs via
$\sigma_L\rightarrow e^+e^-$ decay. The peculiar production characteristics of
leptomesons are reproduced, the order of magnitude for the production cross
section is correct and various decay rates are within experimental bounds. A
resonance in photon photon scattering at cm energy equal to leptopion mass is
predicted and leptobaryon pair production in heavy ion collisions is in
principle possible. Leptopion contribution to the $\nu-e$ and $\bar{\nu}-e$

exist not one but two theories for charged particles. In the Weinberg
construct, the boson and its antiboson carry {\it same} relative intrinsic
parity, whereas in our construct the relative intrinsic parities of the boson
and its antiboson are {\it opposite}. These results originate from the
commutativity of the operations of Charge conjugation and Parity in Weinberg's
theory, and from the anti-commutativity of the operations of Charge conjugation
and Parity in our theory. We thus claim that we have constructed a first
non-trivial quantum theory of fields for the Wigner-type particles. Second, the
massless limit of both theories seems formally identical and suggests a
fundamental modification of Maxwell equations. At its simplest level, the
modification to Maxwell equations enters via additional boundary condition(s).

frame $\ftu $,using a bounded operator $U$ on $l^2(N)$. We study the
overcompleteness of the frames in terms of properties of $U$. We also discuss
perturbation of frames in the sense that two frames are ``close'' if a certain
operator is compact. In this way we obtain an equivalence relation with the
property that members of the same equivalence class have the same
overcompleteness. On the other hand we show that perturbation in the
Paley-Wiener sense does not have this property. \\ Finally we construct a frame
which is norm-bounded below, but which does not contain a Riesz basis.The
construction is based on the delicate difference between the unconditional
convergence of the frame representation, and the fact that a convergent series
in the frame elements need not converge unconditionally.

quantum fluctuations affect ferroelectric (FE) transitions more strongly than
antiferrodistortive (AFD) ones, even though the effective mass of a single FE
local mode is larger. For SrTiO3 we find that the quantum fluctuations suppress
the FE transition completely, and reduce the AFD transition temperature from
130K to 110K. For BaTiO3, quantum fluctuations do not affect the order of the
transition, but do reduce the transition temperature by 35-50 K. The
implications of the calculations are discussed.

low-lying orbital $M1$ excitations are found in heavy deformed nuclei, arising
from the small energy separation between the two excitations with $I^{\pi}K =
2^+1$ and 1$^+1$, respectively. They are studied microscopically in QRPA using
DWBA. The accompanying $E2$ response is negligible at small momentum transfer
$q$ but contributes substantially to the cross sections measured at $\theta =
165 ^{\circ}$ for $0.6 < q_{\rm eff} < 0.9$ fm$^{-1}$ ($40 \le E_i \le 70$ MeV)
and leads to a very good agreement with experiment. The electric response is of
longitudinal $C2$ type for $\theta \le 175 ^{\circ}$ but becomes almost purely
transverse $E2$ for larger backward angles. The transverse $E2$ response
remains comparable with the $M1$ response for $q_{\rm eff} > 1.2$ fm$^{-1}$
($E_i > 100$ MeV) and even dominant for $E_i > 200$ MeV. This happens even at
large backward angles $\theta > 175 ^{\circ}$, where the $M1$ dominance is
