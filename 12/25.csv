short ($T_{90} < 10$ s) gamma-ray bursts represent distinct source populations.
Their spatial distributions are significantly different, with long bursts
having $\langle V/V_{max} \rangle = 0.282 \pm 0.014$ but short bursts having
$\langle V/V_{max} \rangle = 0.385 \pm 0.019$, differing by $0.103 \pm 0.024$,
significant at the $4.3 \sigma$ level. Long and short bursts also differ
qualitatively in their spectral behavior, with short bursts harder in the BATSE
(50--300 KeV) band, but long bursts more likely to be detected at photon
energies > 1 MeV. This implies different spatial origin and physical processes
for long and short bursts. Long bursts may be explained by accretion-induced
collapse. Short bursts require another mechanism, for which we suggest neutron
star collisions. These are capable of producing neutrino bursts as short as a
few ms, consistent with the shortest observed time scales in GRB. We briefly
investigate the parameters of clusters in which neutron star collisons may
occur, and discuss the nuclear evolution of expelled and accelerated matter.

using the Monte Carlo techniques together with restructured intermediate states
which we proposed previously.
  Our basic idea is to obtain coefficients in the expansion of the ground state
from measurements of the normalized frequencies of each state on the boundary
in the Trotter direction. The restructuring method we have proposed makes it
possible to carry out simulations within available resources of computers.
  For a concrete example we study ladder spin systems with antiferromagnetic
intra-chain nearest neighbor interactions, whose ground states may be
equivalent to that of the spin 1 chain. For the ladder with ferromagnetic rungs
we successfully show how to determine the magnitudes and relative signs of the
coefficients in the expansion. When the ladder has antiferromagnetic rungs we
examine White's claim that the diagonally situated pair of spins are mostly
triplet states in the ground state. Our results strongly suggest that the
system has the hidden order which is constructed by the specially aligned
triplet states of diagonal pairs.

theoretical analysis has shown that this picture is qualitatively correct but
there are important interference effects between the two mechanisms.
Futhermore, at this energy the ratio of strengths for the Roper and $\Delta$
peak is about $1/4$. In the present paper we show that by going to the $10 -
15$ $GeV$ region the interference effects become negligible, the signal for the
Roper excitation is increased by more than an order of magnitude and the ratio
of cross sections at the peaks for Roper and $\Delta$ excitation becomes of the
order of unity, thus making this range of energies ideal for studies of
