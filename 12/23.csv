The resulting model provides agreement with the wealth of available data,
including the spectral energy distribution in the range 0.5--1000 \mic, and
visibility and array observations. Previous conclusions about two dust shells,
derived from modelling the data with a few single-temperature components of
different radii, are not supported by our results. The extended, continuous
temperature and density distributions derived from our model obviate the need
for such discrete shells. The IR properties vary with the stellar phase,
reflecting changes in both the dust condensation radius $r_1$ and the overall
optical depth $\tau$ -- as the luminosity increases from minimum to maximum,
$r_1$ increases while $\tau$ decreases. We find that the angular size of the
dust condensation zone varies from 0.3 arcsec at minimum light to 0.5 arcsec at
maximum. The shortage of flux at short wavelengths encountered in previous
studies is resolved by employing a grain size distribution that includes grains
larger than \about\ 0.1 \mic, required also for the visibility fits. This
distribution is in agreement with the one recently proposed by Jura in a study
that probed the outer regions of the envelope. Since our constraints on the
size distribution mostly reflect the envelope's inner regions, the agreement of
these independent studies is evidence against significant changes in grain
sizes through effects like sputtering or grain growth after the initial
formation at the dust condensation zone.

properties, the angular profiles of surface brightness are self-similar. In any

depth at each wavelength and it is self-similarly scaled by the size of the

the visibility function at short wavelengths ($\la$ 2 \mic) directly determines

late-type stars. The infrared emission should display time variability because
of cyclical changes in overall optical depth, reflecting luminosity-induced

isothermal sphere and includes a core radius, $r_c$, and a power-law index,
$\eta$, defined such that mass increases as $r^\eta$ at large radius. We
approximate the galaxy cluster surrounding the lensing galaxy with a quadratic
potential described by its convergence $\kappa$ and shear $\gamma$. We fit the
model to a recent high resolution VLBI map of the two images of 0957+561. We
obtain a tight constraint on the radial index, $1.07 < \eta <1.18$, which means
that the lens galaxy is nearly isothermal with increasing mass-to-light ratio
out to $15 h^{-1}$ kpc. We also obtain an upper limit on the core radius, $r_c
< 330 h^{-1}$ pc. We use the model to calculate the Hubble constant $H_0$ as a
function of the time delay $\Delta\tau_{BA}$ between the two images: $H_0 =
\left({ 82.5^{+5.9} _{-3.0} }\right) (1 - \kappa) \left({ \Delta\tau_{BA}/1.1
\,{\rm yr} }\right)^{-1}$ km/s/Mpc. Once $\Delta \tau_{BA}$ is measured, this
will provide an upper bound on $H_0$ since $\kappa$ cannot be negative. In
addition, the model degeneracy due to $\kappa$ can be eliminated if the
one-dimensional velocity dispersion $\sigma$ of the lensing galaxy is measured.
We then have $H_0 = \left({ 82.5^{+8.7} _{-5.6} }\right) (\sigma / 322\,{\rm

  LaTex, 8 pgs",,,"POLFIS-TH/95-12","hep-th",,"  We discuss R-symmetry in locally supersymmetric $N=2$ gauge theories coupled
to hypermultiplets, which can be viewed as effective theories of heterotic
string models. In this type of supergravities a suitable R-symmetry exists and
can be used to topologically twist the theory. The vector multiplet of the
dilaton-axion field has a different R-charge assignment with respect to the
other vector multiplets.

$\lambda\varphi^4$ theory we show that spontaneous breaking of symmetry occurs
due to condensation in a coherent vacuum % which is energetically favoured
compared to the perturbative one. and leads to a vacuum energy density which is
lower than that obtained by Coleman and Weinberg using the one-loop effective
potential method. We discuss the alternative of a squeezed condensate and find
that for the massless $\lambda \varphi^4$ theory spontaneous symmetry breaking
to a squeezed vacuum does not occur.

to include explicit chiral symmetry breaking and an additional chiral invariant
term which allows for an axial coupling constant greater than unity. We also
include a chiral Lagrangian for the isotriplet vector mesons which leads to a
renormalization of the pion field. The properties of nuclear matter and nuclei,
low energy $\pi N$ scattering and the behavior of quantities such as the pion
mass and axial coupling at finite density are discussed.

$(I/c)^\delta$ where $I$ is the current through the electrochemical cell, $c$
the electrolyte concentration, and $\delta = 1.37 \pm 0.08$. Differences
between my results and the theoretical predictions suggest that
electroconvection in the electrolyte has a large influence on the instability
