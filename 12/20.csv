of complex compact manifolds~: Moishezon manifolds. In the first part, we
generalize J.-P. Demailly's holomorphic Morse inequalities to the case of a
line bundle equipped with a metric with analytic singularities on an arbitrary
compact complex manifold. Our inequalities give an estimate of the cohomology
groups with values in the line bundle tensor powers twisted by the
corresponding sequence of multiplier ideal sheaves introduced by Nadel. As a
consequence, we obtain a necessary and sufficient analytic condition, invariant
by bimeromorphism, for a manifold to be Moishezon. In the second part, we use
Mori theory to analyze the structure of Moishezon manifolds with infinite
cyclic Picard group, with big canonical bundle, and which become projective
after one single blow-up with smooth center. We study the dimension and the
structure of the center of the blow-up. In dimension four, we show that this

several hundred keV. Is this a real feature of GRBs or is it due to an
observational bias? We consider the possibility that bursts of a given
bolometric luminosity occur with a hardness distribution $p(H)d \log H \propto
H^\gamma d \log H$. We model the detection efficiency of BATSE as a function of
$H$ and calculate the expected distribution of $H$ in the observed sample for
various values of $\gamma$. We show that because the detection efficiency of
BATSE falls steeply with increasing $H$, the paucity of hard bursts need not be
real. We find that the observed sample is consistent with a distribution above
$H = 100$ keV with $\gamma \approx 0$ or even $\gamma =0.5$. Thus, a large
population of unobserved hard gamma-ray bursts may exist. It is important to
extend the present analysis to a larger sample of BATSE bursts and to include
the OSSE and COMPTEL limits. If the full sample is consistent with $\gamma\
\sgreat\ 0$, then it would be interesting to look for MeV bursts in the future.

band it detects photons from different energy bands at the source. This adds a
spectral dependence to the count distribution $N(C)$. Similarly variation of
the duration as a function of energy at the source complicates the time
dilation analysis. We describe here a new statistical formalism that performs
the required ``blue shifting"" of the count number and the burst duration in a
statistical manner. This formalism allows us to perform a combined best fit

distribution simultaneously. The outcome of this analysis is a single best fit

matter haloes to understand how their spatial distribution is biased relative
to that of the mass. The statistical distribution of dark haloes within the
initial density field (assumed Gaussian) is determined by an extension of the
Press-Schechter formalism. Modifications of this distribution caused by
gravitationally induced motions are treated using a spherical collapse
approximation. We test this model against results from a variety of N-body
simulations, and find that it gives an accurate description of a bias function.
This bias function is sufficient to calculate the cross-correlation between
dark haloes and mass, and again we find excellent agreement between simulation
results and analytic predictions. Because haloes are spatially exclusive, the
variance in the count of objects within spheres of fixed radius and overdensity
is significantly smaller than the Poisson value. This seriously complicates any
analytic calculation of the autocorrelation function of dark halos. Our
simulation results show that this autocorrelation function is proportional to
that of the mass over a wide range in $R$, even including scales where both
functions are significantly greater than unity. The constant of proportionality
is very close to that predicted on large scales by the analytic model. This
result permits an entirely analytic estimate of the autocorrelation function of
dark haloes. We use our model to study how the distribution of galaxies may be
biased with respect to that of the mass. In conjunction with other data these
techniques should make it possible to measure the amplitude of cosmic mass
fluctuations and the density of the Universe.

using molecular dynamics simulation. The network in two dimensions is subjected
to a uniform strain which drives the fracture to develop by the growth and
coalescence of the vacancy clusters in the network. For strong dilution, it has
been shown earlier that there exists a characteristic time $t_c$ at which a
dynamical transition occurs with a power law divergence (with the exponent $z$)
of the average cluster size. Close to $t_c$, the growth of the clusters is
scale-invariant in time and satisfies a dynamical scaling law. This paper shows
that the cluster growth near $t_c$ also exhibits spatial scaling in addition to
the temporal scaling. As fracture develops with time, the connectivity length
$\xi$ of the clusters increses and diverges at $t_c$ as $\xi \sim
(t_c-t)^{-\nu}$, with $\nu = 0.83 \pm 0.06$. As a result of the scale-invariant
growth, the vacancy clusters attain a fractal structure at $t_c$ with an
effective dimensionality $d_f \sim 1.85 \pm 0.05$. These values are independent
(within the limit of statistical error) of the concentration (provided it is
sufficiently high) with which the network is diluted to begin with. Moreover,
the values are very different from the corresponding values in qualitatively
similar phenomena suggesting a different universality class of the problem. The

inclusion of meson one-loop renormalization and NLO Wilson coefficients. Our
estimate is fully consistent with the $\Delta I =1/2$ selection rule in $K\to

all parameters in the allowed ranges and, in particular, taking the quark
condensate---which is the major source of uncertainty---between $(-200\ {\rm

It turns out that when correctly evaluated, the ``traditional"" CCB bounds are
very weak. I give here a brief survey of recent results on this subject, which
represent a complete analysis, showing that the new CCB bounds are very strong
and, in fact, there are extensive regions in the parameter space that become
forbidden. This produces important bounds, not only on the value of $A$, but
also on the values of $B$ and $M_{1/2}$. The form of strongest one of the new

violation can still be reconciled with the experiment if the gaugino mass,

a sufficiently small $\Delta m^2 / m^2$ at low energy. This leads to a gaugino
dominance framework (i.e. $M_{1/2}^2\gg m^2$), which permits a remarkably
model--independent analysis. We study this possibility focussing our attention
on the $\mu\rightarrow e,\gamma$ decay. In this way we obtain very strong and

plasma at zero temperature and high chemical potential to weak color

phenomena occurring in a non-Abelian plasma at high temperature and high

also possible to relate the transport equations to the zero-curvature condition
of a Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions, even when quarks are not
considered ultrarelativistic. The induced color current in the cold plasma can
be expressed as an average over angles, which represent the directions of the
velocity vectors of quarks having Fermi energy. From this color current it is
possible to compute $n$-point gluonic amplitudes, with arbitrary $n$. It is
argued that these amplitudes are the same as the ones computed in the high
chemical potential limit of QCD, that are then called hard dense loops. The
agreement between the two different formalisms is checked by computing the
polarization tensor of QED due to finite density effects in the high density
limit.

outgoing states. Modes propagating in the dynamical background of an incoming
quantum state are seen to acquire large scattering phases that nevertheless
conspire, in the absence of self-interactions, to preserve the thermality of
the Hawking radiation. However, the in-out scattering matrix does not commute
with the self-interactions and this could lead to observable corrections to the
final state. Finally, our calculations explicitly display the limited validity
of the semiclassical theory of Hawking radiation and provide support for a
formulation of black hole complementarity.

the symmetry of affine Dynkin diagrams could be extended and it leads to

interaction between the measuring instrument and the physical entity measured

and Witke (1960), Eisberg and Resnick (1985), Gasiorowicz (1974), Goswami
(1992), and Liboff (1993) supports this point. Furthermore, in line with the
view of Bohr and Feynman, generally the unavoidable interaction between a
measuring instrument and the physical entity measured is considered responsible
for the uncertainty principle. A gedankenexperiment using Feynman's double-hole
interference scenario shows that physical interaction is not necessary to
effect the change in the wave function that occurs in measurement in quantum
mechanics. Instead, the general case is that knowledge is linked to the change
in the wave function, not a physical interaction between the physical existent
measured and the measuring instrument. Empirical work on electron shelving that
involves null measurements, or what Renninger called negative observations
(Zeitschrift fur Physik, vol. 158, p. 417), supports these points. Work on
