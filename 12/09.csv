on the light-cone is evaluated in the geometrical framework of Zucchini. The
cocycles linked by the cohomology of the BRST operator to the anomaly are
straightforwardly calculated thanks to the analogy between this formulation and
the Yang-Mills theory. We give also a conformally covariant formulation of
these quantities including the anomaly, which is valid on arbitrary Riemann
surfaces. The example of the $W_3$ theory is discussed and a comparison with
other candidates for the anomaly available in the literature is presented.

quantization is the asymptotics for the Cauchy problem. Results of Berezin are
used thouroughly in the construction of the canonical operator and in proofs of
the theorems.

familiar $sl(2)$ algebra formalism. On this way a new closed analytical
expression is found for energy spectra which coincides with exact solutions in
certain cases and, in general, manifests an availability of incommensurable
eigenfrequencies related to a nearly chaotic dynamics of systems under study.

microscopically analyzed in the framework of the quasi-classical Eilenberger
equations. Selfconsistent solution for the $d$-wave pair potential is obtained
for the first time in the case of an isolated vortex. The vortex core
structure, i.e., the pair potential, the supercurrent and the magnetic field,
is found to be fourfold symmetric even in the case that the mixing of $s$-wave
component is absent. The detailed temperature dependences of these quantities
are calculated. The fourfold symmetry becomes clear when temperature is
decreased. The local density of states is calculated for the selfconsistently
obtained pair potential. From the results, we discuss the flow trajectory of
the quasiparticles around a vortex, which is characteristic in the
$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductors. The experimental relevance of our results
to high temperature superconductors is also given.
