cluster, the largest presently available for a cluster of galaxies. We have
defined a sample of cluster members complete to b$_{26.5}=20.0$, using a
membership criterion based on the galaxy velocity, when available, or on the
galaxy magnitude and colour, otherwise. Such a data set allows us to define
nearly complete samples within a region of 1~\Mpc\ radius, with a sufficient
number of galaxies per sample to make statistical analyses possible. Using this
sample and the {\em ROSAT} PSPC X--ray image of the cluster, we have
re-analyzed the structure and kinematics of Coma, by applying the wavelet and
adaptive kernel techniques. A striking coincidence of features is found in the
distributions of galaxies and hot intracluster gas. The two central dominant
galaxies, NGC4874 and NGC4889, are surrounded by two galaxy groups, mostly
populated with galaxies brighter than b$_{26.5}=17$ and well separated in
velocity space. On the contrary, the fainter galaxies tend to form a single
smooth structure with a central peak coinciding in position with a secondary
peak detected in X--rays, and located between the two dominant galaxies; we
suggest to identify this structure with the main body of the Coma cluster. A
continuous velocity gradient is found in the central distribution of these
faint galaxies, a probable signature of tidal interactions rather than
rotation. There is evidence for a bound population of bright galaxies around
other brightest cluster members. Altogether, the Coma cluster structure seems
to be better traced by the faint galaxy population, the bright galaxies being
located in subclusters. We discuss this evidence in terms of an ongoing
accretion of groups onto the cluster.

dynamical friction. Approximate analytical results are obtained for the energy
and angular momentum evolution of the orbit in the limiting cases, where the
velocity is much smaller than, and much larger than the velocity dispersion of
the gas. The general case is solved numerically. Dissipation causes a decay of
the orbit to smaller separations and orbital eccentricity increases with time.
As a binary probably spends about a few $10^6$ years embedded in the cloud,
significant evolution of the orbit is expected before the dispersal of the
cloud. Binary populations have been statistically generated and evolved for
comparison with observations of MS and PMS binaries. Dynamical friction changes
the initial frequency distribution with period of the binaries, and a maximum
is obtained in the distribution as seen observationally. Decay of the orbit due
to gas drag causes an evolution of long-period orbits to shorter periods and
thus enables the formation of close binaries.

One of the most popular classes of models involves strongly magnetized neutron

``magnetar"" models, many otherwise negligible processes can play an important
role. Here we consider the spectral effects of strong-field modifications to
Compton scattering, in particular those related to the contribution of vacuum
polarization to the dielectric tensor. Vacuum polarization introduces a
density-dependent photon frequency, called the second vacuum frequency, at
which the normal modes of polarization become nonorthogonal and the mean free
path of photons decreases sharply. Monte Carlo simulations of photon
propagation through a magnetized plasma show that this effect leads, under a
wide range of physical conditions, to a broad absorption-like feature in the
energy range $\sim$5 keV---40 keV.

these particles are almost mass degenerate with the lightest neutralino.
Unfortunately this is the case in the region where these particles are
higgsino-like. We show that, in this region, radiative corrections to the
higgsino mass splittings can be as large as the tree-level values, if the
mixing between the two stop states is large. We also show that the degree of
degeneracy of the higgsinos substantially increases if a large phase is present
in the higgsino mass term $\mu$.

conformally coupled to external metric. The only possible quantum effect is the
appearance of the conformal anomaly, which leads to the propagation of the new
degree of freedom - conformal factor. Simultaneously with the expansion of the
Universe, the scale of energies decreases and the propagating conformal factor
starts to interact with the Higgs field due to the violation of conformal
invariance in the matter fields sector. In a previous paper \cite{foo} we have
shown that this interaction can lead to special physical effects like the
renormalization group flow, which ends in some fixed point. Furthermore in the
vicinity of this fixed point there occur the first order phase transitions. In
the present paper we consider the same theory of conformal factor coupled to
Higgs field and incorporate the temperature effects. We reduce the complicated
higher-derivative operator to several ones of the standard second-derivative
form and calculate an exact effective potential with temperature on the anti de
