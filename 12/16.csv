the black hole. Then, its debris may form a precessing stream which may even
collide with itself. In order to understand the dynamical effects of the
stream-stream collision on the eventual accretion of the stellar debris onto
the black hole, we have studied how gas flow behaves when the outgoing stream
collides supersonically with the incoming stream. We have investigated the
problem analytically with one-dimensional plane-parallel streams and
numerically with more realistic three-dimensional streams. A shock formed
around the contact surface converts the bulk of the orbital streaming kinetic
energy into thermal energy. In three-dimensional simulations, the accumulated
hot post-shock gas then expands adiabatically and drives another shock into the
low density ambient region. Through this expansion, thermal energy is converted
back to the kinetic energy associated with the expanding motion. Thus, in the
end, only a small fraction of the orbital kinetic energy is actually converted
to the thermal energy, while most of it is transferred to the kinetic energy of
the expanding gas. Nevertheless the collision is effective in circularizing the
debris orbit, because the shock efficiently transforms the ordered motion of
the streams into the expanding motion in directions perpendicular to the
streams. The circularization efficiency decreases, if two colliding streams
have a large ratio of cross sections and a large density contrast. But even in
such cases, the main shock extends beyond the overlapping contact surface and
the high pressure region behind the shock keeps the stream of the larger cross
section from passing freely. Thus the stream-stream collisions are still
expected to circularize the stellar debris rather efficiently, unless the ratio

observations of the young stellar object WL16, reported in a previous
contribution to this journal, provide some of the most compelling evidence to
date for the existence of inner disks around young stars. We describe the
simple procedure that we use to synthesize bandhead emission from disks
including the effect of thermal dissociation of CO and non-LTE excitation of
the vibrational levels. Using this spectral synthesis procedure to extract the
kinematics and physical properties of the emitting gas from the overtone data,
we show how these high signal-to-noise data are also powerful probes of the
stellar and inner disk properties of these systems. Our modeling is consistent
with the identification of WL16 and 1548C27 as Herbig AeBe stars with stellar
masses of approximately 2 and 4 solar masses, respectively. Thus, the kinematic
signature of rotating disks in the overtone spectra of these sources provides
strong support for the role of accretion disks in the formation of intermediate
mass stars. For both WL16 and 1548C27, we interpret our modeling results as
indicating that the overtone emission arises from a temperature inversion
region in the inner disk atmosphere. We also find evidence for suprathermally
broadened lines and are able to place useful constraints on the radial
temperature and column density distributions of the CO line-formation region of

dressed electron and, for small velocities, show explicitly at one loop that at
the natural (on-shell) renormalisation point, $p_0=m$, ${\bold p}= m{\bold v}$,
one can renormalise the propagator multiplicatively. Furthermore the
renormalisation constants are infra-red finite. This shows that the dressing we
use corresponds to a slowly moving, physical asymptotic field.

pp\pi^0$ reaction are based on various phenomenological Lagrangians. In this
work we examine the relationship between these approaches and a systematic
chiral perturbation method. Our chiral perturbation calculation indicates that
the pion rescattering term should be significantly enhanced as compared with
the traditional phenomenological treatment, and that this term should have
substantial energy and momentum dependence. An important consequence of this
energy-momentum dependence is that, for a representative threshold kinematics
and within the framework of our semiquantitative calculation, the rescattering
term interferes destructively with the Born-term in sharp contrast to the
constructive interference obtained in the conventional treatment. This
destructive interference makes theoretical cross sections for $pp \rightarrow
pp\pi^0$ much smaller than the experimental values, a feature that suggests the
importance of the heavy-meson exchange contributions to explain the
experimental data.

non-classical states of quantised radiation is developed. It exploits the fact
that the normal ordering rule of correspondence to go from classical to quantum
dynamical variables does not in general maintain positivity. It is shown that
the approach naturally leads to distinguishing several layers of increasing
nonclassicality, with more layers as the number of modes increases. A
generalisation of the notion of subpoissonian statistics for two-mode radiation
fields is achieved by analysing completely all correlations and fluctuations in
quadratic combinations of mode annihilation and creation operators conserving
the total photon number. This generalisation is nontrivial and intrinsically
two-mode as it goes beyond all possible single mode projections of the two-mode
field. The nonclassicality of pair coherent states, squeezed vacuum and
squeezed thermal states is analysed and contrasted with one another, comparing
the generalised subpoissonian statistics with extant signatures of nonclassical
behaviour.
