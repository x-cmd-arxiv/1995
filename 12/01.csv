magnification-bias' between lensed blue and red background galaxies, arising
from a dependence of the faint galaxy count-slope on colour. The colour
distribution is skewed blueward of the far field, allowing us to measure the
cluster magnification and to understand the notorious blueness of large arcs.
We show that the magnification information can be combined with the usual image
distortion measurements to isolate the local `convergence' component of lensing
and hence derive the projected mass. This is achieved through a simple local
relation between the convergence and the observables, which can be applied
generally over the surface a cluster. In the weak lensing limit, the
convergence reduces to a dependence on the magnification alone, so that in the
outskirts of clusters the surface-density of matter is obtained directly from
the surface-density of background galaxies. Hence, useful lensing work requires
colour information but not necessarily good seeing. Interestingly, convergence
varies slowly at high redshift, saturating at a level depending on the Horizon
distance, allowing a useful model-independent measurement of the Global
Geometry.

  Lensing","11 pages, 2 figures, Submitted to: Monthly Notices of the Royal
  Astronomical Society",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Weak gravitational lensing by large scale structure affects the number counts
of faint galaxies through the ``magnification bias'' and thus affects the
measurement of the angular two-point correlation function $\w $. At faint
magnitudes the clustering amplitude will decrease differently with limiting
magnitude than expected from Limber's equation. The amplitude will hit a
minimum and then rise with limiting magnitude. This behavior occurs because
$\w$ due to clustering decreases with distance, while the ``magnification
bias'' due to weak lensing increases with distance. The apparent magnitude
$m_{min}$ at which the magnification bias starts to dominate the observed
clustering is model and color dependent. It is given by
$\omega(m=m_{min},\theta=5^\prime) \approx (1\ -\ 2)\times 10^{-3}(5s-2)^2
\Omega_0^2 \sigma_8^2$, where $s$ is the logarithmic slope of the number
counts. Already published measurements of $\w$ at $R=25$ may be strongly
influenced by the ``magnification bias''. An experiment using the ratio of blue
and red number counts across the sky can be designed such that the effects of
the ``true'' clustering is minimized. The magnification bias is a measurement
of the clustering of the mass. This weak lensing experiment does not require
measuring shapes and position angles of galaxies. I derive a revised Limber's
Equation including the effects of magnification bias.

developed and applied in the analysis of the important mean and multiple

densities and Bayes' Theorem. The posterior and predictive moments, based on a
few relatively weak assumptions, are then used to obtain maximum entropy
densities for parameters, realized error terms and future values of variables.
Posterior means for parameters and realized error terms are shown to be equal
to certain well known estimates and rationalized in terms of quadratic loss
functions. Conditional maxent posterior densities for means and regression
coefficients given scale parameters are in the normal form while scale
parameters' maxent densities are in the exponential form. Marginal densities
for individual regression coefficients, realized error terms and future values
are in the Laplace or double-exponential form with heavier tails than normal
densities with the same means and variances. It is concluded that these results
will be very useful, particularly when there is difficulty in formulating
appropriate likelihood functions and prior densities needed in traditional
maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches.

the usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently
there has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in

generalization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of
implication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique
to compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under
implication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate
for learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is
the basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between
clauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of
implication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show
that for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general
generalization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce
generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under
theta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover
we show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete

self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian. The evolution of wave packets obeying
different boundary conditions is studied and it is generally proven that all

under which the classical regime prevails, it is found that a closed universe

top quark Yukawa couplings simultaneously approach infrared fixed points; these
we analyse both algebraically and with numerical solutions of the evolution
equations at one-loop level. We identify constraints on these couplings at the
GUT scale, arising from lower limits on the top quark mass. We show that fixed
points offer a new source of bounds on RPV couplings at the electroweak scale.
We derive evolution equations for the CKM matrix, and show that RPV couplings
affect the scaling of the unitarity triangle. The fixed-point behaviour is
compatible with all present experimental constraints. However, fixed-point
values of RPV top-quark couplings would require the corresponding sleptons or

show that for curved D-branes the corresponding sector is a (partially twisted)
topological field theory. We use this result to compute the degeneracy of
2-branes wrapped around $K3$ cycles as well as 3-branes wrapped around CY
threefold vanishing 3-cycles. In both cases we find the degeneracy is in accord
with expectation. The counting of BPS states of a gas of 0-branes in the
presence of a 4-brane in $K3$ is considered and it is noted that the effective
0-brane charge is shifted by 1, due to a quantum correction. This is in accord
with string duality and the fact that left-moving ground state energy of
heterotic string starts at $-1$. We also show that all the three different
topological twistings of four dimensional $N=4$ Yang-Mills theory do arise from
curved three-branes embedded in different spaces (Calabi-Yau manifolds and

charged matter) in a ``hidden sector'' on the heterotic side. Such models are
expected to break supersymmetry through gaugino condensation in the hidden
