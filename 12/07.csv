absorption line (BAL) QSOs are either highly absorbed or underluminous in the
soft X-ray bandpass. Here, we extend this work by analyzing all known bona fide
BALQSOs observed within the inner 20' of the ROSAT PSPC. This sample includes
both targeted and serendipitous exposures ranging from 8 to 75 ksec. Despite
these deep exposures, most of the BALQSOs are undetected, and have unusually
weak X-ray emission, as evidenced by large optical-to-X-ray slopes (AOX). Large
values of AOX ($\gapprox$1.8) may prove to be a defining characteristic of
BALQSOs. We predict that samples of QSO candidates with large AOX will yield a
higher percentage of BALQSOs, particularly at low redshift. As a corollary,
X-ray-selected QSO samples should yield The optical/UV emission line spectra of
BAL and non-BAL QSOs are quite similar, suggesting that their intrinsic
spectral energy distributions are similar as well. Absorption thus seems the
likely reason for the X-ray quiet nature of BALQSOs. To constrain the total
absorbing column of the BAL clouds, we compare our measured soft X-ray fluxes
or upper limits to those expected from normal radio quiet QSOs of comparable
optical continuum magnitude and redshift. From sensitive X-ray observations, we
derive column densities of greater than about 2 times 10^22 cm-2, for intrinsic
cold absorbers of solar metallicity. These new results suggest columns {\em at

compared in the framework of galactic evolutionary models. As motivated by

We confirm that the low energy nuclei (LEN), injected in molecular clouds by
stellar winds and type II supernovae originating from the most massive
progenitors, can very naturally reproduce the observed Be and B evolution in
the early galaxy (halo phase). Assuming the global importance of the LEN
component, we compute upper and lower bounds to the neutrino process
contribution corresponding to limiting cases of LEN particle spectra. A
consistent solution is found with a spectrum of the kind proposed by Ramaty
\etal (1995a,b), e.g. flat up to $E_c=30$ MeV/n and decreasing abruptly above.
This solution fulfills the challenge of explaining at the same time the general
Be and B evolution, and their solar system abundances without overproducing
\li7 at very low metallicities, and the meteoritic \b11/\b10 ratio. In this
case, neutrino spallation is constrained to play a limited role in the genesis
of the solar system \b11. Galactic cosmic rays (GCR) become operative late in
the evolution of the disk ([Fe/H]$>$-1), but their contribution to the solar
abundances of \be9, \b10 and \b11 is not dominant (35\%, 30\% and 20\%
respectively). Thus, with this LEN spectrum, GCR are {\it not}\ the main source
of \be9 and B in the Galaxy. The most favorable case for neutrinos, (adopting
the same kind of spectrum) has $E_c=20$ MeV/n. Even in this case, the neutrino
yields of Woosley and Weaver (1995) must to be reduced by a factor of 5 to
avoid \b11 overproduction. Furthermore, this solution leads to a high B/Be

the crack is blunted, we find a small but noticeable increase in the crack
loading needed to propagate the crack. This effect may be of importance in
materials where a dislocation source near the crack tip in a brittle material
causes the crack to absorb anti-shielding dislocations, and thus cause a
blunting of the crack. It is obviously also relevant to cracks in more ductile

scatterings, and exciton/carrier-interface roughness scatterings. It has been
found that, in contrast to the free electrons/holes system in which the
carrier-carrier scattering is significant, the interface roughness scattering
is the dominant process for excitons because of the relatively small scattering
rate of exciton-carrier and exciton-exciton scatterings. This strongly affects
both the spatial motion and the energy relaxation of excitons. The spatial and
momentum distributions of excitons have been simulated up to 500 ps at several
exciton temperatures and interface roughness parameters. We have found that the

interaction potential, regarded as the kernel of an integral operator on the
Fermi surface. At the critical point, the gap function is expressed by a single
eigenfunction and no symmetry mixing is allowed. As an illustration of the
method we discuss an anisotropic tight-binding model for some classes of high
$T_c$ cuprate superconductors, exhibiting a layered structure. Some indications
on the nature of the pairing interaction emerge from a comparison of the model

derived within the framework of the theory of Special Scale-Relativity proposed
by Nottale. In particular, generalizations of the Stringy Uncertainty Principle
are obtained where the size of the strings is bounded by the Planck scale and
the size of the Universe. Based on the fractal structures inherent with two
dimensional Quantum Gravity, which has attracted considerable interest
recently, we conjecture that the underlying fundamental principle behind String
theory should be based on an extension of the Scale Relativity principle where
both dynamics as well as scales are incorporated in the same footing.

condensate formation in two-dimensional QED is studied in details. It is shown
that charge screening and confinement of fermion number in two-dimensional QED
is due to an appearance of gauge fields which nullify the Dirac determinant. An
appearance of the fields of another type but with the same property yield the
chiral condensate formation. In addition, these second type fields ensure the
""softness"" of the charge screening in a process which is analogous to the
$e^+e^-$ annihilation.

The

thirteen orders of magnitude, the scaled coupling constants are almost all {\it
natural}, being dimensionless numbers of order one. We speculate that this
result provides good evidence that QCD and chiral symmetry apply to finite
nuclei.
