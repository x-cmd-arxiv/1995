relations. We give a new algebro-geometric construction of affine and
double-affine Hecke algebras (the former is known as the Iwahori-Hecke algebra,
and the latter was introduced by Cherednik [Ch1]). More generally, to any
generalized Cartan matrix A and a point q in a 1-dimensional complex algebraic
group \c we associate an associative algebra H. If A is of finite type and
\c=C^*, the algebra H is the affine Hecke algebra of the corresponding finite
root system. If A is of affine type and \c=C^* then H is, essentially, the
Cherednik algebra. The case \c=C corresponds to `degenerate' counterparts of
the above objects cosidered by Drinfeld [Dr] and Lusztig [L2]. Finally, taking
\c to be an elliptic curve one gets some new elliptic analogues of the affine
Hecke algebra.

distribution function (PDF) for solutions of a stochastic differential
equation, such as convection equation for a passive scalar, random driven
Navier-Stokes equation etc. Existence of such tails is generally regarded as a
manifestation of intermittency phenomenon. Our formalism is based on the WKB
approximation in the functional integral for the conditional probability of
large fluctuation. We argue that the main contribution to the functional
integral is given by a coupled field-force configuration -- {\em instanton}. As
an example, we examine the correlation functions of the passive scalar $u$
advected by a large-scale velocity field $\delta$-correlated in time. We find
the instanton determining the tails of the generating functional and show that
it is different from the instanton that determines the probability distribution
function of high powers of $u$. We discuss the simplest instantons for the
Navier-Stokes equation.

clusters and from diffusion limited aggregates, epitaxially grown on metal
surfaces, is investigated theoretically. The purpose is twofold: to distinguish
compact cluster structures from diffusion limited aggregates, and to find
observable {\em signatures} that can characterize the compact clusters at the
atomic level of detail. To simplify the collision dynamics, the study is
carried out in the framework of the sudden approximation, which assumes that
momentum changes perpendicular to the surface are large compared with momentum
transfer due to surface corrugation. The diffusion limited aggregates on which
the scattering calculations were done, were generated by kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations. It is demonstrated, by focusing on the example of compact Pt
Heptamers, that signatures of structure of compact clusters may indeed be
extracted from the scattering distribution. These signatures enable both an
experimental distinction between diffusion limited aggregates and compact
clusters, and a determination of the cluster structure. The characteristics
comprising the signatures are, to varying degrees, the Rainbow, Fraunhofer,
specular and constructive interference peaks, all seen in the intensity
distribution. It is also shown, how the distribution of adsorbate heights above
the metal surface can be obtained by an analysis of the specular peak
attenuation. The results contribute to establishing He scattering as a powerful
tool in the investigation of surface disorder and epitaxial growth on surfaces,
alongside with STM.

interaction, preserve chirality. We derive the evolution equation for this case
and discuss some of the physical consequences in environments such as a

the resonance condition becomes independent of the vacuum parameters and is
approximately the same for both.

fermion theory with $N$ components of fermions for arbitrary space-time
dimensions $(2 \leq D < 4)$. We adopt the $1/N$ expansion method and calculate
the effective potential for a composite operator $\bar{\psi}\psi$. The
resulting effective potential is expanded asymptotically in terms of the
space-time curvature $R$ by using the Riemann normal coordinate. We assume that
the space-time curves slowly and keep only terms independent of $R$ and terms
linear in $R$. Evaluating the effective potential it is found that the
first-order phase transition is caused and the broken chiral symmetry is
restored for a large positive curvature. In the space-time with a negative
curvature the chiral symmetry is broken down even if the coupling constant of
the four-fermion interaction is sufficiently small. We present the behavior of
the dynamically generated fermion mass. The critical curvature, $R_{cr}$, which
divides the symmetric and asymmetric phases is obtained analytically as a
function of the space-time dimension $D$. At the four-dimensional limit our
result $R_{cr}$ agrees with the exact results known in de Sitter space and
Einstein universe.
