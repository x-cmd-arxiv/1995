understand these screening effects. We study electron screening effects in the
low-energy collisions of Z=1 nuclei with hydrogen molecules. Our model is based
on a dynamical evolution of the electron wavefunctions within the TDHF scheme,
while the motion of the nuclei is treated classically. We find that at the
currently accessible energies the screening effects depend strongly on the
molecular orientation. The screening is found to be larger for molecular
targets than for atomic targets, due to the reflection symmetry in the latter.
The results agree fairly well with data measured for deuteron collisions on
molecular deuterium and tritium targets.

the fact that in Bohmian mechanics there is no back action of particle

careful consideration of the meaning of the wave function in quantum mechanics,
as suggested by a Bohmian perspective. We propose that the reason, on the
universal level, that there is no action of configurations upon wave functions,
as there seems to be between all other elements of physical reality, is that
the wave function of the universe is not an element of physical reality. We
propose that the wave function belongs to an altogether different category of
existence than that of substantive physical entities, and that its existence is
nomological rather than material. We propose, in other words, that the wave
function is a component of physical law rather than of the reality described by
