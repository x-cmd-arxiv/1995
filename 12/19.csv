The implied white dwarf mass is 0.90 +- 0.12 Msun, considerably above the
median mass (~0.6 Msun) of single white dwarfs. The parameters of the white
dwarf in HR 3643 are not well constrained, mainly due to a large uncertainty in
the distance. By assuming a reasonable range of gravity for the white dwarf
(7.3 < log g < 9.0), we derive -1.4 < Mv < 0.6 for the F7 II star, and 28,970 <
Teff < 35,990 K for the white dwarf. Prompted by our detection of a white dwarf
companion of a luminous F star, we have examined the IUE archives to assess the
upper limits on possible white dwarf companions to Cepheids. The detection of a
Cepheid -- white dwarf binary would provide important insights concerning the
most massive progenitors of white dwarfs. Only for the cases of Alp UMi and

observations in low mass red giants. (This trend is opposite to what is
expected from standard first dredge-up.) Our models assume that extra mixing
always reaches to the same distance in temperature from the H-burning shell,
and that CBP begins when the H-burning shell erases the molecular weight
discontinuity (""mu-barrier"") established by first dredge-up. For Pop I stars,
none of the other CNO isotopes except N-15 are expected to be altered by CBP.
(If O-18 depletion occurs on the AGB, as some observations suggest, it would
require that extra mixing reach closer to the H-burning shell on the AGB than
on the RGB --- and should also result in a much lower C-12/C-13 ratio than is
observed.) CBP increases as one reduces the stellar mass or metallicity ---
roughly as 1/M^2 on the RGB, due to the longer RGB of low mass stars, and as
1/Z, due to higher H-shell burning temperatures at low metallicity. In low mass
Pop II stars, all the CNO isotopes are expected to be altered by CBP. Field Pop
II stars exhibit RGB abundances consistent with the predictions of our CBP

stars, via the Cameron-Fowler mechanism, due to extra deep mixing and the
associated ""cool bottom processing"" (CBP). Under certain conditions, this Li-7
creation can take the place of the Li-7 destruction normally expected. Note
that such extra mixing on the red giant branch (RGB) has previously been
invoked to explain the observed C-13 enhancements. This new Li-7 production can
account for the recent discovery of surprisingly high lithium abundances in
some low mass red giants (a few of which are super-rich lithium stars, with
abundances higher than that in the interstellar medium). The amount of Li-7
produced can exceed log epsilon(Li-7) = 4, but depends critically on the
details of the extra mixing mechanism (mixing speeds, geometry, episodicity).
If the deep circulation is a relatively long-lived, continuous process,
lithium-rich RGB stars should be completely devoid of beryllium and boron. CBP
also leads to He-3 destruction in low mass stars; in contrast to Li-7 creation,
the extent of He-3 depletion is largely independent of the details of the extra
mixing mechanism. The overall contribution from solar-metallicity stars (1 - 40
Msun) is expected to be net destruction of He-3, with overall He-3 survival
fraction g_3 = 0.9 +/- 0.2 (weighted average) --- in contrast to standard
dredge-up, which would predict stars are net producers of He-3 (g_3:dr = 2.4
+/- 0.5). Pop II stars experience even more severe He-3 depletion, with 0.3 <
g_3 < 0.7. Destruction of He-3 in low mass stars is consistent with the
requirements of galactic chemical evolution models; it would also result in
some relaxation of the upper bound on the primordial (D + He-3)/H abundance.

in which disk galaxies form by continuous cooling and accretion of gas within a
merging hierarchy of dark matter halos. A simple Kennicutt law of star
formation for disks, based on a single- fluid gravitational instability model
is introduced. Since the gas supply in the disk is regulated by infall from the
surrounding halo, the gas is always maintained at a critical threshold surface
density. Chemical enrichment of the disks occurs when the surrounding hot halo
gas is enriched with heavy elements ejected during surpernova explosions. This
gas then cools onto the disk producing a new generation of metal-rich stars.
  I first show that models of this type can reproduce many of the observed
properties of a typical spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, including its gas and
stellar surface density profiles and the observed relationship between the ages
and metallicities of solar neighbourhood stars. I then use the models to make
inferences about the properties of disk galaxies at high redshift. The total
neutral hydrogen density Omega(HI) increases at higher z. The predicted
increase is mild, but is roughly consistent with the latest derivation of
Omega(HI) as a function of z by Storrie-Lombardi & MacMahon (1995). The models
are also able to account for some of the other trends other trends seen in the
high-redshift data, including the increase in the number of high column-density
systems at high redshift, as well as the metallicity distribution of damped
Lyman-alpha systems at redshifts 2-3.

lattice gauge theory and in the continuum theory. From a simple topological
consideration, instantons are expected to live only around the QCD-monopole
trajectory in the abelian gauge. First, the instanton solution is analytically
studied in the Polyakov-like gauge, where $A_4(x)$ is diagonalized. The world
line of the QCD-monopole is found to be penetrate the center of each instanton
inevitably. For the single-instanton solution, the QCD-monopole trajectory
becomes a simple straight line. On the other hand, in the multi-instanton
system, the QCD-monopole trajectory often has complicated topology including a
loop or a folded structure, and is unstable against a small fluctuation of the
location and the size of instantons. We also study the thermal instanton system
in the Polyakov-like gauge. At the high-temperature limit, the monopole
trajectory becomes straight lines in the temporal direction. The topology of
the QCD-monopole trajectory is drastically changed at a high temperature.
Second, the correlation between instantons and QCD-monopoles is studied in the
maximally abelian (MA) gauge and/or the Polyakov gauge using the SU(2) lattice
with $16^4$. The abelian link variable $u_\mu (s)$ is decomposed into the
singular (monopole-dominating) part $u_\mu ^{Ds}(s)$ and the regular
(photon-dominating) part $u_\mu ^{Ph}(s)$. The instanton numbers, $Q({\rm Ds})$
and $Q({\rm Ph})$, are measured using the SU(2) variables, $U_\mu ^{Ds}(s)$ and
$U_\mu ^{Ph}(s)$, which are reconstructed by multiplying the off-diagonal

We show that at the $c$ and $b$ quark mass scales the $1/m$-expansion does not
converge for these quarkonia channels, while a connection of our mass and width
formulae, with the potential model ones is done. Using the present value of the
QCD coupling $\alpha_s$, we deduce the value: $<\alpha_s G^2> = (7.5\pm
2.5)\times 10^{-2}$ GeV$^4$ of the gluon condensate from $M_\psi - M_{\eta_c}$
and $M_{\chi_b} - M_\Upsilon$, which we compare with the ones from different
fits of the heavy and light quark channels. We also find that
$M_{\chi_c(P^1_1)} - M_{\chi_c(P^3_1)}$ is gouverned by the radiative
corrections and gives $\alpha_s$(1.3 GeV) = 0.64$^{+0.36}_{-0.18}$ for 4

  from suganuma@miho.rcnp.osaka-u.ac.jp )",,,,"hep-th",,"  Correlation between instantons and QCD-monopoles is studied in the
abelian-gauge-fixed QCD. From a simple topological consideration, instantons
are expected to appear only around the QCD-monopole trajectory in the
abelian-dominating system. The QCD-monopole in the multi-instanton solution is
studied in the Polyakov-like gauge, where $A_4(x)$ is diagonalized. The world
line of the QCD-monopole is found to be penetrate the center of each instanton.
For the single-instanton solution, the QCD-monopole trajectory becomes a simple
straight line. On the other hand, in the multi-instanton system, the
QCD-monopole trajectory often has complicated topology including a loop or a
folded structure, and is unstable against a small fluctuation of the location
and the size of instantons. We also study the thermal instanton system in the
Polyakov-like gauge. At the high-temperature limit, the monopole trajectory
becomes straight lines in the temporal direction. The topology of the
QCD-monopole trajectory is drastically changed at a high temperature.

gauges are not admissible in the path integral for parametrized systems. This
is the case for the relativistic particle and gravitation. However, a time
dependent canonical transformation can turn a parametrized system into an
ordinary gauge system. It is shown how to build a canonical transformation such
that the fixation of the new coordinates is equivalent to the fixation of the
original ones; this aim can be achieved only if the Hamiltonian constraint
allows for an intrinsic global time. Thus the resulting action, describing an
ordinary gauge system and allowing for canonical gauges, can be used in the
path integral for the quantum propagator associated with the original

assumes that the colliding hadrons become color charged because of gluon

recede. The strong chromoelectric field inside this tube creates quark pairs
(including charmed ones) and the ensuing color screening breaks the tube into
excited hadronic clusters. On their turn these clusters, or `fireballs', decay
statistically into the final hadrons. The model is able to account for the soft
production of charmed, strange and lighter hadrons within a unified framework.

by non-critical string theory, trigger then an {\em organized collapse} of the
coherent states down to a specific or {\em conscious state}. The whole process
we estimate to take ${\cal O}(1\,{\rm sec})$. The {\em microscopic arrow of

self-collapse process, provides a satisfactory and simple resolution to the
age-old problem of how the, central to our feelings of awareness, sensation of
the progression of time is generated. In addition, the complete integrability
of the stringy model for MT we advocate in this work proves sufficient in
providing a satisfactory solution to memory coding and capacity. Such features
