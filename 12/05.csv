that the initial disc mass controls the evolution of the star-disc system. For
sufficiently massive discs, a stellar field of $\sim$ 1 kG is able to regulate
the spin rate to the observed values during the classical T Tauri phase. The
field then acts to expel the disc and the star spins up at constant angular
momentum as a weak-line system. Lower mass discs are ejected at an early epoch
and fail to brake the star significantly. We extend the model to close binary
systems, and find that the removal of angular momentum from the disc by the

therefore be relatively slow rotators. We also discuss the implications of our

  Notices",,"10.1093/mnras/280.1.227",,"astro-ph",,"  The ``low'' (hard or ``non-thermal'') state of black hole candidates is
sometimes modelled via an optically thick, hot Compton cloud that obscures a
softer input source such as an accretion disk. In these models the observed
output spectra consist entirely of photons reprocessed by the cloud, making it
difficult to extract information about the input spectra. Recently Miller
(1995) has argued that the Fourier phase (or time) lag between hard and soft
X-ray photons in actuality represents the phase lags intrinsic to the input
source, modulo a multiplicative factor. The phase lags thus would be a probe of
the input photon source. In this paper we examine this claim and find that,
although true for the limited parameter space considered by Miller, the
intrinsic phase lag disappears whenever the output photon energy is much
greater than the input photon energy. The remaining time lags represent a
``shelf'' due to differences between mean diffusion times across the cloud. As
pointed out by Miller, the amplitude of this shelf -- which is present even
when the intrinsic time lags remain -- is indicative of the size and
temperature of the Compton cloud and is a function of the two energies being
compared. However, we find that with previous instruments such as Ginga the
shelf, if present, was likely obscured by counting noise. A more sensitive
measure of Compton cloud parameters may be obtainable from the coherence
function, which is derived from the amplitude of the Fourier cross power
spectral density. This function has been seen to exponentially decrease at high
Fourier frequencies in Cygnus X-1. Coherence loss is characteristic of Compton
clouds that undergo large variations of size and/or temperature on time scales

quasars tend to have large Doppler factors, and BL Lacertae objects span the
full range of Doppler factors. These results support the ""orientation unified

combining equipartition Doppler factors and apparent velocities from
superluminal motion studies. There are 43 sources for which apparent speeds and
equipartition Doppler factors are available. The bulk Lorentz factor and
outflow angle are estimated for each of these 43 sources. Again, typical
parameter values for different categories of AGN are quite interesting, and
generally agree with expectations based on the orientation unified model.

renormalization of the coupling $U$ as a function of three energy-momenta. We
calculate the intrinsic scale $T_{co}$ where the renormalization group flow
crosses over from the regime ($\Lambda > T_{co}$) where the electron-electron
(e-e) and electron-hole (e-h) terms are equally important to the regime
($\Lambda < T_{co}$) where only the e-e term plays a role. In the low energy
regime only the pairing interaction $V$ is marginally relevant, containing
contributions from all renormalization group steps of the regime $\Lambda >

both sides of the transition. The localization phenomenon apparently is
decoupled from the distribution of eigenfrequencies since the spectrum changes
from continuous to Cantor-set-like when the interaction parameters are varied

matrix elements in powers of $M_H^2/v^2$ can be greatly simplified in the limit
$M_H^2\gg M_W^2,\, M_Z^2$ through the use of the Goldstone boson equivalence
theorem. This theorem allows the vector bosons $W^\pm$ and $Z$ to be replaced
by the associated scalar Goldstone bosons $w^\pm$, $z$ which appear in the
symmetry breaking sector of the Standard Model in the limit of vanishing gauge
couplings. In the present paper, we extend the equivalence theorem
systematically to include the Yukawa interactions between the fermions and the
Higgs and Goldstone bosons of the Standard Model. The corresponding Lagrangian
${\cal L}_{EQT}$ is given, and is formally renormalized to all orders. The
renormalization conditions are formulated both to make connection with physical
observables and to satisfy the requirements underlying the equivalence theorem.
As an application of this framework, we calculate the dominant radiative
corrections to fermionic Higgs decays at one loop including the virtual effects
of a heavy top quark. We apply the result to the decays $H\rightarrow t\bar{t}$

MSSM at $m_t\sim 175$ GeV for $\alpha_s(M_Z^2)=0.118$ and at $m_t \sim 180$ GeV
for more generous values $\sim (0.130)$ of $\alpha_s$; and between the SM and
the Minimal plus Singlet Susy Model [(M+1)SSM] if the independent scalar
self--coupling of the latter is perturbatively small or if the $\tan\beta$
parameter is large; these gaps widen with increasing $m_t$; (ii) the mass gap
emerges with $m_t$ 10 GeV lighter if only vacuum stability and not
metastability is imposed; (iii) there is no overlap between the SM and the MSSM
bounds at even smaller values of $m_t$ for the $\tan\beta$ value ($\sim 1$--2)

the supersymmetry properties of the solutions by calculating the eigenvalues of
