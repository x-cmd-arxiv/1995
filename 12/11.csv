function (LF) as a function of redshift and star formation activity from z=0 to
z=0.75. The dataset used for this purpose is a combined sample of over 1700
redshifts spanning a wide range in apparent magnitude, 11.5<B<24.0, which we
term the Autofib Redshift Survey. The sample includes various earlier
magnitude-limited surveys constructed by our team as well as a new survey of
1026 redshifts measured for galaxies at intermediate magnitudes. The large
range in apparent magnitude sampled allows us to investigate both the nature of
the LF at low redshift (z<0.1) and possible evolution in its shape to z=0.75.
We find that earlier bright surveys have underestimated the absolute
normalisation of the LF. Because the shape of the local LF does not change with
the survey apparent magnitude limit, it seems unlikely that the local
deficiency arises from an underestimated population of low luminosity galaxies.
Furthermore, surface brightness losses cannot be significant unless they
conspire to retain the LF shape over a variety of detection thresholds. Our
data directly demonstrates that the B-band LF evolves with redshift. This
evolution is best represented as a steepening of the faint-end slope of the LF,
from alpha=-1.1 at low redshift to alpha=-1.5 at z=0.5. Using [OII] emission as
an indicator of star formation activity, we show that the LF of quiescent
galaxies has remained largely unchanged since z=0.5, whereas the luminosity
density of star-forming galaxies has declined by nearly a factor of 2. The
steepening of the overall LF with lookback time is a direct consequence of the
increasing space density of blue star-forming galaxies at moderate redshifts.

almost exclusively in distant clusters is frequently used to link them to the
``Butcher-Oemler effect'' and to argue that cluster environment influences
galaxy evolution. From 11113 spectra in the Las Campanas Redshift Survey, we
have obtained a unique sample of 21 nearby ``E+A"" galaxies. Surprisingly, a
large fraction (about 75%) of these ``E+A''s lie in the field. Therefore,
interactions with the cluster environment, in the form of the ICM or cluster
potential, are not essential for ``E+A'' formation. If one mechanism is
responsible for ``E+A''s, their existence in the field and the tidal features
in at least 5 of the 21 argue that galaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers are
that mechanism. The most likely environments for such interactions are poor
groups, which have lower velocity dispersions than clusters and higher galaxy
densities than the field. In hierarchical models, groups fall into clusters in
greater numbers at intermediate redshifts than they do today. Thus, the
Butcher-Oemler effect may reflect the typical evolution of galaxies in groups
and in the field rather than the influence of clusters on star formation in
galaxies. This abstract is abridged.

acids is addressed. A statistical analysis is performed in terms of blocked and
random walk values formed by binary hydrophobic assignments of the amino acids
along the protein chains. Theoretical expectations of these variables from
random distributions of hydrophobicities are compared with those obtained from
functional proteins. The results, which are based upon proteins in the
SWISS-PROT data base, convincingly show that the amino acid sequences in
proteins differ from what is expected from random sequences in a statistical
significant way. By performing Fourier transforms on the random walks one
obtains additional evidence for non-randomness of the distributions.
  We have also analyzed results from a synthetic model containing only two
amino-acid types, hydrophobic and hydrophilic. With reasonable criteria on good
folding properties in terms of thermodynamical and kinetic behavior, sequences
that fold well are isolated. Performing the same statistical analysis on the
sequences that fold well indicates similar deviations from randomness as for
the functional proteins. The deviations from randomness can be interpreted as
originating from anticorrelations in terms of an Ising spin model for the
hydrophobicities.
  Our results, which differ from previous investigations using other methods,
might have impact on how permissive with respect to sequence specificity the
protein folding process is -- only sequences with non-random hydrophobicity
distributions fold well. Other distributions give rise to energy landscapes
with poor folding properties and hence did not survive the evolution.

gives acceptable charged fermion and neutrino masses within the context of a
phenomenological fit to the low energy standard model inputs. Despite a
complicated Higgs sector, the SO(10) $\underline{10}$ Higgs superfield mass
insertion is found to be the sole contribution to the tree level F-term
governing nucleon decay. The resulting dimension 5 operators that mediate
nucleon decay give branching ratio predictions parameterised by a single
parameter, the ratio of the Yukawa couplings of the $\underline{10}$ to the
fermion generations. For parameter values corresponding to a lack of dominance
of the third family self coupling, the dominant nucleon decay modes are $p

\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$, as expected. Further, the charged muon decay modes are
enhanced by two orders of magnitude over the standard minimal SUSY SU(5)
predictions, thus predicting a distinct spectrum of `visible' modes. These
charged muon decay modes, along with $p \rightarrow \pi^{+} + \bar{\nu}_{\mu}$

over the SUSY SU(5) prediction, suggest a distinguishing fingerprint of this

the hard photon-gluon cross section $\gg_{\rm hard}(x)$ in polarized deep
inelastic scattering calculated in the gauge-invariant factorization scheme
does {\it not} involve any soft contributions and hence it is genuinely {\it
hard}. We show that the polarized proton structure function $g_1^p(x)$ up to
the next-to-leading order of $\alpha_s$ is independent of the factorization
convention, e.g., the gauge-invariant or chiral-invariant scheme, chosen in
defining $\gg_{\rm hard}(x)$ and the quark spin density. Thereby, it is not
pertinent to keep disputing which factorization prescription is correct or
superior. The hard-gluonic contribution to $\Gamma_1^p$, the first moment of
$g_1^p(x)$, is purely factorization dependent. Nevertheless, we stress that
even though hard gluons do not contribute to $\Gamma_1^p$ in the
gauge-invariant scheme, the gluon spin component in a proton, which is
factorization independent, should be large enough to perturbatively generate a
negative sea polarization via the axial anomaly. We briefly comment on how to
study the $Q^2$ evolution of parton spin distributions to the next-to-leading
order of QCD in the chiral-invariant factorization scheme.

in the framework of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The first, chiral symmetry,
received its fundamental justification from QCD and has been developed into the
powerful technique of chiral perturbation theory. The other notion is the
large-$N_c$ limit, namely the behavior of QCD in the limit where there are a
large number of colors. Like chiral symmetry, the large-$N_c$ limit predicts
many relations between baryon matrix elements. These so-called
``model-independent'' predictions should agree with each other, but
paradoxically that is not always the case. The paradox is resolved by
recognizing that the two limiting processes (large-$N_c$ and the chiral limit)
do not commute. This noncommutivity can be traced to the special role played by
the $\Delta$ resonance in large-$N_c$ QCD. This gives rise to a new parameter
in the effective theory of baryons.

A","Phys.Rev.A53:53-65,1996","10.1103/PhysRevA.53.53",,"quant-ph",,"  The projection postulate has been used to predict a slow-down of the time
evolution of the state of a system under rapidly repeated measurements, and
ultimately a freezing of the state. To test this so-called quantum Zeno effect
an experiment was performed by Itano et al. (Phys. Rev. A 41, 2295 (1990)) in
which an atomic-level measurement was realized by means of a short laser pulse.
The relevance of the results has given rise to controversies in the literature.
In particular the projection postulate and its applicability in this experiment
have been cast into doubt. In this paper we show analytically that for a wide
range of parameters such a short laser pulse acts as an effective level
measurement to which the usual projection postulate applies with high accuracy.
The corrections to the ideal reductions and their accumulation over n pulses
are calculated. Our conclusion is that the projection postulate is an excellent
pragmatic tool for a quick and simple understanding of the slow-down of time
evolution in experiments of this type. However, corrections have to be
included, and an actual freezing does not seem possible because of the finite
duration of measurements.
