general type, is constructed and briefly discussed in relation with arithmetic
conjectures of Harris, Lang and Manin. Existence of the Lang map follows from
the additivity of Kodaira dimension, but the fine structure depends on
conjectures on birational classification of algebraic varieties. Serious
applications of the Lang map are still being searched.

significant improvements over other methods in higher spatial resolution,
greater sensitivity to faint sources, and immunity to the production of
spurious artifacts and signal-correlated residuals. The same technique may be
used for those problems of large-scale structure which allow for variable
smoothing. The comparison of different datasets is not impaired by the variable
smoothing, because a common underlying density/potential field, whatever its
smoothing, can be applied to all datasets. By making optimal use of the
combined datasets, the pixon method could therefore yield the most sensitive
determination of the cosmological density parameter, $\Omega$, from redshift
and velocity surveys.

three years. A rest-frame structure function analysis shows an increase of
variability with the time interval up to 0.2 mag r.m.s. after two years. A
comparison with the IUE data available for PG quasars shows that the
variability increases with the rest-frame frequency at each time interval.
Evidence for this effect is supported by the analysis of the average
variability of other published quasar samples. The effect can completely
account for the increase of variability with redshift found in other studies.

an isotropic fluid phase. In a mesophase of achiral molecules the fluctuations
will on average be achiral as well: left-handed twists and right-handed twists
will occur with the same probability. In a system composed of chiral molecules,
however, the fluctuations will be biased in one direction or the other, and
there will be optical effects such as a non-zero fluctuation induced rotary
power {\sl in addition} to the molecular rotary power of the individual
molecules. We discuss this effect in a number of contexts, including lyotropic
lamellar phases. When the tendency to twist is strong enough or the line energy
of having an exposed edge is small enough, a new, defect riddled ground state
of a lyotropic lamella, akin to the Renn-Lubensky twist-grain-boundary phase of
thermotropic smectics, can occur.

importance for analysing exclusive weak decays. The ratios of different form
factors of a given process depend on the relativistic spin structure of initial

spectator particle --- that these ratios can entirely be expresssed in terms of
particle and quark mass parameters. For quark masses large compared to the
spectator mass the Isgur-Wise relations follow. The corresponding amplitudes
for heavy-to-light transitions show a very similar structure. In particular,
the $F_0$ and $A_1$ form factors behave again differently from the $F_1, A_2,

Calculations show that the presence of the field affects absolute values of the

the overall effect depends upon the relative orientation between the field and
the nuclear motion. Other features of a null-field situation, such as scaling
laws, are revisited.

the adjoint representation $\ad$ of $\fu$ in the simplest case of the root

in the study of local systems of conformal blocks in WZW model for $\hat{sl}_2$

part is closely related to the problem of integral representation of conformal
blocks (see [BFS]). We find all the indecomposable direct summands of $\ad$
with multiplicities. It appears that $\ad$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of
simple and projective modules. It can be lifted to a module over the (infinite
dimensional) quantum universal enveloping algebra with divided powers
$U_q(sl_2)$ which is also a direct sum of simples and projectives.
