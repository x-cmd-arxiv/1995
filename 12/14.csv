turbulent stresses in the convection zone. The surface velocity amplitude of
low degree and low order g-modes resulting from this process is estimated to be
of order 10$^{-2}$ cm s$^{-1}$. This amplitude is interestingly close to the

the radio luminosities of AGN, which improves upon the usual [OIII]/radio
correlations. Taking mass and energy conservation in the jet/disk system into
account we can successfully model the correlation for radio-loud and radio-weak
quasars. We find that jets are comparable in power to the accretion disk
luminosity, and the difference between radio-loud and radio-weak may correspond
to two natural stages of the relativistic electron distribution -- assuming
that radio weak quasars have jets as well. The distribution of flat- and
steep-spectrum sources is explained by bulk Lorentz factors gamma_j ~ 5-10. The
absence of radio-loud quasars below a critical optical luminosity coincides
with the FR I/FR II break and could be explained by a powerdependent,
``closing'' torus. This points towards a different type of obscuring torus in
radio-loud host galaxies which might be a consequence of past mergers (e.g. by
the temporary formation of a binary black-hole). Interaction of the jet with
the closing torus might in principle also help to make a jet radio-loud.
Turning to stellar-mass black holes we find that galactic jet sources can be
described with the same coupled jet/disk model as AGN which is suggestive of
some kind of universal coupling between jet and accretion disk around compact
objects.

to recover $\kappa$ {}from shear estimates on a finite region and compare how

here are divided into 2 classes: direct reconstruction and regularized
inversion. Direct reconstruction techniques express $\kappa$ as a 2D integral
of the shear field. This yields an estimator for $\kappa$ as a discrete sum
over background galaxy ellipticities which is straightforward to implement, and
allows a simple estimate of the noise. We study 3 types of direct
reconstruction methods: 1) $\kappa$-estimators that measure the surface density
at any given target point relative to the mean value in a reference region 2) a
method that explicitly attempts to minimize the rotational part of $\nabla
\kappa$ that is due to noise and 3) a novel, exact Fourier-space inverse
gradient operator. We also develop two `regularized maximum likelihood'
methods, one of which employs the conventional discrete Laplacian operator as a
regularizer and the other uses regularization of all components in Fourier
space. We compare the performance of all the estimators by means of simulations
and noise power analysis. A general feature of these unbiased methods is an
enhancement of the low frequency power which, for some of the methods, can be
quite severe. We find the best performance is provided by the maximum
likelihood method with Fourier space regularization although some of the other
methods perform almost as well.

nearly no effects on the thermal and viscous modes. The including of thermal
diffusion, however, tends to stabilize the acoustic modes which, if without
advection, are unstable if the disk is optically thick, radiation pressure
dominated or optically thin, and are stable if the disk is optically thick, gas
pressure dominated. The including of very little advection has significant
effects on two acoustic modes. Independent on the optical depth, the
instability of the outward propagating mode (O-mode) is enhanced and that of
the inward propagating mode (I-mode) is damped if the disk is gas pressure
dominated, while the instability of O-mode is damped and that of I-mode is
enhanced if the disk is radiation pressure dominated. For a geometrically slim,
advection-dominated disk, both the thermal and viscous modes, as well as
I-mode, are always stable if the disk is optically thin. The including of
thermal diffusion tends to make these modes more stable. However, the O-mode
can become unstable when $q/m$ is very large ($q$ is the ratio of advective to
viscous dissipated energy and $m$ the Mach number), even if the thermal
diffusion is considered. On the other hand, if the advection-dominated disk is

equipped with different vacuum states. For example the Sine-Gordon- and the
$\phi^4_2$-model. It is known that in these models there are also states,
called soliton- or kink-states, which interpolate different vacua. We consider
the following question: Which are the properties a pair of vacuum sates must
have, such that an interpolating kink-state can be constructed? Since we are
interested in structural aspects and not in specific details of a given model,
we are going to discuss this question in the framework of algebraic quantum
field theory which includes, for example, the $P(\phi)_2$-models. We have shown
that for a large class of vacuum states, including the vacua of the
$P(\phi)_2$-models, there is a natural way to construct an interpolating
kink-state.

We show that the set of all invertible inner functions in $E$ is the set of all

nucleon excitation spectrum. We find that for $q\lsim 1$ GeV the elastic and
inelastic nucleon contributions to the nuclear response functions are
comparable, and can be separated, but with roughly a factor of two uncertainty
in the latter from the extrapolation from data. In contrast, for $q\rsim 2$ GeV
this uncertainty is greatly reduced but the elastic nucleon contribution is
heavily dominated by the inelastic nucleon background.

completely solving the equation of motion. The equivalent quantum action
variable appearing in the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, can, analogously
provide the energy eigenvalues of a bound state problem, without having to
solve the corresponding Schr\""odinger equation explicitly. This elegant and
useful method is elucidated here in the context of some known and not so well
known solvable potentials. It is also shown, how this method provides an
understanding, as to why approximate quantization schemes such as ordinary and
supersymmetric WKB, can give exact answers for certain potentials.

above scheme with a similar, but {\it exact} quantization condition, $\oint_c

formalism reveals that, the locations and the residues of the poles that

these poles completely determine the eigenvalues in these two cases, the
exactness of the SWKB for these potentials is accounted for. Three non-exact
cases are also analysed; the origin of this non-exactness is shown to be due
the presence of additional singularities in $\sqrt{E-\omega^2(x)}$, like branch
cuts in the $x-$plane.

finite size scaling that for samples with disorder the critical temperature Tp
for the c axis resistivity corresponds to a percolation phase transition of
vortex lines perpendicularly to the applied field. The value of Tp is higher
than the critical temperature for j perpendicular to H, but decreases with the
thickness of the sample and with anisotropy. We predict that critical behavior
around Tp should reflect in experimentally accessible quantities, as the I-V
