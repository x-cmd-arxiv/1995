emission above $\sim$ 10 keV. In the {\em high state}, in which 2 -- 10 keV
luminosity is relatively high, the energy index of the hard X-ray emission is
usually greater than 1 --- typically $\sim 1.5$. On the other hand, in the {\em
low state}, the hard X-ray energy index is 0.3 -- 0.9. In this paper, we
suggest that this difference of the hard X-ray spectral slopes may be due to
two different Comptonization mechanisms. We propose that, in the high state,
the hard component is governed by the Comptonization due to the bulk motion of
the almost freely falling (convergent accretion) flow close to the black hole,
rather than thermal Comptonization. The spectral slope of the hard component is
insensitive to the disk accretion rate governing the soft component, hence is
nearly invariant in spite of the soft component variations. The power-law
component due to the bulk motion Comptonization has a sharp cut-off at around
the electron rest mass energy, which is consistent with high energy
observations of the high state. In the low state, the spectrum is formed due to
thermal Comptonization of the low-frequency disk radiation by a sub-Keplerian
component (possibly undergoing a centrifugally-supported shock) which is
originated from the Keplerian disk. In the limit of low disk accretion rate,
the power law index is uniquely determined by the mass accretion rate of the
sub-Keplerian component.

Dark Matter model has been excluded on the basis that it predicts far too many
large--separation double images. These studies assume that the lensing
structure has the mass profile of a singular isothermal sphere. However, such
large splittings would be produced by very massive systems such as clusters of
galaxies, for which other gravitational lensing data suggest less singular mass
profiles. Here we analyze two cases of mass profiles for lenses: an isothermal
sphere with a finite core radius (density $\rho \propto
(r^2+r_{core}^2)^{-1})$, and a Hernquist profile ($\rho \propto
r^{-1}(r+a)^{-3}$). We find that small core radii $r_{core} \sim 30 h^{-1}$
kpc, as suggested by the cluster data, or large $a \gsim 300 h^{-1}$ kpc, as
needed for compatibility with gravitational distortion data, would reduce the
number of large--angle splittings by an order of magnitude or more. Thus, it
appears that these tests are sensitive both to the cosmological model (number
density of lenses) and to the inner lens structure, which is unlikely to depend
sensitively on the cosmology, making it difficult to test the cosmological
models by large--separation quasar lensing until we reliably know the structure
of the lenses themselves.

The algorithm makes no assumptions regarding the shapes of the voids and the

preset limit, thus eliminating connections between adjacent voids through smal
breaches in the walls. By appropriate scaling of the parameters with the

nuclear UV ($\sim 2300$\AA) source in the {\it HST} images. The remaining 19
LINERs are ``UV-dark'', with no detectable compact nuclear source. In the six
UV-bright objects, the UV flux is correlated with H$\alpha$ flux. When
extrapolated beyond the Lyman limit, the UV luminosity is sufficient to produce
the observed H$\alpha$ luminosity through photoionization. Some LINERs
therefore have a UV continuum source consistent with the expectations from the
micro-quasar hypothesis. The 19 UV-dark objects are comparable in H$\alpha$
flux and luminosity to the UV-bright objects, and their darkness is not a
detection-limit problem. Extinction by the host galaxy disk or other foreground
dust cannot explain the entire effect. I consider several hypotheses explaining
why only $\sim 25\%$ of LINERs display a central UV source: Obscuration of the
UV source by NLR dust or a molecular torus; the UV source is ``turned-off''
most of the time; photoionization by an extended population of old stars; or,
most LINERs are not photoionized objects. I discuss observational tests that
will soon discriminate between these possibilities.

Euclidean dimensions, or for four-dimensional thermal gauge theories, the usual
procedure of getting a general covariant gauge-fixing term by averaging over a
class of covariant gauge-fixing conditions leads to a nontrivial gauge-fixing
parameter dependence in gauge variant two-point correlation functions (e.g.
fermion propagators). This nontrivial gauge-fixing parameter dependence
modifies the large distance behavior of the two-point correlation functions by
introducing additional exponentially decaying factors. These factors are the
origin of the gauge dependence encountered in some perturbative evaluations of
the damping rates and the static chromoelectric screening length in a general
covariant gauge. To avoid this modification of the long distance behavior
introduced by performing the average over a class of covariant gauge-fixing
conditions, one can either choose a vanishing gauge-fixing parameter or apply
an unphysical infrared cutoff.

{\it ``degree of belief''} and on Bayes' theorem, the basic tool for assigning
probabilities to hypotheses combining {\it a priori} judgements and
experimental information. This was the original point of view of Bayes,
Bernoulli, Gauss, Laplace, etc. and contrasts with later ``conventional''
(pseudo-)definitions of probabilities, which implicitly presuppose the concept
of probability. These notes show that the Bayesian approach is the natural one
for data analysis in the most general sense, and for assigning uncertainties to
the results of physical measurements - while at the same time resolving
philosophical aspects of the problems. The approach, although little known and
usually misunderstood among the High Energy Physics community, has become the
standard way of reasoning in several fields of research and has recently been
adopted by the international metrology organizations in their recommendations
for assessing measurement uncertainty.
  These notes describe a general model for treating uncertainties originating
from random and systematic errors in a consistent way and include examples of
applications of the model in High Energy Physics, e.g. ``confidence intervals''
in different contexts, upper/lower limits, treatment of ``systematic errors'',
hypothesis tests and unfolding.

to solve the string equations of motion in curved spacetimes are described.That

construction of global solutions.The behaviour of strings in FRW and inflatio-
nary spacetimes is obtained from the various types of string solutions. Three
different types of behaviour appear:{\bf unstable, dual} to unstable and {\bf
stable}.For the unstable strings, the energy and size grow proportional to $R$
for large scale factors $R \to \infty$. For the dual to unstable strings, the
energy and size blow up for R\to 0 as 1/R. For stable strings, the energy and
size are bounded. (In Minkowski, all solutions are of the stable type). The
self-consistent solution to the Einstein equations for string dominated
universes is reviewed. The energy-momentum tensor for a gas of strings is taken
as source and from the above behaviours the string equation of state is {\bf
derived}. The self-consistent string solution exhibits realistic matter
dominated behaviour for large times and radiation dominated behaviour for early
times. We report on the {\bf exact integrability} of the string dynamics in de
Sitter spacetime that allows to systematically find {\bf exact} string
solutions by soliton methods. {\bf Multistring solutions} are a new feature in
curved spacetimes. That is, a single world-sheet simultaneously describes many
different and independent strings. This phenomenon has no analogue in flat
spacetime and follows from the coupling of the strings with the geometry.
Finally, the string dynamics next and inside a Schwarzschild black hole is
analyzed and their physical properties discussed.

Fourier transforms of time correlation functions, as given by the quantum
regression theorem for systems described by master equations. Quantum state
diffusion (QSD) gives a useful method of solving these problems by unraveling
the master equation into stochastic trajectories; but there is no generally
accepted definition of a time correlation function for a single QSD trajectory.
In this paper we show how QSD can be used to calculate these spectra directly;
by formally solving the equations which arise, we arrive at a natural
definition for a two-time correlation function in QSD, which depends explicitly
on both the stochastic noise of the particular trajectory and the time of
measurement, and which agrees in the mean with the ensemble average definition
of correlation functions.

compared with those of the rigged Hilbert space quantum mechanics. We discuss
the time evolution of Gamow and Gamow-Jordan vectors and show that the rigged
Hilbert space case admits a new kind of irreversibility which does not appear
in the conventional case. The origin of this irreversibility can be traced back
to different initial-boundary conditions for the states and observables. It is
shown that this irreversibility does not contradict the experimentally tested
consequences of the time-reversal invariance of the conventional case but
instead we have to introduce a new time reversal operator.

proper generalization to 3 dimensions of the zero curvature relation. Recently,
Korepanov has constructed an infinite set of integrable 3-dimensional lattice
models, and has related them to solutions to the local YBE. The simplest
Korepanov's model is related to the star-triangle relation in the Ising model.
In this paper the corresponding discrete equation is derived. In the continuous
limit it leads to a differential 3d equation, which is symmetric with respect
to all permutations of the three coordinates. A similar analysis of the
star-triangle transformation in electric networks leads to the discrete
bilinear equation of Miwa, associated with the BKP hierarchy. Some related
operator solutions to the tetrahedron equation are also constructed.
