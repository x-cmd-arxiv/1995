are calculated in a semiclassical approach at large momentum transfer $Q^2$ and
small values of the scaling variable $x$. The basic process is the production
of a quark-antiquark pair in the colour field of the proton. The structure
functions are expressed in terms of Wilson lines along the classical
trajectories of quark and antiquark passing through the colour field, and their
covariant derivatives. Based on some rather general assumptions on properties
of the colour field, inclusive and diffractive structure functions are
evaluated in terms of four field dependent constants.

$\Lambda_{\mathrm{b}}$ baryons produced in $e^+e^-$-annihilation at the
$\mathrm{Z}$ resonance through their inclusive semileptonic decays. After
reviewing the existing methods, a new method is proposed, based on the ratio of
the averages of the squared electron and neutrino energy, including both
perturbative and nonperturbative corrections. This variable minimizes the
statistical error on the $\Lambda_{\mathrm{b}}$ polarization, while keeping the
systematic theoretical errors at the level of 1-2%. A number of other
polarization-sensitive variables are also discussed, such as averages of ratios
of the electron and neutrino energy and the distribution in the difference of
the electron and neutrino rapidities.

transformation properties of the partition function under target-space duality.
Contrary to what one would expect, we find that it is not, in general,
invariant. In fact, besides the dilaton shift emerging from the Jacobian of the
duality transformation of the bosonic part, there also exist a Jacobian for the
fermionic part since fermions are also transform under the duality process. The
latter is just the parity of the spin structure of the word sheet and since it
cannot be compensated, the dual theory is not equvalent to the original one.
