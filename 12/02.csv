next-to-leading order corrections to scaling are also derived. We explain why
the universal scaling behaviour is spoiled when the initial distributions rise
too steeply by considering the nonsinglet distribution F_2^p-F_2^n as an
explicit example. We then examine the stability of double scaling to the
inclusion of higher order singularities, explaining how the perturbative
expansion at small x can be reorganized in such a way that each order is given
by the sum of a convergent series of contributions which are of arbitrarily
high order in the coupling. The wave-like nature of perturbative evolution is
then shown to persist throughout almost all the small x region, giving rise
asymptotically to double scaling for a wide class of boundary conditions.

information about the nature of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions.
Insensitivity to the charm production rate is achieved by measuring normalized
cumulant. The acollinearity of the D momenta in the transverse plane is a
measure of the medium effect. Its dependence on nuclear size or E_T provides a
signature for the formation of quark matter.

to investigate the quadrupole and octupole correlations for excited
superdeformed bands in 190Hg, 192Hg, and 194Hg. The K=2 octupole vibrations are
predicted to be the lowest excitation modes at zero rotational frequency. At
finite frequency, however, the interplay between rotation and vibrations
produces different effects depending on neutron number: The lowest octupole
phonon is rotationally aligned in 190Hg, is crossed by the aligned
two-quasiparticle bands in 192Hg, and retains the K=2 octupole vibrational
character up to the highest frequency in 194Hg. The gamma vibrations are
predicted to be higher in energy and less collective than the octupole
vibrations. From a comparison with the experimental dynamic moments of inertia,
a new interpretation of the observed excited bands invoking the K=2 octupole
vibrations is proposed, which suggests those octupole vibrations may be
prevalent in SD Hg nuclei.

perturbative Chern-Simon theory, takes values in the algebra of oriented
3-valent graphs. This algebra is a Hopf algebra, graded by half the number of
vertices in 3-valent graphs. The degree 1 term of the invariant coincides with
Casson-Walker-Lescop invariant. The degree $n$ term is constructed out of the
universal Vassiliev invariant of links of degree less than or equal to $(l+1)n$
where $l$ is the number of link components.
