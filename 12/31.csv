dynamics, light curves and spectra continue to point to the difficult
conclusion that SN~Ia result from degenerate ignition in a carbon/oxygen white
dwarf of the Chandrasekhar mass. Such a model accounts well for the ``normal""
SN~Ia and for the observed dispersion exemplified by the light curve
amplitude-shape relation. The criterion that the white dwarfs involved in this
process grow to nearly 1.4 Msun continues to provide a great challenge to
understanding the binary stellar evolution involved. The so-called ``supersoft
X-ray sources"" may provide an important new population of SN~Ia progenitors.
Other techniques are being developed that may constrain the binary evolution.

low energy neutral current experiments for signals of new physics. The reasons
for doing this are twofold, first to explain the deviations from the standard
model observed in $R_b$ and $R_c$ and second to constrain non-standard
contributions to couplings of the $Z^0$ boson to all fermions and to the
oblique parameters. We do so by comparing the data with the Standard Model as
well as with a number of test hypotheses concerning the nature of the new
physics. These include non-standard $Zb\bar{b}$-, $Zc\bar{c}$- and
$Zs\bar{s}$-couplings as well as the couplings of the $Z^0$ to fermions of the
entire first, second and third generations and universal corrections to all up-
and down-type quark couplings (as can arise \eg\ in $Z'$ mixing models). We
find that non-standard $Zb\bar{b}$ couplings are both necessary and sufficient
to explain the data and in particular the $R_b$ anomaly. It is not possible to
explain $R_b$, $R_c$ and a value of the strong coupling constant consistent
with low energy determinations invoking only non-standard $Zb\bar{b}$- and
$Zc\bar{c}$-couplings. To do so one has to have also new physics contributions
to the $Zs\bar{s}$ or universal corrections to all $Zq\bar{q}$ couplings.

to infinity, it can be shown that vacuum to vacuum tunnelling solutions exist.
A precise description of the moduli space for T**3xR, studied numerically using
lattice techniques, remains an interesting open problem. New is an explicit
application of the Nahm transformation to (anti-)selfdual constant curvature
solutions on T**4 and a discussion of its properties relevant to instantons on
T**3xR.

mass. Considerations based on operator product expansions suggest that these
equations are particular truncations of the full string equations. The method
involves broadening the loop to a band of finite thickness that describes all
the different interacting strings. Interestingly, in terms of these variables,
the theory appears non-interacting.

every conjugation class of the braid group contains woven braids. In
consequence, links can be presented as plats or closures of woven braids.
Restricting on knots, we get the 'woven version' of the well-known theorem of
Markov, giving moves that are capable of producing all woven braids with
equivalent closures. As corollary we obtain that a link in which each component
is dyed with at least two colours can be projected onto a plane without
crossing strands of the same colour. Finally a table of minimal woven braids
for all nine crossing knots is appended.
