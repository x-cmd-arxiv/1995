triggering of starburst activity in mergers of comparable-mass disk galaxies.
In all encounters studied, the galaxies experience strong gaseous inflows and
moderate to intense starburst activity. We find that galaxy structure plays a
dominant role in regulating activity. The gaseous inflows are strongest when
galaxies with dense central bulges are in the final stages of merging, while
inflows in bulgeless galaxies are weaker and occur earlier in the interaction.
Orbital geometry plays only a relatively modest role in the onset of
collisionally-induced activity. Through an analysis of the torques acting on
the gas, we show that these inflows are generally driven by gravitational
torques from the host galaxy (rather than the companion), and that dense bulges
act to stabilize galaxies against bar modes and inflow until the galaxies
merge, at which point rapidly varying gravitational torques drive strong
dissipation and inflow of gas in the merging pair. The strongest inflows (and
associated starburst activity) develop in co-planar encounters, while the
activity in inclined mergers is somewhat less intense and occurs slightly later
during the merger. The starbursts which develop in mergers of galaxies with
central bulges represent an increase in the star formation rate of two orders
of magnitude over that in isolated galaxies. We find that the gaseous and
stellar morphology and star-forming properties of these systems provide a good
match to those of observed ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Our results imply
that the internal structure of the merging galaxies, rather than orbital
geometry, may be the key factor in producing ultraluminous infrared galaxies.

curvature localized near its core. The resulting global structure of the
membrane has mean curvature, which is disfavored by curvature energy. Thus a
membrane with an isolated disclination undergoes a buckling transition from a
flat to a buckled state as the ratio $\kappa/K_{A}$ of the bending rigidity
$\kappa$ to the hexatic rigidity $K_{A}$ is decreased. In this paper we
calculate the buckling transition and the energy of both a positive and a
negative disclination. A negative disclination has a larger energy and a
smaller critical value of $\kappa/K_{A}$ at buckling than does a positive
disclination. We use our results to obtain a crude estimate of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature in a membrane. This estimate is
higher than the transition temperature recently obtained by the authors in a
renormalization calculation.

superfluid into the normal phase. The subsequent cooling of this region back
through the superfluid transition results in the nucleation of quantized
vortices. Depending on the superflow velocity, sufficiently large vortex rings
grow under the influence of the Magnus force and escape into the container
volume where they are detected individually with nuclear magnetic resonance.
The larger the superflow velocity the smaller the rings which can expand. Thus
it is possible to obtain information about the morphology of the initial defect
network. We suggest that the nucleation of vortices during the rapid cool-down

cosmological phase transitions in the early universe.

discrete light-front quantization. The transverse component of the gauge fields
is taken to be compact, but in a linearized approximation with an effective
potential. The (rest-frame) $Q\bar{Q}$ potential is evaluated numerically using
Lanzcos matrix diagonalization. We first discuss the strong coupling limit
analytically and then present numerical results beyond the strong coupling
limit. The physical origin of confinement on a transverse lattice depends on
the orientation of the external charges: For longitudinally separated charges,
confinement arises from the instantaneous Coulomb interaction and for
transversely separated quarks a string of link-fields forms. In the general
case one obtains a superposition of both effects. Despite the asymetry in the
microscopic mechanism, already a very simple ansatz for the effective
link-field potential provides an almost rotationally invariant $Q\bar{Q}$
potential. The momentum carried by the glue depends strongly on the orientation
of the external charges, which might have observable consequences.

QCD equalities to recent calculations of decuplet baryon magnetic moments in

contribution to nucleon magnetic moments is found to be large at $G_M^s(0) =

  0(e^{-n^epsilon}) for some epsilon > 0",,"Ann. Pure Appl. Logic 82 (1996), 97-102",,"Shelah [Sh:551]","math.LO math.CO",,"  Shelah Spencer [ShSp:304] proved the 0-1 law for the random graphs G(n,p_n),
p_n=n^{- alpha}, alpha in (0,1) irrational (set of nodes in [n]= {1, ...,n},
the edges are drawn independently, probability of edge is p_n). One may wonder
what can we say on sentences psi for which Prob (G(n,p_n) models psi) converge
to zero, Lynch asked the question and did the analysis, getting (for every
psi):
  EITHER [(alpha)] Prob [G(n,p_n) models psi]=cn^{- beta} + O(n^{-
beta-epsilon}) for some epsilon such that beta >epsilon>0
  OR [(beta)] Prob (G(n,p_n) models psi)= O(n^{-epsilon}) for every epsilon>0.
  Lynch conjectured that in case (beta) we have
  [(beta^+)] Prob (G(n,p_n) models psi)= O(e^{-n^epsilon}) for some epsilon>0.
We prove it here.
