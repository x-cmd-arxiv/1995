microwave background (CMB) experiments. A simple way to estimate the CMB
temperature in a given pixel is to fit for the amplitudes of the CMB and the
various foreground components. The variance squared of this estimator is shown
to be equal to $[(FDF)^2\ \sigzt + \sigsh^2]$, where $\sigz$ is the variance in
the absence of foregrounds; $\sigsh$ is the variance due to the uncertainty in
the shapes of the foreground components; and FDF is the {\it foreground
degradation factor}. This one number, the FDF, gives a good indication of the
ability of a given experiment to disentangle the CMB from foreground sources. A
variety of applications relating to the planning and analyzing of experiments
is presented.

with a charge density wave (CDW) instability is treated within the random phase
approximation which includes both CDW and spin density wave correlations. We
show that the CDW is sensitive to both orbital and Pauli effects of the field.
In the case of perfect nesting, the critical temperature decreases monotonously
with the field, and the wave vector of the instability starts to shift above
some critical value of magnetic field. Depending on the ratio between the spin
and charge coupling constants and on the direction of the applied magnetic
field, the wave vector shift is either parallel ($CDW_x$ order) or
perpendicular ($CDW_y$ order) to the most conducting direction. The $CDW_x$
order is a field dependent linear combination of the charge and spin density
waves and is sensible only to the Pauli effect. The wave vector shift in
$CDW_y$ depends on the interchain coupling, but the critical temperature does
not. This order is affected by the confinement of the electronic orbits. By
increasing the relative strength of the orbital effect with respect to the
Pauli effect, one can destroy the $CDW_y$, establishing either a $CDW_x$, or a
$CDW_0$ (corresponding to perfect nesting wave vector). We also show that by
increasing the imperfect nesting parameter, one passes from the regime where
the critical temperature decreases with the field to the regime where it is
initially enhanced by the orbital effect and eventually suppressed by the Pauli
effect. For a bad nesting, the quantized phases of the field-induced CDW
appear.

typically suffer from the shortcoming that the symmetry breaking scale is
driven to nearly the Planck scale by observational constraints. In this paper
we investigate inflationary potentials in a general context, and show that this
difficulty is characteristic only of potentials $V(\phi)$ dominated near their
maxima by terms of order $\phi^2$. We find that potentials dominated by terms
of order $\phi^m$ with \hbox{$m > 2$} can satisfy observational constraints at
an arbitrary symmetry breaking scale. Of particular interest, the spectral
index of density fluctuations is shown to depend only on the order of the
lowest non-vanishing derivative of $V(\phi)$ near the maximum. This result is
illustrated in the context of a specific model, with a broken ${\rm SO(3)}$

short-distance (`throat') region equivalent to a WZW theory. At distances
larger than the compactification scale the solitonic string reduces to a dyonic
static spherically-symmetric black hole of toroidally compactified heterotic
string. The new four-dimensional solution is parameterised by five charges,
saturates the Bogomol'nyi bound and has nontrivial dilaton-axion field and
moduli fields of two-torus. When acted by combined T- and S-duality
transformations it serves as a generating solution for all the static
spherically-symmetric BPS-saturated configurations of the low-energy heterotic
string theory compactified on six-torus. Solutions with regular horizons have
the global space-time structure of extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black holes with
the non-zero thermodynamic entropy which depends only on conserved (quantised)
charge vectors. The independence of the thermodynamic entropy on moduli and
axion-dilaton couplings strongly suggests that it should have a microscopic
interpretation as counting degeneracy of underlying string configurations. This
interpretation is supported by arguments based on the corresponding
six-dimensional conformal field theory. The expression for the level of the WZW
theory describing the throat region implies a renormalisation of the string
tension by a product of magnetic charges, thus relating the entropy and the
number of oscillations of the solitonic string in compact directions.

The proposed scheme essentially relies upon explicit separation of the initial
constraints into infinitely reducible first and second class ones (by making
use of some appropriately constructed covariant projectors). Reducibility of
the second class constraints involved manifests itself in weakening some
properties of the bracket as compared to the standard Dirac one. In particular,
a commutation of any quantity with the second class constraints and the Jacobi
identity take place on the second class constraints surface only. The developed
procedure is realized for N=1 Brink--Schwarz superparticle in arbitrary
dimension and for N=1, D=9 massive superparticle with Wess--Zumino term. A
possibility to apply the bracket for quantizing the superparticles within the
framework of the recent unified algebra approach by Batalin and Tyutin [20--22]

neutron-to-proton ratios are described in the framework of the self-consistent
mean-field theory with pairing formulated in coordinate space. This theory
properly accounts for the influence of the particle continuum, which is
particularly important for weakly bound systems. The pairing properties of
nuclei far from stability are studied with several interactions emphasizing
different aspects, such as the range and density dependence of the effective
interaction. Measurable consequences of spatially extended pairing fields are
presented, and the sensitivity of the theoretical predictions to model details
is discussed.

for nuclei close to the two-neutron drip line by the Hartree-Fock Bogoliubov
method taking into account resonances in the continuum. We use a Skyrme
interaction to describe the Hartee-Fock hamiltonian and a density-dependent
zero-range interaction to evaluate the pairing field. The mean-field equations
are solved in a three-dimensional cubic mesh. We study the stability of the
two-neutron separation energies and of the description of the nuclear surface
as a function of the number of active mean-field orbitals and of the size of
the mesh. The even Ni isotopes are used as a test case and the accuracy as a
function of quadrupole deformation is studied by performing constrained
calculations. A first application to the study of the two-neutron separation
energies in Ni isotopes up to the drip line is presented.

Its graded dual bialgebra is a free braided tensor bialgebra.
