twice as many PAs) beyond previous work. We have attained 10 km/s accuracy in
the mean velocity out to nearly 2 effective radii (r_e), and errors are < 15%
of the maximum rotation speed out to nearly 3 r_e. The lack of detectable
minor-axis rotation and the nearly identical kinematics on the +/- 45 degree
PAs suggest that NGC 1700 is nearly oblate for r < 2.5 r_e. Beyond this radius,
twisting of the morphological and kinematic axes indicate increasing
triaxiality, an intrinsic twist, or both. The velocity distribution in the
low-amplitude counterrotating core is weakly skewed in the direction of
rotation, arguing against a central stellar disk. The small skewness and the
depression of the central velocity dispersion are consistent with the accretion
of a low-mass stellar companion in a retrograde orbit. Photometric fine
structure at large radii (Schweizer \& Seitzer 1992) is also indicative of a
merger; a velocity reversal 50 arcsec northeast suggests a major event.
However, radially increasing prograde rotation in the main body of the galaxy
implies that this was not the same event responsible for the counterrotating
core. The strong rotation at large R and the nearly oblate shape are consistent
with N-body simulations of group mergers (Weil 1995); that all disturbances
inside 2.5 r_e have phase-mixed out suggests that NGC 1700 owes its present
form to a merger of 3 or more stellar systems 2 to 4 h^-1 Gyr ago.

implies that the opening angle of the radiation cone is large (half angle
approximately 45 degrees). We also derive a mass estimate of 8x10^{10} Msun for
the central region of 3C265 from its rotation curve. The implied mass-to-light

evolving anisotropic smoothing kernels, in which the geometric approach of
Shapiro et al. (1996; Paper I) is replaced by an approach involving a local
transformation of coordinates to those in which the underlying anisotropic
volume changes appear to be isotropic. The ASPH method is presented in 2D and
3D, including a number of details not previously included in Paper I, some of
which represent either advances or different choices with respect to Paper I.
Among the advances included here are an asynchronous time-integration scheme
with different time steps for different particles and the generalization of the
ASPH method to 3D. The shock-tracking algorithm described in Paper I for
locally adapting the artificial viscosity to restrict viscous heating just to
particles encountering shocks, is not included here. Instead, we adopt a
different interpolation kernel for use with the artificial viscosity, which has
the effect of spatially localizing effects of the artificial viscosity. This
version of the ASPH method in 2D and 3D is then applied to a series of 1D, 2D,
and 3D test problems, and the results are compared to those of standard SPH
applied to the same problems. These include the problem of cosmological pancake
collapse, the Riemann shock tube, cylindrical and spherical Sedov blast waves,
the collision of two strong shocks, and problems involving shearing disks
intended to test the angular momentum conservation properties of the method.
These results further support the idea that ASPH has significantly better
resolving power than standard SPH for a wide range of problems, including that
of cosmological structure formation. (Abridged)

desirable property that the observable dispersions in the radial and proper

models reduces to that of the singular isothermal sphere. The Jeans solutions
for scale-free densities of arbitrary flattening that can correspond to

approximate solution of the collisionless Boltzmann equation is found which
provides a third (partial) integral of good accuracy for thin and near-thin

the construction of many simple three-integral distribution functions. The

  J. Accepted",,"10.1086/177407",,"astro-ph",,"  We present Monte Carlo simulations of dusty spiral galaxies, modelled as
bulge + disk systems, aimed to study their extinction and polarization
properties. The extinction parameters (absorption and scattering) of dust
grains are calculated from Mie's theory for a full distribution of sizes and
materials; the radiation transfer is carried on for the four Stokes parameters.
Photometric and polarimetric maps of galaxies of different optical depths,
inclinations and bulge-to-total ratios have been produced in the B and I
bandpasses. As expected, the effect of scattering is to reduce substantially
the extinction for a given optical depth, in particular for what concerns the
obscuration of bright bulge cores. For the same reason, scattering reduces also
the reddening, as evaluated from B-I maps. On the other hand the bluing
directly due to forward scattering is hardly appreciable. Radial color
gradients are often found. A comparison with ``sandwich'' models shows that
they fail dramatically to reproduce the extinction - optical depth relation.
The degree of linear polarization produced by scattering is usually of the
order of a few percent; it increases with optical depth, and with inclination
(less than 80 degrees). The polarization pattern is always perpendicular to the
major axis, unless the dust distribution is drastically modified. There is
little local correlation between extinction and polarization degree and there
is a trend of increasing polarization from the B to the I band. We discuss
implications and relevance of the results for studies of the structure and
morphology of spiral galaxies and of their interstellar medium.

observable in systems where the scattering rate depends noticeably on the Fermi

surfaces is an experimental and theoretical arena for many-body interactions.
To model new facets, we use a generalized time-dependent Newns-Anderson
Hamiltonian which includes electron spin, multiple atomic orbitals with image
shifted levels, intra-atomic Coulomb repulsion, and resonant exchange. A
variational electronic many-body wave function solves the dynamical problem.
The wave function consists of sectors with either zero or one particle-hole
pair and goes beyond earlier work through the inclusion of amplitudes for a
neutral atom plus an electron-hole pair. Higher order sectors with more than
one particle-hole pair are suppressed by powers of $1/N$; hence the wave
function ansatz is equivalent to a $1/N$ expansion. The equations of motion are
integrated numerically without further approximation. The solution shows
improved loss-of-memory -- the final charge state is independent of the initial
one -- in agreement with theoretical and experimental expectations.
Understanding of this phenomenon is deepened through an analysis of entropy
production. By studying the independent-particle approximation, and by
examining the role played by different sectors of the Hilbert space in entropy
production, we arrive at necessary and sufficient conditions for loss-of-memory
to occur in the many-body solution. As further tests of the theory, we
reproduce the experimentally observed peak in the excited neutral Li(2p)
occupancy at intermediate work functions starting from different initial
conditions. Next, we include Auger processes by adding two-body interaction
terms to the many-body Hamiltonian. Several types of Auger processes are
considered, and these are shown to affect the final state occupancies at low

found in the strong-coupling regime for $d > 2$, in which $f$ must exceed a
critical force $f_c$ in order to drive the interface with constant velocity. We
find $v(f) \sim (f-f_c)^{\alpha (d)}$ for $f \searrow f_{c}$. In particular,
the exponent $\alpha (d) = 2/(d-2)$ for $2<d<4$, but saturates at $\alpha(d)=1$
for $d>4$, indicating that for this simple problem, there exists a finite upper
critical dimension $d_u=4$. For $d>2$ the surface distortion caused by the
applied force scales logarithmically with distance within a critical radius
$R_{c} \sim (f-f_{c})^{-\nu(d)}$, where $\nu(d) = \alpha (d)/2$. Connections

curvature at that point (we must exclude however linear verteces because they
may be reducing eigenvalues without being reducing essential eigenvalues). This
result allows us to give an elegant proof of a conjecture of Joel Anderson:
{\it A compact perturbation of a scalar multiple of the identity operator can
not have the closure of its numerical range equal to half a disk (neither equal

is directly appropriate only for light nuclei. We study a mixing of two narrow

arbitrary odd codifferential. Hochschild cohomology classifies the deformations
of an associative algebra into an A-infinity algebra, and cyclic cohomology in
the presence of an invariant inner product classifies the deformations of the
associative algebra into an A-infinity algebra preserving the inner product.
Similarly, a graded Lie algebra is simply a special case of an odd
codifferential on the exterior coalgebra of a vector space, and an L-infinity
algebra is a more general codifferential. In this paper, ordinary and cyclic
cohomology of L-infinity algebras is defined, and it is shown that the
cohomology of a Lie algebra (with coefficients in the adjoint representation)
classifies the deformations of the Lie algebra into an L-infinity algebra.
Similarly, the cyclic cohomology of a Lie algebra with an invariant inner
product classifies the deformations of the Lie algebra into an L-infinity
algebra which preserve the invariant inner product. The exterior coalgebra of a
vector space is dual to the symmetric coalgebra of the parity reversion of the
space, while the tensor coalgebra of a vector space is dual to the tensor
coalgebra of its parity reversion. Using this duality, we introduce a modified
bracket in the space of coderivations of the tensor and exterior coalgebras

as a differential graded algebra in the same manner in which the Gerstenhaber
bracket is used to transform the Hochschild cochains of an associative algebra

treat the large quantum fluctuations leading to a nonlinear fluctuation
