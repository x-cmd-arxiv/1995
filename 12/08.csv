distinct \ion{H}{1}~counterparts to its nuclear ring, inner ring, outer
pseudoring, and plume-like features. The $L_{4}$ and $L_{5}$ regions at
corotation, as well as the bar itself, are relatively devoid of neutral atomic

more extended \ion{H}{1}~disk than NGC~1433. There is a gas ring underlying the
inner pseudoring, but it is both broader and slightly larger in diameter than
the optical feature. By again linking this inner ring feature to the inner
second harmonic resonance, we derive a bar pattern speed for NGC~6300 of
$27\pm8$~km~s$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-1}$, but in this case, neither the outer pseudoring
nor the nuclear ring predicted by the resonance-ring theory can be identified

other frequency bands, the PSPC data are represented best by simple power-law
source spectra ($dN/dE \propto E^\Gamma$) with a slope $\Gamma = -2.5\pm 0.4$
and do not show evidence for a more complex structure. However, within the
limits given by statistics and systematical errors, a superposition of two
power-law spectra, which allows a connection to the observed UV fluxes and to
the generally flatter hard-X-ray spectra observed by EXOSAT and GINGA, is found
to be indistinguishable from a simple power-law in the PSPC energy band. For
the PG quasars, a direct connection to the observed UV flux is obtained with a
steep soft-X-ray slope $\Gamma_{sx}= -3.1\pm 0.3$, fixing the hard-X-ray slope.
For PHL 1657, the soft-X-ray spectrum seen by ROSAT is much steeper than the
GINGA spectrum, rising towards the EUV in $\nu F_\nu$, and it can not be
extrapolated down to meet the exceptionally weak UV flux. A Wien-shaped thermal
UV/soft-X-ray bump with a temperature of $\sim $50\,eV connects the UV and
soft-X-ray spectra in all cases, but gives only a poor representation of the
high signal-to-noise PSPC spectra. We discuss implications of our results for

contribution we address the problem of calculating the eigenenergies and the
eigenstates by various numerical methods applied to 2-dim generic billiard
systems. In particular we analyze the dependence of the accuracy (errors) on
the density of discretization of the given numerical method. We do this for
several different billiard shapes, especially for the Robnik billiard. We study
the numerical error of the boundary integral method and the plane wave
decomposition method as a function of the discretization parameter $b$ which by
definition is the number of discretization nodes on the boundary per one de
Broglie wavelength (arclength) interval. For boundary integral method, we
discover that at each $\lambda$ the error scales as a power law $<|\Delta E|> =
A b^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is a strong function of $\lambda$: In the
KAM-like regime $0\le \lambda\le 1/4$ it is large and close to 3.5, but close
to $\lambda = 1/4$ it changes almost discontinuously becoming hardly any larger
than zero. This is because the billiard becomes nonconvex beginning at
$\lambda=1/4$. For the plane wave decomposition method, we found at a fixed $b$
that the average absolute value of the error $<|\Delta E|>$ correlates strongly
with the classical chaos, where the error $<|\Delta E|>$ does increase sharply
with increasing classical chaos. This property is valid also for Bunimovich
stadium and the Sinai billiard.

approximation, a simple expression is obtained that relates the cross section
to the underlying atom/defect interaction potential. An approximate inversion
formula is given, that determines the shape function of the defect from the
scattering data. Another inversion formula approximately determines the
potential due to a weak corrugation in the case of substitutional disorder. An
Optical Theorem, derived in the framework of the Sudden approximation, plays a
central role in deriving the equations that conveniently relate the interaction
potential to the cross section. Also essential for the result is the
equivalence of the operational definition for the cross section for scattering
by a defect, given by Poelsema and Comsa, and the formal definition from
quantum scattering theory. This equivalence is established here. The inversion

random rough surfaces. We apply our simple general approach\cite{r1} to
transport in very narrow channels, when the particles wavelength is comparable
to the width of the channels and the motion across the channel is characterized
by discrete quantum states. The discrete nature of the spectrum leads to a
non-analyticity of transport coefficients as a function of thickness or channel
width, especially for degenerate fermions. Surface inhomogeneity leads to both
on-level scattering and interlevel transitions. As in\cite{r1}, transport
coefficients are expressed explicitly via the correlation function of surface
inhomogeneities. The shape of the curves for the dependence of transport
coefficients on the number of particles and/or film thickness is determined by
the correlation radius of surface inhomogeneities and is not sensitive to their
amplitude. For short range correlations, the curves assume a saw-like shape as
a result of the interlevel transitions. With increasing correlation radius, the
interlevel transitions loose their importance, and the saw teeth gradually
decrease, reducing, in the end, to simple kinks on practically monotonic
curves. Applications include Gaussian and short-range $\delta $-type
correlations. Careful analysis of the transition from quantum to semi-classical
and classical regimes allowed us to improve the accuracy of our previous
classical calculations.

the Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) for any kind of matter/energy, except

to re-examine the standard Feynman-Deser approach of field theoretical
derivation of Einstein\rq s General Relativity. The hypothesis implicit in such
precedent derivations \cite{Feynman} \cite{Deser} concerns the universality of
gravity interaction. Although there is a strong observational basis supporting
the universality of matter to gravity interaction, there is not an equivalent
situation that supports the hypothesis that gravity interacts with gravity as
any other form of non-gravitational energy. We analyse here a kind of
gravity-gravity interaction distinct from GR but, as we shall see, that
conforms with the actual status of observation. We exhibit the gravitational
field produced by a spherically symmetric static configuration as described in
this field theory of gravity. The values that we obtain for the standard PPN
parameters ($\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 1$) coincide with those of General
Relativity. Thus, as we pointed out in a previous paper, the main different
aspect of our theory and GR concerns the velocity of the gravitational waves.
Since there is a large expectation that the detection of gravitational waves
will occur in the near future, the question of which theory describes Nature
better will probably be settled soon.

temperature QCD depends crucially on the $Z_3$ phase of the Polyakov loop

chiral order parameter to the Polyakov loop. We construct a model for chiral
symmetry breaking and restoration which includes the effect of a nontrivial
Polyakov loop by calculating the effective potential for the chiral condensate
of a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a uniform temperature dependent $A_0$ gauge
field background. Above the deconfinement temperature there are three possible
phases corresponding to the $Z_3$ symmetric phases of the Polyakov loop in the
pure gauge theory. In the phase in which ${\rm tr_c}({\cal P})$ is real and
positive the first order deconfining transition induces chiral symmetry
restoration in agreement with simulation results. In the two phases where
$Re[{\rm tr_c}({\cal P})] < 0$ the sign of the leading finite temperature
correction to the effective potential is reversed from the normal phase, and
chiral symmetry is not restored at the deconfinement transition; this agrees
with the recent simulation studies of Chandrasekharan and Christ. In the case
of $SU(N)$ a rich set of possibilites emerges. The generality of the mechanism
makes it likely to occur in full QCD as well; this will increase the lifetimes
of metastable $Z_3$ phases.

parity invariant case, where the tree-level Coulomb potential is logarithmic,
there is a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at a critical temperature
($T_c=e^2/8\pi+{\cal O}(e^4/m)$, when the ratio of the electromagnetic coupling
and the temperature to the electron mass is small). Above $T_c$ the electric
charge is not confined and the system is in a Debye plasma phase, whereas below
$T_c$ the electric charges are confined by a logarithmic Coulomb potential,
qualitatively described by the tree-level interaction. When there is a
topological mass, no matter how small, in a strict sense the theory is not
confining at any temperature; the model exhibits a screening phase, analogous
to that found in the Schwinger model and two-dimensional QCD with massless
adjoint matter. However, if the topological mass is much smaller than the other
dimensional parameters, there is a temperature for which the range of the
Coulomb interaction changes from the inverse topological mass to the inverse
electron mass. We speculate that this is a vestige of the BKT transition of the
