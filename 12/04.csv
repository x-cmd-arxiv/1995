cannot be written as a crepant resolution of a singular fibre of a degeneration
of Calabi-Yau threefolds. These should be thought as the most basic Calabi-Yau
manifolds; all others should arise through degenerations of these. This paper
first continues the study of smoothability of Calabi-Yau threefolds with
canonical singularities begun in the author's previous paper, ``Deforming
Calabi-Yau Threefolds.'' (alg-geom 9506022). If X' is a non-singular Calabi-Yau
threefold, and f:X'->X is a contraction of a divisor to a curve, we obtain
results on when X is smoothable. We then discuss applications of this result to
the classification of primitive Calabi-Yau threefolds. Combining the
deformation theoretic results of this paper with those of ``Deforming
Calabi-Yau Threefolds,'' we obtain strong restrictions on the class of
primitive Calabi-Yau threefolds. We also speculate on how such work might yield
results on connecting together all moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds.

occur between regions of plasma $\be$ (ratio of particle to magnetic pressure)

Reconnection in low $\beta$ regions is most favorable to acceleration from
reconnection shocks. The reconnection X-point regions may provide the injection
electrons for their subsequent non-thermal shock acceleration to distributions
reasonably consistent with observed spectra. Flux tube reconnection might
therefore be able to provide $in\ situ$ acceleration required by large scale

Universe is the initial conditions. Using N-body simulations, we compare the
clustering that arises from Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial conditions. The
latter is motivated by a global texture model which has initial $J$-order
correlations $\xibar_J$ close to the strongly non-Gaussian regime $\xibar_J
\simeq \xibar_2^{J/2}$. The final amplitudes $S_J \equiv
\xibar_J/\xibar_2^{J-1}$ in the non-Gaussian (texture) model evolves slowly
towards the (Gaussian) gravitational predictions but, even at $\sigma_8=1$, are
still significantly larger, showing a characteristic minimum with a sharp
increase in $S_J$ with increasing scales. This minimum, which is between $10$
and $15 \Mpc$, depending on the normalization, separates the regime where
gravity starts dominating the evolution from the one in which the initial
conditions are the dominant effect. In comparing this results with galaxy
clustering observations, one has to take into account {\it biasing}, i.e. how
galaxy fluctuations trace matter fluctuations. Although biasing could change
the amplitudes, we show that the possible distortions to the shape of $S_J$ are
typically small. In contrast to the non-Gaussian (texture) predictions, we find
no significant minimum or rise in $S_J$ obtained from the APM Galaxy Survey.

the distribution of galaxies relative to that of dark matter. The first step is
to specify how collapsed, virialized halos of dark matter trace the overall
matter distribution. The next step is to make a connection between halos and
the luminous galaxies we observe. We appeal to the results of semi-analytic
models of galaxy formation that are tuned to fit the observed luminosity
functions of local groups and clusters. We have also used a high-resolution
N-body simulation of a cold dark matter (CDM) universe to study the bias
relation in more detail. The differences between the galaxy and dark matter
distributions are quantified using a number of different clustering statistics.
We arrive at the following general conclusions: 1) A comparison of the galaxy
and dark matter density fields shows that linear biasing is a good description
on large scales. 2) The bias factor b depends on the shape and normalization of
the power spectrum. The lower the normalization, the larger the bias. More bias
is obtained for spectra with more power on large scales. For ""realistic""
models, b ranges from 1 to 2.5. 3) Galaxies of different luminosity or
morphology have different bias factors. 4) The scale dependence of the bias
factor is weak.

integrable boundary condition and the Thirring model with boundary is discussed
and the reflection $R$-matrix for the massive Thirring model, which is related
to the physical boundary parameters of the sine-Gordon model, is given. The
relationship between the the boundary parameters and the two formal parameters
appearing in the work of Ghoshal and Zamolodchikov is discussed.

that the minimal envelope of the given algebra is the algebra itself. We also
prove that the minimal envelope of the intersection of two Douglas algebras is
the intersection of their minimal envelope.

bands is studied within the particle-rotor model. Allowing for a slight
triaxiality of the rotor it is shown that the lowest states of the system for a
sufficiently high spin possess the symmetry which allows to distinguish states
differing by two units of angular momentum.

etching processes. The two scales are: (i) a depletion layer width surrounding
the aggregate and (ii) a drift length.The interplay between these two
antithetical scales yields a variety of distinct morphologies reported in
electrochemical deposition of metals, viscous fingering in fluids and in porous
silicon formation. Further, our algorithm interpolates between existing growth
models (diffusion limited aggregation, ballistic deposition and Eden) for
limiting values of these variables.

$A_2$ Macdonald polynomials into the product of two basic $3\phi_2$
hypergeometric series with known arguments. The action of the operator $K$ on
power sums in two variables can be reduced to a generalization of one
particular case of the Bailey's summation formula for a very-well-poised
$6\psi_6$ series. We also propose the conjecture for a transformation of
$6\psi_6$ series with different arguments.
