the early universe leave their imprint on the temperature anisotropies of the
CMB radiation. We consider the 3-point correlation function, as well as the
inherent theoretical uncertainties associated with it, for which we derive
explicit analytic formulae. We apply them in the study of non-Gaussian features
that arise on large scales in the framework of both inflationary and
topological defects models. For inflation, we develop a perturbative analysis
for the study of spatial correlations in the inflaton in the context of the
stochastic approach to inflation. We also include an analysis of a particular
geometry, the so-called `collapsed' 3-point function, in the case of post
recombination integrated effects, arising generically whenever the mildly non
linear growth of perturbations is taken into account. We also devote a part of
the thesis to the study of recently proposed analytic models of topological
defects, and implement them in the analysis of both the CMB excess kurtosis
(for cosmic strings) and the CMB collapsed 3-point function and skewness (for
textures). Lastly, we present a study of the CMB anisotropies on the degree
angular scale in the framework of the global texture scenario, and show the
relevant features that arise; among these, the Doppler peaks.

  in December 1997",,,,"cond-mat.str-el",,"  The Hubbard model is a ""highly oversimplified model"" for electrons in a solid
which interact with each other through extremely short ranged repulsive
(Coulomb) interaction. The Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model consists of two
pieces; H_hop which describes quantum mechanical hopping of electrons, and Hint
which describes nonlinear repulsive interaction. Either H_hop or H_int alone is
easy to analyze, and does not favor any specific order. But their sum
H=H_hop+H_int is believed to exhibit various nontrivial phenomena including
metal-insulator transition, antiferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, ferromagnetism,
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, and superconductivity. It is believed that we can
find various interesting ""universality classes"" of strongly interacting
electron systems by studying the idealized Hubbard model.
  In the present article we review some mathematically rigorous results on the
Hubbard model which shed light on ""physics"" of this fascinating model. We
mainly concentrate on magnetic properties of the model at its ground states. We
discuss Lieb-Mattis theorem on the absence of ferromagnetism in one dimension,
Koma-Tasaki bounds on decay of correlations at finite temperatures in
two-dimensions, Yamanaka-Oshikawa-Affleck theorem on low-lying excitations in
one-dimension, Lieb's important theorem for half-filled model on a bipartite
lattice, Kubo-Kishi bounds on the charge and superconducting susceptibilities
of half-filled models at finite temperatures, and three rigorous examples of
saturated ferromagnetism due to Nagaoka, Mielke, and Tasaki. We have tried to
make the article accessible to nonexperts by describing basic definitions and
elementary materials in detail.

electroweak data from LEP and SLC. On the one hand, agreement between
experiments and the Standard Model (SM) has improved for the line-shape and the
asymmetry data. The $\tau$ widths and asymmetries are now consistent with
$e$--$\mu$--$\tau$ universality, and all the asymmetry data including the
left-right asymmetry from SLC are consistent with the SM (16\%CL). On the other
hand, a discrepancy between experiments and SM predictions is sharpened for two
observables, $R_b$ and $R_c$, where $R_q$ is the partial $Z$ boson width ratio
$\Gamma_q/\Gamma_h$. $R_b$ is 3\% larger (3.7$\sigma$) and $R_c$ is 11\%
smaller (2.5$\sigma$) than the SM predictions. When combined, the SM is ruled
out at the 99.99\%CL for $m_t>170$GeV. It is difficult to interpret the $11\pm
4$\% deficit of $R_c$, since if we allow only $\Gamma_b$ and $\Gamma_c$ to
deviate from the SM then the precisely measured ratio
$R_h=\Gamma_h/\Gamma_\ell$ forces the QCD coupling to be $\alpha_s\equiv
\alpha_s(m_Z)_{\overline{\rm MS}}=0.185\pm 0.041$, which is uncomfortably
large. The data can be consistent with the prefered $\alpha_s$
($0.10<\alpha_s<0.13$) only if the sum $\Gamma_h=\Sigma_q \Gamma_q$ does not
deviate significantly from the SM prediction. Possible experimental causes for
the under-estimation of $R_c$ are discussed. By assuming the SM value for
$R_c$, the discrepancy in $R_b$ decreases to 2\% (3$\sigma$). The double
tagging technique used for the $R_b$ measurements is critically reviewed. A few
theoretical models that can explain large $R_b$ and small $\alpha_s$ ($=
0.104\pm 0.008$) are discussed. If the QCD coupling $\alpha_s$ is allowed to be
fitted by the data, the standard $S$, $T$, $U$ analysis for a new physics
