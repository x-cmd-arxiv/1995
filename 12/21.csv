temperature of 2.9$_{-0.8}^{+1.3}$ keV, which is also relatively low, but has
also a large uncertainty. The cluster shows indications of substructure, which
results in a high value for the core radius and a steep drop off outside the
core, if one fits a spherically symmetric $\beta$-model. The lower limit on the
mass inside a radius of $1.0 h_{50}^{-1}$Mpc is $2.6 \times 10^{14} \msol$, and
the upper limit on the gas mass fraction is 50\%. All the unusual properties of

the massless Dirac field is carried out. The problem is solved by the
application of the new Dynamic Quantization Method [1,2]. It is well-known that
in general covariant theories such as gravitation, a Hamiltonian is any linear
combination of the first class constraints, which can be considered as gauge
transformation generators. To perform quantization, the Dirac field modes with
gauge invariant creation and annihilation operators are selected. The
regularization of the theory is made by imposing an infinite set of the second
class constraints: almost all the gauge invariant creation and annihilation
operators (except for a finite number) are put equal to zero. As a result the
regularized theory is gauge invariant. The gauge invariant states are built by
using the remained gauge invariant fermion creation operators similar to the
usual construction of the states in any Fock space. The developed dynamic
quantization method can construct a mathematically correct perturbation theory
in a gravitational constant.

Kerr is used to study various aspects of Lorentz Covariant Gravity. Retarded
multipole moments of the source, the central objects of this study, are
defined, and a sequence of conservation equations for these are derived. These
equations are used extensively throughout the paper. The solution of the
linearized Einstein equation is obtained in terms of the retarded moments for a
general bound source, correct to $O(r^{-4})$. This is used to obtain the
peeling--off of the linearized field, and to study the geometric optics
approximation for the field and for the energy-momentum pseudotensor of the
field. It is shown that the energy-momentum 4-vector splits into the `total
radiated 4-momentum' and the `bound 4-momentum of the source', similar to the
case of the electromagnetic field. In the case of a source which has only
retarded pole, dipole and quadrupole moments, a decomposition into arbitrary
functions of a null coordinate is obtained which allows comparison with the
solutions for linearized gravity obtained by other authors.

general modify significantly the quantum boundary conservation. We consider the
first nontrivial higher--spin currents for the simply laced $a^{(1)}_n $ Toda
theories: we find that the spin--three current leads to a quantum conserved
charge only if the boundary potential is appropriately redefined through a
finite renormalization. Contrary to the expectation we demonstrate instead that
at spin four the classical symmetry does not survive quantization and we
suspect that this feature will persist at higher--spin levels. Finally we
examine the first nontrivial conservations at spin four for the $d^{(2)}_3$ and
$c^{(1)}_2$ nonsimply laced Toda theories. In these cases the addition of total
derivative terms to the bulk currents is necessary but sufficient to ensure the
existence of corresponding quantum exact conserved charges.
