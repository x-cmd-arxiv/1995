million stars observed for 190 days in 1993. Many of these events are of
extremely high signal to noise and are remarkable examples of gravitational
microlensing. The distribution of peak magnifications is shown to be consistent
with the microlensing interpretation of these events. Using a sub-sample of 1.3
million ``Clump Giant"" stars whose distance and detection efficiency are well
known, we find 13 events and estimate the microlensing optical depth toward the
Galactic Bulge as $\tau_{\rm bulge} = 3.9 {+ 1.8 \atop - 1.2} \times 10^{-6}$
averaged over an area of $\sim 12$ square degrees centered at Galactic
coordinates $\ell = 2.55^\circ$ and $b = -3.64^\circ$. This is similar to the
value reported by the OGLE collaboration, and is marginally higher than current
theoretical models for $\tau_{\rm bulge}$. The optical depth is also seen to
increase significantly for decreasing $\vert b\vert$. These results demonstrate
that obtaining large numbers of microlensing events toward the Galactic bulge

$K_{n n'}=\beta J_{nn'}$ than the range $K_{n n'} \ge 0$ assumed in the premise
of the Yang-Lee circle theorem. This range includes complex temperatures, and
we show that it is lattice-dependent. Our results thus complement the Yang-Lee
theorem, which applies for any $d$ and any lattice if $J_{nn'} \ge 0$. For the
case of uniform couplings $K_{nn'}=K$, we show that these zeros lie on the unit

(i) $-u_{c,sq} \le u \le 0$ on the square lattice, and (ii) $-u_{c,t} \le u \le

prove an exact symmetry of the reduced partition functions,
$Z_r(z,-\mu)=Z_r(-z,\mu)$. This proves that the zeros of $Z$ for these lattices
lie on $|\mu|=1$ for $-1 \le z \le 0$ as well as the Yang-Lee range $0 \le z

decreases from a high energy value of $R_{\pbar p / pp} \approx 1/2.7$, down to
$R_{\pbar p / pp} \approx 1/28$, compatible with experimental data at moderate

Landshoff mechanism, in which changes at the quark level have a strong effect
precisely because the hadronic process occurs via multiple quark scatterings.

problem. Given a bounded block matrix function
$\left(\begin{array}{cc}\Phi_{11}
&\Phi_{12}\\\Phi_{21}&\Phi_{22}\end{array}\right)$ on the unit circle the four
block problem is to minimize the $L^\infty$ norm of $\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\Phi_{11}-F&\Phi_{12}\\\Phi_{21}&\Phi_{22}\end{array}\right)$ over $F\in
H^\infty$. Such a minimizing $F$ (an optimal solution) is almost never unique.
We consider the problem to find a superoptimal solution which minimizes not
only the supremum of the matrix norms but also the suprema of all further
singular values. We give a natural condition under which the superoptimal
solution is unique.

antimatter and hypermatter - is discussed. Starting from an analysis of hyperon
and single hypernuclear properties we investigate the structure of
multi-hyperon objects (MEMOs) using an extended relativistic meson field
theory. These are contrasted with multi-strange quark states (strangelets).
Their production mechanism is studied for relativistic collisions of heavy ions
from present day experiments at AGS and SPS to future opportunities at RHIC and
LHC. It is pointed out that absolutely stable hypermatter is unlikely to be
produced in heavy ion collisions. New attention should be focused on short
lived metastable hyperclusters ($\tau \propto 10^{-10}$s) and on intensity
interferometry of multi-strange-baryon correlations.

analysis goes on by studying the associated hamiltonian structures for which
compact expressions are found. The fundamental Poisson brackets yield
q-deformations of W_{KP} and related W-type algebras which, in specific cases,
coincide with the ones constructed by Frenkel and Reshetikhin. The construction
underlies a continuous correspondence between the hamiltonian structures of the
Toda lattice and the KP hierarchies.

approach to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in a mathematically rigorous way

consistent histories scheme is compatible with the results of the operational
formulation of quantum mechanics. According to the operational approach
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is most generally formulated in terms of
effects, states and operations. We formulate a generalized consistent histories
theory using the concepts and the terminology which have proven useful in the
operational formulation of quantum mechanics. The logical rule of the logical
interpretation of quantum mechanics is generalized to the present context. The
algebraic structure of the generalized theory is studied in detail.
