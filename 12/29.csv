for newly-born neutron stars in globular clusters as a function of kick
velocity. These can be used to calculate the present day numbers of neutron
stars in globular clusters and in addressing questions such as the origin of
millisecond pulsars. As an example, the Population I kick velocity distribution
of Lyne & Lorimer (1994) is used to estimate the retained fractions of neutron
stars originating as single stars and in binary systems. For plausible initial
conditions fewer than 4% of single neutron stars are retained. The retention
fractions from binary systems can be 2 to 5 times higher. The dominant source
of retained neutron stars is found to be through binary systems which remain
bound after the first supernova, ie. high-mass X-ray binaries. The retained
fraction decreases with an increasing number of progenitors, but the retention
fraction decreases more slowly than the number of progenitors increases. On
balance, more progenitors give more neutron stars in the cluster.

cosmological bursting or steady sources valid over the entire range of fluxes,
including density evolution and either standard candle or a power law
luminosity function. These are used to derive analytic formulae for the mean
redshift, the time dilations and the dispersion of these quantities for sources
within a given flux range for Friedmann models with $\Omega=1,~ \Lambda=0$
without K-corrections, and we discuss the extension to cases with $\Omega <1$
and inclusion of K-corrections. Applications to the spatial distribution of
cosmological gamma ray burst sources are discussed, both with and without an
intrinsic energy stretching of the burst time profiles, and the implied ranges
of redshift $z$ are considered for a specific time dilation signal value. The
simultaneous consideration of time dilation information and of fits of the
number distribution versus peak flux breaks the degeneracy inherent in the
latter alone, allowing a unique determination of the density evolution index
and the characteristic luminosity of the sources. For a reported time dilation
signal of 2.25 and neglecting [including] energy stretching we find that the
proper density should evolve more steeply with redshift than comoving constant,
and the redshifts of the dimmest sources with stretching would be very large.
However, the expected statistical dispersion in the redshifts is large,
especially for power law luminosity functions, and remains compatible with that
of distant quasars. For smaller time dilation values of 1.75 and 1.35 the
redshifts are more compatible with conventional ideas about galaxy formation,
and the evolution is closer to a comoving constant or a slower evolution. More
generally, we have considered a wide range of possible measured time dilation

Moreover, there are two distinct families of both axial and polar modes. We
discuss the physics of these modes and argue that one family is primarily
associated with the interior of the star, while the second family is mainly
associated with the stellar surface. We also show that the problem of axial
perturbations has all the essential features of the polar problem as far as
gravitational waves are concerned. This means that the axial problem is much
more important than has previously been assumed. We also find some surprising
features, such as avoided crossings between the polar gravitational-wave modes
and the Kelvin f-mode as the star becomes very compact. This seems to suggest
that the f-mode should be considered on equal footing with the polar w-modes
for ultracompact stars. All modes may have the main character of trapped modes
inside the curvature potential barrier for $R/M < 3$.

scales that are already present in the theory. Successful inflationary models
can be constructed from the flat-direction fields of a renormalizable

of a simple GUT extension of the MSSM. We evade naive ``naturalness"" arguments
by allowing for more than one field to be relevant to inflation, as in ``hybrid

inflaton fields are to be associated with flat direction fields of a
supersymmetric theory. Such models predict a very low Hubble constant during
inflation, of order $10^3$-$10^4$ GeV, a scalar density perturbation index $n$

arbitrary topology. The use of dual objects allows one to reformulate the
theory in terms of new dynamical variables; however, we avoid the use of the
dual lattice entirely. Topological modes which are present in the
transformation now appear as homology classes, in contrast to the cohomology
modes found in the dual cell picture. Irregularities of dual cell complexes do
not arise in this approach. We treat the two and three dimensional cases in
detail.

out in the ``matrix derivative"" approach. BRST/anti-BRST transformation rules
are obtained by applying the horizontality condition, in the superconnection
formalism. A BRST/anti-BRST invariant quantum action is then constructed, using
an adaptation of the method devised by Baulieu and Thierry-Mieg for the
Yang-Mills case. The resulting quantum action turns out to be the same as that
of a gauge theory in the 't Hooft gauge with spontaneously broken symmetry. Our
result shows that only the even part of the supergroup acts as a gauge
symmetry, while the odd part effectively provides a global symmetry. We treat
the general formalism first, then work out the $SU(2/1)$ and $SU(2/2)$ cases
explicitly.

constructing the gauge invariant nonabelian action which contains both the one
form vector gauge field $A$ and the two form antisymmetric tensor field $B$. As
in the abelian case, the topological coupling $m B\wedge F$, where $F$ is the
field strength of $A$, makes the transmutation among $A$ and $B$ possible, and
consequently we see that the gauge field becomes massive. We find the
BRST/anti-BRST transformation rule using the horizontality condition, and
construct a BRST/anti-BRST invariant quantum action.
