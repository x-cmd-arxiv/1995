we developed a form of variational trial wave function and applied it to van
der Waals clusters: five or less atoms of Ar and Ne modeled by the
Lennard-Jones potential. In addition, we tested the trial functions for a
hypothetical, light atom resembling Ne but with only half its mass. We did not
study atoms such as He with larger de Boer parameters, i.e., systems in which
the zero point energy plays a more important role relative to the potential
energy. This is the main purpose of the present paper. In fact, we study
clusters to the very limit where the zero-point energy destroys the ground
state as a bound state. A simple picture of this un-binding transition predicts
the power law with which the energy vanishes as the de Boer parameter
approaches its critical value and the power of the divergence of the the size
of the clusters in this limit. Our numerical results are in agreement with
these predictions.

Smirnov, D. N. Manh, and A. Pasturel, \prb {\bf 52}, 3056 (1995)] which has
been very recently confirmed experimentally. Our present calculations show that
there is a strong tendency for the moments on Mn to have a non-collinear
(random) order retaining their large value of about 3~$\mu_B$. The d-electrons
on Mn demonstrate a pronounced non-rigid band behaviour which cannot be
reproduced within a simple Stoner picture. The origin of the magnetism in these
systems is a topological disorder which drives the moments formation and
frustrates their directions in the liquid phase.

running coupling constant over the finite region in momentum space. The
perturbation theory part of contributions is rendered well-defined by the
principal value prescrition for treating the Landau pole while the rest is
connected to the gluon condensate in case of observables allowing the OPE
analysis. The hypothesis of universality, i.e. the use of our parameterization
for non-OPE cases, is discussed.

physics and may lead to some observable effects in weak decays of $B$ mesons.
We show that $CP$ violation induced by $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ mixing can manifest
itself in the decay-rate asymmetry of $B^+_u\rightarrow D_{L(H)}l^+\nu^{~}_l$
vs $B^-_u\rightarrow D_{L(H)}l^-\bar{\nu}^{~}_l$. A rephasing-invariant
generalization of the Gronau-Wyler approach is made to determine the weak phase
shift in $B^{\pm}_u\rightarrow D_{L(H)}K^{\pm}$, which is only sensitive to the
underlying new physics in $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ mixing. We also demonstrate the
possible effect of $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ mixing on $CP$ violation in decay modes of
the type $B_d\rightarrow D_{L(H)}+(\pi^0, \rho^0, {\rm etc})$. Finally the
model of four quark families is taken as an example to illustrate how the new
physics affects $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ mixing, $B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing and $CP$
asymmetries in the relevant $B$ decays.

describe particles with spin, in the context of a manifestly covariant
relativistic theory governed by an invariant evolution parameter; one obtains a
consistent quantized formalism dealing with off-shell particles with spin. Our
basic requirement is that the second order equation in the theory is of the
Schr\""{o}dinger-Stueckelberg type, which exhibits features of both the
Klein-Gordon and Schr\""{o}dinger equations. This requirement restricts the
structure of the first order equation, in particular, to a chiral form. One
thus obtains, in a natural way, a theory of chiral form for massive particles,
which may contain both left and right chiralities, or just one of them. We
observe that by iterating the first order system, we are able to obtain second
order forms containing the transverse and longitudinal momentum relative to a
time-like vector $t_{\mu}t^{\mu}=-1$ used to maintain covariance of the theory.
This time-like vector coincides with the one used by Horwitz, Piron, and Reuse
to obtain an invariant positive definite space-time scalar product, which
permits the construction of an induced representation for states of a particle
with spin. We discuss the currents and continuity equations, and show that
these equations of motion and their currents are closely related to the spin
and convection parts of the Gordon decomposition of the Dirac current. The
transverse and longitudinal aspects of the particle are complementary, and can
be treated in a unified manner using a tensor product Hilbert space.
Introducing the electromagnetic field we find an equation which gives rise to
the correct gyromagnetic ratio, and is fully Hermitian under the proposed
scalar product. Finally, we show that the original structure of Dirac's

stress the fact that in most cases one has to take into account that the
execution time of a single quantum gate is related to the decoherence time of
the qubits that are involved in the computation. Although exhibited here only
for special systems, this inter-dependence of decoherence and computation time
seems to be a restriction in many current models for quantum computers and
leads to the result that the computation time T scales much stronger with L
than previously expected.
