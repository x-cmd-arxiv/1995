  To appear in Proceedings, eds. S. Kato, S. Inagaki, J. Fukue, S. Mineshige,
  Gordon & Breach Science Publishers",,,,"astro-ph",,"  General properties of advection-dominated accretion flows are discussed.
Special emphasis is given to the optically thin branch of solutions, which has
very high ion and electron temperatures and is thermally stable. This solution
branch has been applied to a number of low-luminosity accreting black holes.
The models have resolved some puzzles and have provided a straightforward
explanation of the observed spectra. The success of the models confirms that
the central objects in these low-luminosity sources are black holes. There is
some indication that advection-dominated models may be relevant also for higher
luminosity systems. The properties of the Low state of accreting black holes,
the transition from the Low state to the High state, and the similarity of hard
X-ray/gamma-ray spectra of black hole X-ray binaries and active galactic
nuclei, are explained.

  and 3 figures. Accepted in ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/309993",,"astro-ph",,"  Using a dynamical 3-D reconstruction procedure we estimate the peculiar
velocities of $R\ge0$ Abell/ACO galaxy clusters from their measured redshift
within 25000 km/sec. The reconstruction algorithm relies on the linear
gravitational instability hypothesis, assumes linear biasing and requires an
input value of the cluster $\beta$-parameter ($\beta_c \equiv
\Omega_{\circ}^{0.6}/b_c$), which we estimated in Branchini \& Plionis (1995)
to be $\beta_c\simeq 0.21$. The resulting cluster velocity field is dominated
by a large scale streaming motion along the Perseus Pisces--Great Attractor
base-line directed towards the Shapley concentration, in qualitative agreement
with the galaxy velocity field on smaller scales. Fitting the predicted cluster
peculiar velocities to a dipole term, in the local group frame and within a
distance of $\sim 18000$ km/sec, we recover extremely well both the local group
velocity and direction, in disagreement with the Lauer \& Postman (1994)
observation. However, we find a $\sim 6\%$ probability that their observed
velocity field could be a realization of our corresponding one, if the latter
is convolved with their large distance dependent errors. Our predicted cluster
bulk velocity amplitude agrees well with that deduced by the POTENT and the da
Costa et al. (1995) analyses of observed galaxy motions at $\sim 5000 - 6000$
km/sec; it decreases thereafter while at the Lauer \& Postman limiting depth
($\sim 15000$ km/sec) its amplitude is $\sim 150$ km/sec, in comfortable
agreement with most cosmological models.

have the resonating-valence-bond state as the exact ground state. The
correlation functions are evaluated exactly using the transfer matrix method
for the geometric representations of the valence-bond states. In this method,
we only treat matrices with small dimensions. This enables us to give
analytical results. It is shown that the correlation functions decay
exponentially with distance. The result suggests that there is a finite
excitation gap, and that the ground state is insulating. Since the
corresponding non-interacting systems may be insulating or metallic, we can say
that the gap originates from strong correlation. The persistent currents of the
present models are also investigated and found to be exactly vanishing.

nonperturbative quantization which is suitable for describing a phase of
quantum gravity characterized by states which are normalizable in the measure

cosmological constant. The Mandelstam identities are extended to a set of
relations which are governed by the Kauffman bracket so that the spin network
basis is deformed to a basis of SU(2)q spin networks. Corrections to the
actions of operators in non-perturbative quantum gravity may be readily
computed using recoupling theory; the example of the area observable is treated
here. Finally, eigenstates of the q-deformed Wilson loops are constructed,
which may make possible the construction of a q-deformed connection
representation through an inverse transform.

translation on $T^2$. The Calabi-Yau orbifolds so obtained have non-zero Euler
numbers, so quantum corrections exist on the type IIA strings. The heterotic

of $N^{-1/2}$ for the function of N arguments which is a solution to the Cauchy
problem for the equation of a special type. Many-particle Wigner,
Schr\""{o}dinger and Liouville equations for a system of a large number of
particles are of this type, when the external potential is of order O(1), while
the coefficient of the particle interaction potential is 1/N; the potentials
can be arbitrary smooth bounded functions. We apply this method to equations
for N-particle states corresponding to the N-th tensor power of an abstract
Hamiltonian algebra of observables. In particular, we show for the case of
multiparticle Schr\""{o}dinger-like equations that the property of N-particle
wave function to be approximately equal at large N to the product of
one-particle wave functions does not conserve under time evolution, while the
same property for the correlation functions of the finite order is known to
conserve(such hypothesis being the quantum analog of the chaos conservation
hypothesis put forward by M.Kac in 1956 was proved by the analysis of the
BBGKY-like hierarchy of equations). In order to find a leading asymptotics for
the N-particle wave function, one should use not only the solution to the well-
known Hartree equation being derivable from the BBGKY approach but also the
solution to another (Riccati-type) equation presented in this paper. We also
consider another interesting case when one adds to the N-particle system under
consideration one more particle interacting with the system with the
coefficient of the interaction potential of order O(1).It happens that in this
case one should investigate not a single Hartree-like equation but a set of
such equations, and the chaos will not conserve even for the correlators.
