structure, showing that the dynamical structure of young galaxies is changed by
relaxation of a stellar system formed by a starburst-driven outflowing gas
(superwind). When a superwind interacts with halo gas, an expanding dense
supershell of shocked gas is formed. Using a similarity solution for the
expanding shell and a condition for the gravitational instability of a gaseous
shell, we show that an expanding gaseous shell with a mass of several $10^{10}
M_\odot$ and a radius of several kpc becomes gravitationally unstable to form
stars. A stellar shell is thus formed, relaxes and will evolve into a fat
stellar system. \par In order to investigate the fate of the stellar shell and
its dynamical influence on the host galaxy, we performed three dimensional
$N$-body simulations of a stellar shell plus disk system. The evolution of the
stellar shell was computed under two types of environment: an external
flattened potential and a live stellar disk. We find that the relaxation
process and resultant structure are significantly affected by the external disk
potential, and also depend on the velocity dispersion of the initial shell
stars and the mass of the shell. The final galactic structure ranges from a
thick disk and a compact bulge with a high density core to a thin disk with a
diffuse bulge. Isodensity maps of the computed disk plus bulge system resemble
isophotes of S0 galaxies. We suggest that the effects of primeval starbursts
would explain some observational properties of S0 galaxies.

acceleration, which we suggest can explain most of the observed cosmic rays of
the nuclei of Helium and heavier elements, from GeV in particle energies up to
near $3 \, 10^9$ GeV, as well as electrons above about 30 GeV. We go through
the following steps:
  1) Using a postulated underlying principle that leads to transport
coefficients in a turbulent plasma, we derive the properties of energetic
particles accelerated in spherical shocks.
  2) We suggest that a dynamo working in the inner convection zone of an upper
main sequence star can lead to high magnetic field strengths.
  3) Such magnetic fields may put additional momentum into stellar winds from
the pressure gradient of the toroidal field.
  4) We derive a lower limit for the magnetic field strengths.

injection. With this concept we propose an explanation for the observed
proton/electron ratio in galactic cosmic rays at GeV energies.

an external shear field. The best fit de Vaucouleurs model has an effective
radius of R_e = 0.83+-0.13 arcseconds, larger than that measured at optical
wavelengths. The best fit ``alpha model'' has alpha=0.6+-0.2 and a core radius
of s = 0.19 +- 0.07 arcseconds. An isothermal model (alpha=1) is inconsistent
with the data. The best alpha model fits the 8 GHz map significantly better
than the best de Vaucouleurs model. Although it is difficult to distinguish
visually the original image and the reconstructions, none of the models is
statistically consistent with the data. We believe the primary problem is that
an external shear is an inadequate model for the angular structure of the lens
galaxy. The finite core radius in the models is required by the structure of
the extended ring, so we confirm that the central component in the 8 GHz map is
a central, lensed image of the source rather than the lens galaxy. The model
lens positions, the position angle of the shear, and the mass interior to the
ring are determined very precisely by the lens models. The time delay between
the compact components is predicted with an uncertainty we estimate to be at
most +- 9%; the formal uncertainty is +- 4%.

eliminate the need for a non-immediate dominance relation in the descriptions

energy-momentum conservation law in order to analize that in gravitation
theory. In Lagrangian field theory, we get different identities involving
different stress energy-momentum tensors which however are not conserved,
otherwise in the covariant multimomentum Hamiltonian formalism. In the
framework of this formalism, we have the fundamental identity whose restriction
to a constraint space can be treated the energy-momentum transformation law.
This identity remains true also for gravity. Thus, the tools are at hand to
investigate the energy-momentum conservation laws in gravitation theory. The
key point consists in the feature of a metric gravitational field whose
canonical momenta on the constraint space are equal to zero.
