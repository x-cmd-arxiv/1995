anisotropy and polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR)
in the standard CDM model. We separate three cases in which the anisotropy is
induced by pure scalar, pure tensor, and mixed metric perturbations
respectively. It is found that, if reionization occurs early enough, the
polarization can reach a detectable level of sequentially $6\%$, $9\%$, and
$6.5\%$ of the anisotropy. In general, a higher degree of polarization implies
a dominant contribution from the tensor mode or reionization at high redshift.
Since early reionization will suppress small-scale CMBR anisotropies and
polarizations significantly, measuring the polarization on few degree scales
can be a direct probe of the reionization history of the early universe.

  263-286",,,"cs.AI",,"  Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown
function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k &gt 2 values (i.e., k
``classes''). The definition is acquired by studying collections of training
examples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning
problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the
decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning
algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and
application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output
representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique
in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output
representation. We show that these output representations improve the
generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of
multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust
with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of
distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of
overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we
show that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can
provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results
demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method
for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass
problems.

  319-360",,,"cs.AI",,"  The paradigms of transformational planning, case-based planning, and plan
debugging all involve a process known as plan adaptation - modifying or
repairing an old plan so it solves a new problem. In this paper we provide a
domain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound,
complete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the
literature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of
partial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves from
node to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a
library plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for
the search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same
refinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract
constraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm's completeness ensures that
the adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its
systematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any
parts of the graph.

  287-318",,,"cs.AI",,"  Temporal difference (TD) methods constitute a class of methods for learning
predictions in multi-step prediction problems, parameterized by a recency
factor lambda. Currently the most important application of these methods is to
temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement
learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of
TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general
implementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement
learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional
approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both
inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences)
procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates
TD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used
with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is
derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far.
Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda
&gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning
speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.

show significant enhancement either in the inclusive $b\rightarrow c$ decays or
in the exclusive amplitudes at zero recoil provided that the expansion
parameter is chosen in a way appropriate to the kinematics at hand. The values
of the second-order coefficients inferred from the BLM-type calculations appear
to be of order unity in the both cases. Thus, in both cases no significant
uncertainty in extracting $V_{cb}$ can be attributed to perturbative effects.
The theoretical accuracy is mostly determined by the existing uncertainty in
$1/m_c^2$ nonperturbative corrections in the exclusive $B\rightarrow D^*$
amplitude, and, to a lesser extent, by the uncertainty in the estimated value
of the kinetic energy matrix element $\mu_\pi^2$ in the case of $\Gamma_{\rm

determination of $V_{cb}$ seemingly competes with and even exceeds the
experimental accuracy.
