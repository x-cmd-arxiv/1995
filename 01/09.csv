surrounding 36 of the 66 stars examined. Some of these stars have lower outflow

velocity of the ejected material was 7.0 km/sec, about half the value found in
Miras selected by infrared criteria. None of the stars with spectral types
earlier than M 5.5 were detected. The terminal velocity increases as the
temperature of the stellar photosphere decreases, as would be expected for a
radiation driven wind. Mass loss rates for the detected objects were
calculated, and it was found that there is no correlation between the infrared
color of a Mira variable, and its mass loss rate. The mass loss rate is
correlated with the far infrared luminosity, although a few stars appear to
have extensive dust envelopes without any detectable molecular wind. A
power-law relationship is found to hold between the mass loss rate and the
terminal velocity of the ejected material. This relationship indicates that the
dust envelope should be optically thick in the near infrared and visible
regions of the spectrum when the outflow velocity is > 17 km/sec. At the low
end of the range of outflow velocities seen, the dust drift velocity may be
high enough to lead to the destruction of the grains via sputtering. Half of
the stars which were detected were re-observed in the CO(4-3) transition. A
comparison of the outflow velocities obtained from these observations with
those obtained by other investigators at lower frequencies shows no evidence

show that, provided that the nucleus of a fragment is composed substantially of
silicates and has a diameter greater than about 0.4 km, dust in the required

ejected from the site where the fragment entered, and the dust will be
suspended in the stratosphere for long periods. Particles about 1$\;\mu$m in

bias of the IRAS selected galaxies relative to the mass fluctuations. We review
the status of these large scale flow measurements and present a new methodology
to describe the two fields by means of an expansion in a set of orthogonalized

tunneling. If the resistance is lower, quantum fluctuations, higher order
coherent processes, and eventually resonant tunneling become important. We
present a path integral real-time approach, which allows a systematic

``inelastic resonant tunneling'', where different electrons tunnel coherently

the average charge on the island can be deduced. We find a strong

candidate action functionals $S_1$,\dots $S_8$ as possible generalizations of
general relativity and investigate to what extent each of these defines a
sensible variational problem, and which junction condition is implied. Four of
the actions involve an integration over the total manifold. A particular
subtlety arises from the precise definition of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian

integrals over singe-signature domains. The result is that {\it both} types of

first principles, none of which can be claimed to represent the ''correct''
one, unless physical predictions are taken into account. From a point of view
of naturality dictated by the variational formalism, {\it weak} signature
change is slightly favoured over {\it strong} one, because it requires less

dynamics of the transverse gluonic degrees of freedom. The ""bare"" gluons
interact with each other to form a collective excitation, the Reggeon. The
partial waves of the scattering amplitude satisfy the Bethe-Salpeter equation
whose solutions describe the color singlet compound states of Reggeons --

subgroup of $G^c$ that leaves the order parameter invariant. The lagrangian may
also contain additional light matter fields. To analyze the effective
lagrangian for the matter fields, we first consider the case where the
effective lagrangian is obtained by integrating out heavy modes at weak
coupling (but including non-perturbative effects such as instantons). We show
that the superpotential of the matter fields is $\hat{H}$ invariant, which can
give rise to non-trivial relations among independent $H$-invariants in the
superpotential. We also show that the Kahler potential of the matter fields can

in view of the astonishing theorem by Khalfin on the possibility of vacuum
regeneration of $K_S$ and $K_L$. The main reason for this unexpected behaviour
is the non-orthogonality of $\ks$ and $\kl$. As a result of this theorem new
contributions to the well known oscillatory terms will enter the time dependent
transition probabilities. These new terms are not associated with small/large
time behaviour of the amplitudes and therefore their magnitude is apriori
unknown. Approximating the spectral functions by an one-pole ansatz Khalfin
estimated the new effect in transition probabilities to be $4 \times 10^{-4}$.
Whereas we agree with Khalfin on the general existence of vacuum regeneration
of $K_S$ and $K_L$ we disagree on the size of the effect. A careful analysis of
the one-pole approximation reveals that the effect is eleven orders of
magnitude smaller than Khalfin's estimate and, in principle, its exact
determination lies outside the scope of the one-pole ansatz. The present paper
gives also insight into the limitation of the validity of one-pole
approximation, not only for small/large time scales, but also for intermediate
times where new effects, albeit small, are possible. It will be shown that the

then study a number of improved approximants for the perturbative series, based

Super-Kamiokande), in which high-energy $^8\mathrm{B}$ neutrinos will be
detected, it will be possible in a model independent way: 1) To reveal the
presence of sterile neutrinos in the flux of solar neutrinos on the earth; 2)
To obtain the initial flux of $^8\mathrm{B}$ $\nu_e$'s; 3) To determine the
probability of $\nu_e$'s to survive as a function of neutrino energy.

$G$ compactified on a two-torus is governed by an effective superconformal
field theory. We conjecture that this is a certain orbifold involving the
maximal torus of $G$. Yang-Mills $S$-duality makes predictions for all
correlators of this effective conformal field theory. These predictions are
shown to be implied by the standard $T$-duality of the conformal field theory.
Consequently, Montonen-Olive duality between electric and magnetic states
reduces to the standard two-dimensional duality between momentum and winding
states.

a preassigned point of the spherical partial sums of the Fourier integral in a
class of piecewise smooth functions in Euclidean space. These yield elementary
examples of divergent Fourier integrals in three dimensions and higher.
Meanwhile, several years ago Gottlieb and Orsag observed that in two dimensions
we may expect slower convergence at certain points, specifically for
Fourier-Bessel series of radial functions.
  In this paper we investigate the rate of convergence of the spherical partial
sums of the Fourier integral for a class of piecewise smooth functions. The
basic result is an asymptotic expansion which allows us to read off the rate of
convergence at a pre-assigned point.
