that, necessary and sufficient conditions of stability are obtained when we
have only two mode coupling in the gyroscopic terms of the perturbed
Lagrangian. To illustrate the power of this new energy principle, I have
calculated the stability limits of two dimensional configurations such as
ordinary Maclaurin disk, an infinite self gravitating rotating sheet, and a two
dimensional Rayleigh flow which has well known sufficient conditions of
stability. All perturbations considered are in the same plane as the
configurations. The limits of stability are identical with those given by a
dynamical analysis when available, and with the results of the strong energy
principle analysis when given. Thus although the ""Weak Energy"" method is
mathematically more simple than the ""Strong Energy"" method of Katz, Inagaki and

differential equations, it is by no means less effective.

dwarf galaxies dominated by a very luminous starburst, have indicated that
luminous HII galaxies tend to show distorted morphology suggestive of tidal
interactions triggering the present starburst while low luminosity HII galaxies
tend to be instead symmetric and regular. To check the tidal origin of the
starburst in HII galaxies, we have searched for companions in the neighbourhood
of a sample of 51 HII galaxies. We found that only 12 HII galaxies have a
neighbour within a projected distance of 1 Mpc and 250 \kmsec~ in velocity
difference, and of these 12, only 4 have a luminous (M$_B <$ --19) neighbour.
Surprisingly, isolated HII galaxies tend to be of high luminosity and disturbed
morphology while HII galaxies with neighbours tend to be low luminosity regular
HII galaxies. Furthermore, the metal abundance and the equivalent width of the
emission lines in HII galaxies do not depend on the presence of a companion.
These results are opposed to simple expectations if interaction with a bright
companion is the main mechanism triggering the starbursts. We have also found a
loose group of HII galaxies with no luminous companion. For this, there is the
additional difficulty of understanding how these starbursts are synchronized on
time scales of less than $10^7$ yrs in systems separated by $\sim$ 1-2 Mpc.

$\phi^4$ theory, in cylindrical geometry, allows one to obtain the partition
function of the interface separating coexisting phases. The quantum
fluctuations of the interface around its equilibrium position are described by
a $c=1$ two--dimensional conformal field theory, namely a 2D free massless
scalar field living on the interface. In this way the capillary wave model
conjecture for the interface free energy in its gaussian approximation is
proved.

surface with branch points (orbifold) depends only on the genus and the number
of special points, but not on the particular ramification values. On the other
hand, the Maskit embedding provides a mapping from the Teichm\""{u}ller space of
an orbifold, into the product of one dimensional Teichm\""{u}ller spaces. In
this paper we prove that there is a set of isomorphisms between one dimensional
Teichm\""{u}ller spaces that, when restricted to the image of the
Teichm\""{u}ller space of an orbifold under the Maskit embedding, provides the
Bers-Greenberg isomorphism.

n,m = {1,2,3} are randomly selected. We find that while the band gap of the
equivalent (n = m = 2) ordered superlattice is indirect, random fluctuations in
layer thicknesses lead to a direct gap in the planar Brillouin zone, strong
wavefunction localization along the growth direction, short radiative
lifetimes, and a significant band-gap reduction, in agreement with experiments
on such intentionally grown disordered superlattices.

counterexamples to the axiom of choice motivate the investigation of peculiar
constructions, e.g. an infinite dimensional Hilbert space with a modular
quantum logic. Applying a concept due to BENIOFF, we identify the intrinsically
effective Hamiltonians with those observables of quantum theory which may
coexist with a failure of the axiom of choice. Here a self adjoint operator is
intrinsically effective, iff the Schroedinger equation of its generated
semigroup is soluble by means of eigenfunction series expansions.
