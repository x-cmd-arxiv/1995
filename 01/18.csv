sources of temperature fluctuations produced by time-varying potentials: (1)
anisotropies due to intrinsic changes in the gravitational potentials of the
inhomogeneities and (2) anisotropies generated by the peculiar, bulk motion of
the structures across the microwave sky. Both effects generate CMB anisotropies
in the range of $10^{-7} \siml \Delta T/T \siml 10^{-6}$ on scales of $ \sim

a dipole-like signature in the CMB sky that in principle could yield

transition point $h=h_t$, we prove that the low temperature finite volume
magnetization $m_{\free}(L,h)$ per site in a cubic volume of size $L^d$ behaves

  $m_\free(L,h)=\frac{m_++m_-}2 + \frac{m_+-m_-}2

proportional to $1/L$ with respect to the infinite volume transitions point
$h_t$ provided the surface free energies of the two phases at the transition
point are different. This should be compared with the shift for periodic boun\-
dary conditons, which for an asymmetric transition with two coexisting phases
is proportional only to $1/L^{2d}$. One also consider the position $h_U(L)$ of
the maximum of the so called Binder cummulant $U_\free(L,h)$. While it is again
shifted by an amount proportional to $1/L$ with respect to the infinite volume
transition point $h_t$, its shift with respect to $h_\chi(L)$ is of the much
smaller order $1/L^{2d}$. We give explicit formulas for the proportionality

because \ddot a = b is one of the canonical equations. Another canonical
equation becomes equivalent to the fourth-order Euler-Lagrange equation of L.
Usually, H becomes quadratic in the momenta, whereas the Ostrogradski approach
has Hamiltonians always linear in the momenta. For non-linear L=F(R), G=dF/dR

class-sum, $[(2)]_n$, of $S_n$ when $q\rightarrow 1$. The projection operators
constructed in terms of $C_n$ for the various irreps of $H_n(q)$ are
well-behaved in the limit $q\rightarrow 1$, even when approaching degenerate

not fully characterized by the corresponding eigenvalue of the transposition

It is a universal description of a broad class of measurement interactions, and
its physical implications are unambiguous.

of the complementarity principle, an application of EPR correlations for
dispersion-free time-measurements, and an experiment to demonstrate the
superluminal nature of the tunneling process. The nonlocal character of the
quantum world is brought out clearly by these experiments. As we explain,
however, quantum nonlocality is not inconsistent with Einstein causality.

of papers, (some of them in collaboration with I.Schmelzer and I.Taimanov)
dedicated to the development of the analog of Morse theory for the closed
1-forms -- multivalued functions and functionals -- on the finite - and
infinite-dimensional manifolds ({\bf Morse-Novikov Theory}).
  The notion of ``Multivalued action'' was understood and ``Topological
quantization of the coupling constant'' for them was formulated by Novikov in
1981 as a Corollary from the requirement, that the Feinmann Amplitude should be
one-valued on the space of fields-maps. Very beautiful analog of this theory
appeared also in the late 80-ies in the Symplectic Geometry and Topology, when
the so-called Floer Homology Theory was discovered. A very first topological
idea of this theory, formulated in early 80-ies, was the so-called ``Principle
of the Overthrowing of the Cycles''. It led to the results which were not
proved rigorously until now. Our goal is to prove some of them.
  We study the motion of a classical charged particle on the Euclidean plane in
a magnetic field orthogonal to this field. The trajectories of this motion can
be characterized as extremals of the ``Maupertui--Fermat'' functional. We show
that for any smooth everyvhere positive double periodic magnetic field for any
fixed energy there exist at least two different periodic convex extremals, such
that the value of the Maupertui-Fermat functional is positive for them. If all
such extremals are nondegenerate in the sense of Morse in the space of
nonparameterized curves then for any energy there exist at least 4 periodic
convex extremals with the Morse indices (1,2,2,3).
