the dark matter in clusters of galaxies. ICMs can be detected by searching
toward M87 for ``pixel lensing'', gravitational microlensing of unresolved
stars. Dedicated observations by the Wide Field and Planetary Camera on the
{\it Hubble Space Telescope} would discover lenses at a rate $\Gamma\sim 7
f\,\rm day^{-1}$ where $f$ is the fraction of the Virgo cluster composed of
Machos (Massive Compact Objects). The only important background is lensing by
stars in M87 itself. Such self-lensing should be detected at a rate $\Gamma\sim
1\,\rm day^{-1}$. However, most of these background events should be
recognizable from their angular distribution and/or measurement of their proper
motions (which are smaller by a factor $\sim 2$ than those of ICMs). The
observations should be carried out principally in $I$, but with $V$
measurements made $\sim 20\%$ of the time in order to determine the colors of
the lensed stars. It is also possible to detect ``Class II'' lensing events
which are longer and hence for which lower signal to noise is balanced by a
much larger number of observations per event. There are $\sim 5$ times more of
these than the higher quality events. However, it is difficult to distinguish
Class II events generated by ICMs from those generated by M87 stars.

consider alternative choices for the bosonic hopping operator and test them
