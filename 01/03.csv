convection is presented. The disk viscosity and the convective flux are derived
from a physical model for turbulence, and expressed in terms of the local
physical conditions of the disk which, in turn, are controlled by the former
two. In the gas pressure region, two distinct solutions are obtained. In one,
the convective flux is much larger than the radiative flux and the blackbody
region extends over the entire gas pressure region and could also extend down
to the inner boundary of the disk. In this solution the temperature profile is
close to adiabatic. In the other solution, the convective flux is about a third
of the total flux, and there exist the gas pressure blackbody and electron
scattering regions as well as the radiation pressure region. In the radiation
pressure region, the temperature profile is very close to adiabatic, and the
disk is geometrically thin and optically thick even for super Eddington
accretion rates. The fraction of the convective flux, out of the total flux,
increases with the accretion rate, and for accretion rates comparable to the
Eddington limit is close to 1. This variation stabilizes the, radiation
pressure region, so that the disk regions are secularily stable.

as ``Brownian'' motion of quarks (electrons). BRST-invariance allows us to
reduce the number of independent width parameters to three. These are
determined in a self-consistent way from the one-loop self energy and
polarization tensor in the infrared limit thus rendering this limit finite. All
spectral width parameters are found to be proportional to $g T$. We reproduce
the well known expression for the electric ``Debye''-screening mass. The
transverse (magnetic) gluons (photons) are found to interact only at nonzero
momentum or energy, at least to leading order. As a consequence their spectral
function acquires a width only away from the infrared limit. Finally, plasmon
modes are determined and found to be strongly damped.
