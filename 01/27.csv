  Astrophysical journal","Astrophys.J. 446 (1995) 292","10.1086/175788",,"astro-ph",,"  We present results of a model for the energetics of electrons accelerated by
the large electric fields generated by a rotating highly magnetized neutron
star. The energy loss mechanisms we consider in our calculations include
magnetic Compton scattering of thermal x-ray photons, triplet pair production,
and curvature radiation emission. The electron acceleration mechanism is
assumed to operate only to a height above the polar cap approximately equal to
the polar cap radius. We find several interesting results. First, magnetic
Compton scattering is the dominant energy loss process when the electron
Lorentz factors are < few x10^6 for typical gamma-ray pulsar magnetic fields
and surface temperatures measured by ROSAT. The amount of energy converted to
photons by accelerated electrons ranges from ~10% to ~100% of gamma_0 mc^2
where gamma_0 is the maximum Lorentz factor an electron can attain with no
radiative losses. We also find that if B > 10^13 G and T > 3x10^6 K, the
Lorentz factors of the electrons can be limited to values < 10^3 assuming
values for the size of the neutron star thermal polar cap comparable to the
polar cap size determined by the open field lines. Such small Lorentz factors
may be capable of explaining the gamma-ray emission from PSR 1509-58 which is
observed only at energies <1 MeV. We calculated the fraction of the electron's
kinetic energy that is converted to gamma rays for the three gamma-ray pulsars
which show thermal x-ray spectra, namely Vela (60%), Geminga (5%), and PSR
1055-52 (20%).

binary with a Be-star companion. Strongly time variable X-ray emission was
reported from this system as the pulsar was near apastron in 1992-early 1993.
The variability was primarily deduced from an apparent non-detection of the
\psr system during a first pre-apastron \ros observation in February~1992. We
have re-analyzed the \ros observations of the \psr system. Contrary to the
results of a previous analysis, we find that the \psr system was detected by
\ros during the first off-axis February~1992 observation. The intensity of the
soft X-ray emission of the \psr system before and after the 1992 apastron
appears to vary at most by a factor $\sim 2$. Our results sensibly constrain
theoretical models of X-ray emission from the \psr system.

of four fields in the globular cluster M13. The composite K, J-K
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) extends from the upper red giant branch (RGB) to
2 magnitudes below the main sequence turn-off (MSTO). Selected [Fe/H]~ -1.6
isochrones from Bergbusch & VandenBerg (1992, ApJS, 81, 163) and Straniero &
Chieffi (1991, ApJS, 76, 525) are transformed onto the near-infrared
observational plane, and these suggest an age for M13 in the range 14-16 Gyr.
We emphasize that any effort to estimate ages should be considered as tentative
given uncertainties in the input physics; however, these uncertainties
notwithstanding, comparisons between the near-infrared isochrones indicate that
age differences of order +/-2 Gyr should be detectable among metal-poor
clusters on the K, J-K plane. Building on this result, we find that the
difference in J-K color between the MSTO and the base of the RGB in M13 is the
same as in M4, and conclude that these clusters have similar ages. This
conclusion is verified by comparing (1) the K brightnesses of the MSTO, and (2)
the morphologies of optical CMDs. Finally, we investigate the mass function of
main sequence stars in M13 with distances between 3 and 6 core radii from the
cluster center. The mass functions in the interval 0.55 and 0.8 solar masses
are relatively flat, independent of radius. Optical studies at larger radii
have found non-zero mass function indices in this same mass interval, and we
attribute this radial variation in mass function morphology to dynamical
evolution.

arcs in the luminous X-ray cluster A2219 ($z=0.225$). The brighter arc in the
field is red and we use spectroscopic and photometric information to identify
it as a $z \sim 1$ moderately star-forming system. The brightness of this arc
implies that it is formed from two merging images of the background source, and
we identify possible candidates for the third image of this source. The second
giant arc in this cluster is blue, and while fainter than the red arc it has a
similarly large angular extent (32 arcsec). This arc comprises three images of
a single nucleated source -- the relative parities of the three images are
discernible in our best resolution images. The presence of several bright
multiply imaged arcs in a single cluster allows detailed modelling of the
cluster mass distribution, especially when redshift information is available.
We present a lensing model of the cluster which explains the properties of the
various arcs, and we contrast this model with the optical and X-ray information
available on the cluster. We uncover significant differences between the
distributions of mass and X-ray gas in the cluster. We suggest that such
discrepancies may indicate an on-going merger event in the cluster core,
possibly associated with a group around the second brightest cluster member.
The preponderance of similar merger signatures in a large fraction of the
moderate redshift clusters would indicate their dynamical immaturity.

low mass X-ray binary (LMXRB) 4U1957+11. The 1-20keV spectrum of the source is
best fitted by a power law model with exponential cutoff, that provides an
approximation of a thermal Comptonisation spectrum. The cutoff energy (~2keV),
as well as the X-ray colours, are intermediate between those of ultrasoft
sources containing black hole candidates (BHCs) and those of soft LMXRBs
containing an old accreting neutron star. We find no evidence for a black body
spectral component. During the 1985 observation, the source flux was 10% higher
than in the 1983 observation, and the ME spectra provide evidence for a high
energy tail (up to ~16keV), which strengthens the similarity with the spectra
of high state BHCs. However the source luminosity was only ~5 10^36 ergs/s.
During the 1985 observation the GSPC spectra revealed the presence of a 100eV
EW iron K-line emission feature with a centroid energy of 7.06+/-0.09keV; this
value is among the highest measured by {\it EXOSAT}. The ME light curves showed
only a low-amplitude variability on timescales of a few hours. No evidence for
a periodic modulation with periods between 0.016 and 13000~s was found.

performing the multipole expansion of bare Coulomb matrix elements. For

instability in conducting narrow band systems proceeds by a common softening of
one transverse and one longitudinal mode. Furthermore, the self-polarization

conformal weight $\lambda=1$ defined on a general closed and orientable Riemann
surface. The advantage of our approach is that the Riemann surface is
represented as an affine algebraic curve. In this way it is possible to perform
explicit calculations in string theory at any perturbative order. Besides the
obvious applications in string theories and conformal field theories, (the
$b-c$ systems at $\lambda=1$ are intimately related to the free scalar field
theory), the operator formalism presented here sheds some light also on the
quantization of field theories on Riemann surfaces. In fact, we are able to
construct explicitly the vacuum state of the $b-c$ systems and to define
creation and annihilation operators. All the amplitudes are rigorously computed
using simple normal ordering prescriptions as in the flat case.

the standard droplet theory of homogeneous nucleation problematic. A
self-consistent coarse-graining procedure is introduced to overcome this
difficulty, and the barrier height for nucleation of a critical droplet is
estimated in the weak-coupling limit. Contrary to earlier estimates the
critical droplet shape is shown to be anisotropic in general. Some effects of
distortions and defects in the lamellar structure are considered and are shown
to affect the critical droplet only very near coexistence where the probability
of nucleation vanishes. The coarse-graining procedure introduced here follows
from a novel application of the momentum-shell renormalization group method to
systems in the Brazovskii class. Possible applications of the theory to the
microphase separation transition in diblock copolymers and to
Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection are briefly discussed.
