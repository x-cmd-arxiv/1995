galaxies. These LSB galaxies follow the same Tully-Fisher relation as normal
spiral galaxies. This implies that the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of LSB
galaxies is typically a factor of 2 larger than that of normal galaxies of the
same total luminosity and morphological type. Since the dynamical mass of a
galaxy is related to the rotation velocity and scale length via M \propto V^2
h, at fixed linewidth LSB galaxies must be twice as large as normal galaxies.
This is confirmed by examining the relation between scale length and linewidth
for LSB and normal galaxies. The universal nature of the Tully-Fisher relation
can be understood if LSB galaxies are galaxies with low mass surface density,
\sigma. The mass surface density apparently controls the luminosity evolution
of a galaxy such as to keep the product \sigma M/L constant.

Previous predictions of reentrance are found to fail due to an overestimation

transition from zero to finite mobility may occur at finite temperature.

from the momentum scales $T$ and $gT$, respectively. The first term can be

renormalization group equations that can be used to sum up leading logarithms

model of Alvarez-Gaume, Itoyama, Manes and Zadra is given. By a change of
variables from coupling constants to moments we find a compact form of the
planar solution for general potentials. In this framework an iterative scheme
for the calculation of higher genera contributions to the free energy and the
multi-loop correlators is developed. We present explicit results for genus one.

  modified as compared with the first version.",,,"DFTUZ /95 / 02","hep-th",,"  The fourth derivative models for two dimensional gravity are shown to be
equivalent to the special version of the nonlinear sigma models coupled to 2d
quantum gravity. The reduction consists in the introduction of the auxiliary
scalar fields and can be performed in an explicit way for both metric and
general metric-dilaton cases. In view of this we can evaluate the structure of
possible counterterms and show that they contains second derivative structures
only. The calculations in the theory with an auxiliary fields require some
special procedure to be applied. We perform the explicit calculations in a
different gauges and explore the features of the auxiliary fields.

schemes lead to divergent contributions, and to finite parts which do not
coincide. We determine the relationships among the various coefficients
appearing in one approach and the other. As an application, we discuss the case
of scalar fields in $d$-dimensional boxes under periodic boundary conditions.

Lorentz group does not act canonically, but instead as a Poisson-Lie group. In
so doing we obtain the classical limit of a particle moving on a noncommutative
space possessing $SL_q(2,C)$ invariance. We show that if the standard mass
shell constraint is chosen for the Hamiltonian function, then the particle
interacts with the space-time. We solve for the trajectory and find that it
originates and terminates at singularities.
