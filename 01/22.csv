first order method, and two second order methods using the total variation

higher Reynold's number will be achievable than presently possible with either
lattice gas automata or lattice Boltzmann approaches. The ideas being general,
the scheme is applicable to any discrete-velocity model, and to lattice gases

discrete-velocity gas, the nine-velocity gas, wherein the multiplicity of
speeds ensures nontrivial thermodynamics. Obtained as a solution of the model
Boltzmann equations, the procedure consists of tracking the shock as a
trajectory of a three dimensional dynamical system connecting an equilibrium
upstream state to an equilibrium downstream state. The two equilibria satisfy
the jump conditions obtained from the model Euler equations. Comparison of the
shock structure to that in a monatomic perfect gas, as given by the
Navier-Stokes equation, shows excellent agreement. The shock in the
nine-velocity gas has an overshoot in entropy alone, like in a monatomic gas.
The near-equilibrium flow technique for discrete-velocity gases (Nadiga \&
Pullin [2]), a kinetic flux-splitting method based on the local thermodynamic
equilibrium, is also seen to capture the shock structure remarkably well.

thermodynamic equilibrium in a finite volume allows us to investigate
numerically discrete-velocity gas flows. The procedure, outlined for a general
discrete-velocity gas, is used to simulate flows of the nine-velocity gas, a
simple two dimensional multiple-speed discrete-velocity gas, wherein a
multiplicity of speeds ensures nontrivial thermodynamics. After verifying the
linear wave limit and the non-linear steepening of wavefronts, the stability
and propagation of planar discontinuities in that model gas is studied. The
supersonic-subsonic requirement for the stable propagation of a discontinuity,
being kinematic in nature is the same in the model gas, as e.g., in a perfect
gas. However, the finiteness of the velocity space in the model gas does not
allow a translation of the above kinematic condition to the thermodynamic
requirement of increasing entropy across a compressive shock: a case of an
entropy decreasing compressive shock in the model gas is presented. Finally,
the interaction of various types of waves--shock waves, rarefactions and
contact surfaces--in the model gas are shown in a simulation of the shock tube
problem.

two-electron tunneling. Here we study processes of third and fourth order. We
estimate the order of magnitude for these processes and discuss their relevance

supercooled Lennard-Jones liquid. We find that at low temperatures the curves
for the mean squared displacement of a tagged particle for different
temperatures fall onto a master curve when they are plotted versus rescaled
time $tD(T)$, where $D(T)$ is the diffusion constant. The time range for which
these curves follow the master curve is identified with the $\alpha$-relaxation
regime of mode-coupling theory (MCT). This master curve is fitted well by a
functional form suggested by MCT. In accordance with idealized MCT, $D(T)$
shows a power-law behavior at low temperatures. The critical temperature of
this power-law is the same for both types of particle and also the critical
exponents are very similar. However, contrary to a prediction of MCT, these
exponents are not equal to the ones determined previously for the divergence of
the relaxation times of the intermediate scattering function [Phys. Rev. Lett.
{\bf 73}, 1376 (1994)]. At low temperatures the van Hove correlation function
(self as well as distinct part) shows hardly any sign of relaxation in a time
interval that extends over about three decades in time. This time interval can
be interpreted as the $\beta$-relaxation regime of MCT. From the investigation
of these correlation functions we conclude that hopping processes are not
important on the time scale of the $\beta$-relaxation for this system and for
the temperature range investigated. We test whether the factorization property
predicted by MCT holds and find that this is indeed the case for all
correlation functions investigated. The distance dependence of the critical
amplitudes are in qualitative accordance with the ones predicted by MCT for
some other mixtures. The non-gaussian parameter for the self part of the van

models like the string model are employed, or a thermal treatment based on
hadrons or quarks is applied. String models encounter problems due to high
string densities, thermal approaches are too simplistic considering only
average distributions, ignoring fluctuations. We propose a completely new
approach, providing a link between the two treatments, and avoiding their main
shortcomings: based on the string model, connected regions of high energy
density are identified for single events, such regions referred to as quark
matter droplets. Each individual droplet hadronizes instantaneously according
to the available n-body phase space. Due to the huge number of possible hadron
configurations, special Monte Carlo techniques have been developed to calculate
this disintegration.
