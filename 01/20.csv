$N_f$ ranging from 8 through 40 by the exact Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. Over
this range of $N_f$, chiral symmetry breaking is found to be strongly
correlated with the effective monopoles in the theory. For $N_f$ between 8 and
16 the chiral symmetry breaking and monopole percolation transitions are second
order and coincident. Assuming powerlaw critical behavior, the correlation
length exponent for the chiral transition is identical to that of monopole
percolation. This result supports the conjecture that monopole percolation
``drives"" the nontrivial chiral transition. For $N_f$ between 20 and 32, the
monopoles experience a first order condensation transition coincident with a
first order chiral transition. For $N_f$ as large as 40 both transitions are
strongly suppressed. The data at large $N_f (N_f \mathrel {\mathpalette \vereq

transition.

corrections to scaling are explained in the framework of perturbative QCD. For
testing the validity of the parton model, we consider the deep inelastic
electron scattering in a model in which the system electromagnetic current
operator explicitly satisfies relativistic invariance and current conservation.
Let the struck particle have the fraction $\xi$ of the total momentum in the
infinite momentum frame. Then it is shown that, due to binding of particles in
the system under consideration, the Bjorken variable $x$ no longer can be
interpreted as $\xi$, even in the Bjorken limit and in zero order of the
perturbation theory. We argue that, as a result, the data on deep inelastic

discuss the BRS symmetry underlying the effective action. We proceed to use
this BRS symmetry to discuss the perturbative renormalization of the theory and
show that perturbatively the procedure is equivalent to Landau gauge fixing.
This generalizes earlier results obtained in the Abelian case to the
non-abelian case and confirms the widely held believe that the Gribov problem
manifests itself on the non-perturbative level, while not affecting the
perturbative results. A relation between the gluon mass and gluon condensate in
QCD is obtained which yields a gluon mass consistent with other estimates for
values of the gluon condensate obtained from QCD sum rules.

that thermodynamic entropy of the singlet sector of the one dimensional matrix

underlying string theory. In the high temperature limit the ``exact''

thus implying an instability. We speculate that in a properly defined two
