Solar flare models invoke a variety of initial distributions of the primary
energy release over the particles of the flare plasma -- ie., the partition of
the energy between thermal and nonthermal components. It is suggested that,
while this partition can take any value as far as energy is concerned, the
entropy of a particle distribution may provide a useful measure of the
likelihood of its being produced for a prescribed total energy.
  The Gibbs' entropy is calculated for several nonthermal isotropic
distribution functions $f$, for a single particle species, and compared with
that of a Maxwellian, all distributions having the same total number and energy
of particles. Speculations are made on the relevance of some of the results to
the cosmic ray power-law spectrum, on their relation to the observed frequency
distribution of nonthermal flare hard X-ray spectrum parameters and on the
additional energy release required to achieve lower entropy $f$s.

(LSB) disk galaxies. These galaxies are generally late types, if they can be
sensibly classified at all. However, they are not dwarfs, being intrinsically
large and luminous.
  The morphology of LSB galaxies is discussed in terms of the physical
interpretation of the Hubble sequence. Galaxies with high contrast relative to
the sky background are subject to being more finely typed than those which
appear merely as fuzzy blobs on photographic plates. This causes the stages of
the Hubble sequence to be nonlinear in the sense that large morphological type
distinctions are made between high surface brightness spirals when only small
physical differences exist, and small morphological distinctions are made
between low surface brightness galaxies even when large physical differences
exist.
  Many LSB galaxies lack the old red disk conspicuous in higher surface
brightness spirals. Their morphology is strikingly similar in all bands from
$U$ to $I$, suggesting farily homogeneous stellar populations lacking a well
developed giant branch. These properties, together with their very blue colors,
suggest that LSB galaxies are relatively younger than their high surface
brightness counterparts. A few of these LSB galaxies appear to be very young
($\simlt 1$~Gyr), and as such may represent local examples of protogalaxies.

  Fields: An Asymptotic Analysis","Revtex 3.0, 36 pages, 7 compressed and uuencoded postscript figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.51.15329",,"cond-mat supr-con",,"  The linear response of a thin superconducting strip subjected to an applied
perpendicular time-dependent magnetic field is treated analytically using the
method of matched asymptotic expansions. The calculation of the induced current
density is divided into two parts: an ``outer'' problem, in the middle of the
strip, which can be solved using conformal mapping; and an ``inner'' problem
near each of the two edges, which can be solved using the Wiener-Hopf method.
The inner and outer solutions are matched together to produce a solution which
is uniformly valid across the entire strip, in the limit that the effective
screening length $\lambda_{\rm eff}$ is small compared to the strip width $2a$.
From the current density it is shown that the perpendicular component of the
magnetic field inside the strip has a weak logarithmic singularity at the edges
of the strip. The linear Ohmic response, which would be realized in a type-II
superconductor in the flux-flow regime, is calculated for both a sudden jump in
the magnetic field and for an ac magnetic field. After a jump in the field the
current propagates in from the edges at a constant velocity $v=0.772 D/d$ (with
$D$ the diffusion constant and $d$ the film thickness), rather than
diffusively, as it would for a thick sample. The ac current density and the
high frequency ac magnetization are also calculated. The long time relaxation
of the current density after a jump in the field is found to decay
exponentially with a time constant $\tau_{0} = 0.255 ad/D$. The method is
extended to treat the response of thin superconducting disks, and thin strips
with an applied current. There is generally excellent agreement between the
results of the asymptotic analysis and the recent numerical calculations by E.

function'' $l(\phi)$ in the action. We illustrate several black hole solutions
as examples. In particular, asymptotically flat double- and multiple- horizon
black hole solutions are obtained. One solution bears an interesting
resemblance to the $2D$ string-theoretic black hole and contains the same
thermodynamic properties; another resembles the $4D$ Reissner-Nordstrom
solution. We find two characteristic features of all the black hole solutions.
First the coupling constants in $l(\phi)$ must be set equal to constants of
integration (typically the mass). Second, the spectator field $\psi$ and its
derivative $\psi^{'}$ both diverge at any event horizon. A test particle with
``spectator charge"" ({\it i.e.} one coupled either to $\psi$ or $\psi^{'}$),
will therefore encounter an infinite tidal force at the horizon or an
``infinite potential barrier'' located outside the horizon respectively. We
also compute the Hawking temperature and entropy for our solutions. In $2D$

recently been found to coexist with nuclear matter inside neutron stars in a
uniform background of electrons. The microstructure of this mixed phase starts
out with a few quark matter droplets embedded in the nuclear matter but as the
density of droplets increase towards the center of the neutron star they merge
into rods, plates and other structures. The topology, size as well as Coulomb
and surface energies of these structures depend sensitively on the
quark/nuclear matter interface tension. A major fraction of the interior of
neutron stars could consist of matter in this new phase, which would provide
new mechanisms for glitches, cooling and supernovae.

decays is not ruled out by experimental data on $B \ra K(K^*) +
J/\Psi(\Psi^{'})$. The problem previously pointed out might be due to an
inadequate choice of hadronic form factors. Within the Isgur-Wise SU(2) heavy
flavour symmetry framework, we search for possible $q^2$-dependences of form
factors that satisfy both the large longitudinal polarization $\rho_L$ observed
in $B \ra K^* + J/\Psi$ and the relatively small ratio of rates $R_{J/\Psi} =
\Gamma(B \ra K^* + J/\Psi)/\Gamma(B \ra K + J/\Psi)$. We find out that the
puzzle could be essentially understood if the $A_1(q^2)$ form factor is frankly
decreasing (instead of being almost constant or increasing as commonly
assumed). Of course, the possibility of understanding experimental data is not
necessarily a proof of factorization.

achieved by writing the complete list of the $SU(3)_c\times SU(2) \times U(1) $

the third family and/or bosons. The quark ~containing operators are divided
into two classes, according to whether they involve the $t_R$ field or not.
Each class contains 14 quark operators. We then proceed to derive the
constraints from present precision measurements, on the first class of the 14

allows to determine the general structure of the boundary perturbation
compatible with integrability. Then we analyze the situation at the quantum

examples. We find that, except for the sinh-Gordon model, the existence of
quantum conserved currents requires a finite renormalization of the boundary
potential.

into target superspace has its particular features. For instance, the embedding
may cause more rigid restrictions on the geometrical properties of the
supersurface. This is demonstrated with the examples of an N=1 twistor--like
supermembrane in D=11 and type II superstrings in D=10, where the
geometrodynamical condition causes the embedded supersurface to be minimal and
puts the theories on the mass shell.
