to be cosmic dark matter. Various procedures are considered in dependence on
the value of the axion mass.
  There are well known indications that a large part of the Universe mass
exists in a form of dark matter: The analysis of rotation curves of galaxies
leads to the conclusion that the mass of luminous matter is less than 1/10 part
of the total galaxies mass.
  The existence of the dark matter is supported by the so called ""virial
paradoxes"".
  It turns out that the reach and compact galaxies have unacceptible large
$\bar{\bf v^2}$ being in the same time stable with respect to anothers
characteristics. For such the galaxies to be stable their masses must be one
order greater than the observable ones.
  There are theoretical and observational arguments that this dark matter
cannot be usual barionic matter as dust, planets etc. On the other hand there
are attractive models where the dark matter is non-relativistic gas of light
elementary particles weakly interacting with the ""usual"" matter. Periodicity in
the distribution of quasars and distant galaxies with the red shift could be
naturally explained in the cosmology with a gas of very light (pseudo)Goldstone
bosons filling the Universe.
  It is well known that during a cooling an ideal Bose gas undergo the Bose
condensation. If the decoupling of axions has been enough early in the
cosmological evolution the axion gas should be in that moment of time in the
Bose condensate state.

retain only sub-curvature modes (defined as eigenfunctions of the Laplacian

Mathematicians have known for almost half a century that all modes must be
included to generate the most general HOMOGENEOUS GAUSSIAN RANDOM FIELD,
despite the fact that any square integrable FUNCTION can be generated using
only the sub-curvature modes. The former mathematical object, not the latter,
is the relevant one for physical applications. The mathematics is here
explained in a language accessible to physicists. Then it is pointed out that
if the perturbations originate as a vacuum fluctuation of a scalar field there
will be no super-curvature modes in nature. Finally the effect on the cmb of
any super-curvature contribution is considered, which generalizes to Omega<1
the analysis given by Grishchuk and Zeldovich in 1978. A formula is given,
which is used to estimate the effect. In contrast with the case Omega=1, the
effect contributes to all multipoles, not just to the quadrupole. It is
important to find out whether it has the same l dependence as the data, by
evaluating the formula numerically.

contributions to the superpotential. Our investigation also shows that
stationary points of the effective potential with negative vacuum energy do not
correspond to stationary solutions of the equations of postinflationary
cosmology. This suggests that supersymmetry breaking is a requirement for a
successful inflationary cosmology.

  Delocalization and Irreversibility","9 pages documentalstyle",,,"IASSNS-HEP/95/3","hep-th chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  Decoherence in quantum systems which are classically chaotic is studied. It
is well-known that a classically chaotic system when quantized loses many
prominent chaotic traits. We show that interaction of the quantum system with
an environment can under general circumstances quickly diminish quantum
coherence and reenact some characteristic classical chaotic behavior. We use
the Feynman-Vernon influence functional formalism to study the effect of an
ohmic environment at high temperature on two classically-chaotic systems: The
linear Arnold cat map (QCM) and the nonlinear quantum kicked rotor (QKR).
Features of quantum chaos such as recurrence in QCM and diffusion suppression
leading to localization in QKR are destroyed in a short time due to
environment-induced decoherence. Decoherence also undermines localization and
induces an apparent transition from reversible to irreversible dynamics in
quantum chaotic systems.

gravity. As a first step towards the full calculation, we concentrate on the
divergences which are proportional to the number of matter fields. We calculate
the $\beta$ functions and show how the nonlocal divergences as well as the
infrared divergences cancel among the diagrams. Although the formalism includes
a subtlety concerning the general covariance due to the dynamics of the
conformal mode, we find that the renormalization group allows the existence of
a fixed point which possesses the general covariance. Our results strongly
suggest that we can construct a consistent theory of quantum gravity by the
$\epsilon$ expansion around two dimensions.

\cite{LZ10} and {\it vertex operator algebras} \cite{Bor}\cite{FLM} is the
definition of the commutativity of a pair of quantum operators (see section 2
below). This is not commutativity in any ordinary sense, but it is clearly the
correct generalization to the quantum context. The main purpose of the current
paper is to begin laying the foundations for a complete mathematical theory of
{\it commutative quantum operator algebras.} We give proofs of most of the
relevant results announced in \cite{LZ10}, and we carry out some calculations
with sufficient detail to enable the interested reader to become proficient
with the algebra of commuting quantum operators.

vanishing theorem for this cohomology. For a certain commutative QOA attached
to a rank two hyperbolic lattice, we show that the degree one cohomology is
isomorphic to the so-called Lie algebra of physical states. In the case of a
rank two unimodular lattice, the degree one cohomology gives a new construction
of Borcherd's Monster Lie algebra. As applications, we compute the graded
dimensions and signatures of this cohomology as a hermitean Lie algebra graded
by a hyperbolic lattice. In the first half of this paper, we give as
preparations an exposition of the theory of quantum operator algebras. Some of
the results here were announced in lectures given by the first author at the

demonstrating a new topological phenomenon similar in principle to the usual

effect, follows from an ordinary local interaction, contrary to the usual AB
effect, and we argue that the SAB effect is not a topological effect by any
useful definition. We find that SAB actually measures an apparently novel spin
autocorrelation whose operator equations of motion contain the local torque in
the magnetic field. We note that the same remarks apply to the Aharonov-Casher
effect.
