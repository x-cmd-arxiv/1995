stellar contents resembling nearby elliptical galaxies. The BCGs in the
clusters EMSS0839+29, EMSS1455+22 and Abell2390 are complicated by ionized gas,
which is detected over large portions of all three systems. Radial color
variations are detected in the majority of galaxies and, for those systems not
showing extended [OII] emission, the weakening of D4000 (which measures the
4000 Angstrom break in magnitudes) with radius falls in the upper range of what
is seen among nearby ellipticals. However, there is no correlation between
local D4000 values and (g-r), suggesting that these quantities are sensitive to
different parameters. We estimate the metallicity sensitivity of D4000 using a
combination of observational and theoretical data, and find metallicity
gradients for BCGs which are relatively steep, and in qualitative agreement
with predictions for galaxies which experience a single monolithic dissipative
collapse. Line gradients measured with respect to g surface brightness show
excellent galaxy-to-galaxy consistency, and are in good agreement with what has
been measured in Coma cluster galaxies. The presence of significant stellar
population gradients in the BCGs suggests that the material from which they
formed experienced dissipation during the collapse phases, and it seems likely
that these galaxies could not have formed solely from the merging of gas-poor
galaxies.

Initial Gaussian random density perturbations with a power-law spectrum $P(k)

and thermodynamical quantities for different spectral indices $n$ and discuss
the statistical properties of clustering in the corresponding simulations. At
large scales the final distribution of the two components is very similar while
at small scales the dark matter presents a lumpiness which is not found in the
baryonic matter. The amplitude of density fluctuations in each component
depends on the spectral index $n$ and only for $n=-1$ the amplitude of baryonic
density fluctuations is larger than that in the dark component. This result is
also confirmed by the behaviour of the bias factor, defined as the ratio
between the r.m.s of baryonic and dark matter fluctuations at different scales:
while for $n=1,\ 3$ it is always less than unity except at very large scales
where it tends to one, for $n=-1$ it is above 1.4 at all scales. All
simulations show also that there is not an exact correspondence between the
positions of largest peaks in dark and baryonic components, as confirmed by a
cross-correlation analysis. The final temperatures depend on the initial
spectral index: the highest values are obtained for $n=-1$ and are in proximity
of high density regions.

oscillations and an adiabatic separation of quark and flux tube motion. We find
that the small oscillation approximation is inappropriate for typical hadrons
and that the hybrid mass is underestimated by the adiabatic approximation. For
physical parameters in the ``one-bead"" flux tube model we estimate the lightest
hybrid masses (${}_\Lambda L = {}_1 P$ states) to be 1.8-1.9~GeV for $u\bar u$
hybrids, 2.1-2.2~GeV for $s\bar s$ and 4.1-4.2~GeV for $c\bar c$. We also
determine masses of conventional $q\bar q$ mesons with $L=0$ to $L=3$ in this
model, and confirm good agreement with experimental $J$-averaged multiplet
masses. Mass estimates are also given for hybrids with higher orbital and
flux-tube excitations. The gap from the lightest hybrid level (${}_1P$) to the

  Problems, Dubna, 1994, October","hep-ph",,"  Processes of hevy quark photoproduction at HERA energies and beyond are
investigated using the semihard ($k_{\bot}$ factorization) approach. The
virtuality and longitudinal polarization of gluons in the photon - gluon
subprocess as well as the saturation effects in the gluon distribution function
at small $x$ have been taken into account. The total cross sections, rapidity
and $p_{\bot}$ distributions of the charm and beauty quark photoproduction have
been calculated. We obtained the some differences between the predictions of
the standard parton model and the semihard approach used here.

of on-shell diagrams, several of which involve a generalized Coleman-Thun

a unique functional of the periodic density change~: it depends also on the
change in the macroscopic {\em polarization}. Moreover, the dependence of the
exchange-correlation energy on polarization induces an exchange-correlation
electric field. These effects are exhibited for a model semiconductor. We also
show that the scissor-operator technique is an approximate way of bypassing
this polarization dependence.

understand the source of differences between non-relativistic and relativistic
models. We perform an effective Pauli reduction on the relativistic expression
for the S-matrix in the one-photon exchange approximation. The reduction is
applied to the nucleon current only; the electrons are treated fully
relativistically. An expansion of the amplitude results in a power series in
the nuclear potentials. The series is found to converge rapidly only if the
nuclear potentials are included in the nuclear current operator. The results
can be cast in a form which reproduces the non-relativistic amplitudes in the
limit that the potentials are removed from the nuclear current operator. Large
differences can be found between calculations which do and do not include the
nuclear potentials in the different orders of the nuclear current operator. In
the high missing momentum region we find that the non-relativistic calculations
with potentials included in the nuclear current up to second order give results
which are close to those of the fully relativistic calculation. This behavior
is an indication of the importance of the medium modifications of the nuclear
currents in this model, which are naturally built into the relativistic
treatment of the reaction.

described in terms of a density matrix, {\it even when $\s$ in not
post-selected}. However, a simple description in terms of a two-state (TS) is
always available. The two-state of $\s$ evolves in time from an initially
`pure' TS to a `mixed' TS and back to a final `pure' TS. This generic process
is governed by a modified Liouville equation, which is derived. For a sub-class
of observables, which can still be described by an ordinary density matrix,
this evolution generates recoherence to a final pure state. In some cases
post-selection can even suppress any decoherence.
