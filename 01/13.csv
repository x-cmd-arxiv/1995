of the light (heavy) $B_s$ mass eigenstate. It is demonstrated that decay
length distributions of some \underline{untagged} $B_s$ modes, such as $\rho^0
K_S, \; D_s^{(*)\pm}K^{(*)\mp}$, can be used to extract the notoriously
difficult CKM unitarity triangle angle $\gamma$. Sizable CP violating effects
may be seen with such untagged $B_s$ data samples. Listing $\Delta\Gamma$ as an
observable allows for additional important standard model constraints. Within
the CKM model, the ratio $\Delta\Gamma/ \Delta m$ involves no CKM parameters,
only a QCD uncertainty. Thus a measurement of $\Delta\Gamma \;(\Delta m)$ would
predict $\Delta m \;(\Delta\Gamma )$, up to the QCD uncertainty. A large width
difference would automatically solve the puzzle of the number of charmed
hadrons per $B$ decay in favor of theory. We also derive an upper limit of $(|
\Delta\Gamma | / \Gamma)_{B_s} <~ 0.3$. Further, we must abandon the notion of
branching fractions of $B_s\rightarrow f$, and instead consider $
B(B^0_{L(H)}\rightarrow f)$, in analogy to the neutral kaons.

of the dynamics of the correlation functions are investigated. We show how the
Dyson - Schwinger equations may be derived from a formal action functional, the

It is related to the decoherence functional between histories defined in terms
of correlations. Upon truncation of the Dyson - Schwinger hierarchy at a
certain order, the master effective action becomes complex, its imaginary part
arising from the higher order correlation functions, the fluctuations of which
we define as the correlation noises of that order. Decoherence of correlation
histories via these noises gives rise to classical stochastic histories %driven
by the flucutations of these higher correlation functions. Ordinary quantum
field theory corresponds to taking the lowest order functions, usually the mean
field and the 2-point functions. As such, our reasoning shows that it is an
effective theory which can be intrinsically dissipative. The relation of loop
expansion and correlation order as well as the introduction of an arrow of time
from the choice of boundary conditions are expounded with regard to the origin
of dissipation in quantum fields. Relation with critical phenomena, quantum

width or variance). We discuss how with a modest downward adjustment of the

definition of a two-state Hilbert space and basic operations, we systematically
recast the basics of quantum mechanics - dynamics, observables, and measurement
theory - in terms of two-states as the elementary quantities. We find a simple
and suggestive formulation, that ``unifies'' two complementary observables:
probabilistic observables and non-probabilistic `weak' observables.
Probabilities are relevant for measurements in the `strong coupling regime'.
They are given by the absolute square of a two-amplitude (a projection of a
two-state). Non-probabilistic observables are observed in sufficiently `weak'
measurements, and are given by linear combinations of the two-amplitude. As a
sub-class they include the `weak values' of hermitian operators. We show that
in the intermediate regime, one may observe a mixing of probabilities and weak
values. A consequence of the suggested formalism and measurement theory, is
that the problem of non-locality and Lorentz non-covariance, of the usual
prescription with a `reduction', may be eliminated. We exemplify this point for
the EPR experiment and for a system under successive observations.
