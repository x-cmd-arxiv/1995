autocorrelation function of the mass distribution to the primordial spectrum of
density fluctuations for gravitational clustering in an $\Omega=1$ universe.
High resolution N-body simulations show this formula to work well for
scale-free spectra $P(k) \propto k^n$ when the spectral index $n\sim 0$, but
not when $n \lsim -1$. We show that a modified version of the formula can work
well provided its form depends on $n$. This dependence can be derived from a
simple physical model for collapse from Gaussian initial conditions. Our
modified formula is easy to apply and is an excellent fit to N-body simulations
with $0 \leq n \leq -2$. It can also be applied to non-power law initial
spectra such as that of the standard Cold Dark Matter model by using the local
spectral index at the current nonlinear scale as the effective value of $n$ at
any given redshift. We give analytic expressions both for the nonlinear
correlation function and for the nonlinear power spectrum.

  blank page between text and figures on page 39",,"10.1007/BF02179989",,"comp-gas nlin.CG",,"  We study numerically the nature of the diffusion process on a honeycomb and a
quasi-lattice, where a point particle, moving along the bonds of the lattice,
scatters from randomly placed scatterers on the lattice sites according to
strictly deterministic rules. For the honeycomb lattice fully occupied by fixed
rotators two (symmetric) isolated critical points appear to be present, with
the same hyperscaling relation as for the square and the triangular lattices.
No such points appear to exist for the quasi-lattice. A comprehensive
comparison is made with the behavior on the previously studied square and
triangular lattices. A great variety of diffusive behavior is found ranging
from propagation, super-diffusion, normal, quasi-normal, anomalous to absence
of diffusion. The influence of the scattering rules as well as of the lattice
structure on the diffusive behavior of a point particle moving on the all
lattices studied so far, is summarized.

skyrmion approach that yields appreciable spin content for the proton.
Unfortunately there is no accessible experiment that can fix the coefficient of
this term directly; plausible but highly uncertain values for it gave a result
for the spin content loosely consistent with the currently measured
$\Delta\Sigma = 0.27\pm 0.13.$ We here attempt to narrow the range of values
for this coefficient by performing global fits to all the parameters of the
generalized Skyrme lagrangian while requiring reasonable results for the baryon
octet and decuplet masses and octet magnetic moments. This requirement fixes
the coefficient loosely, and we find that parameter sets that fit the baryon
masses and magnetic moments yield proton spin content near $\Delta\Sigma \sim
0.15.$

is exactly the existence of a Sigma_1-reflecting cardinal (which is less than
the existence of a Mahlo cardinal).
