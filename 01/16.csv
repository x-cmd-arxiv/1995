  Theorem. Let $S$ be a smooth surface of degree $d$ in $\pfour$ not of general
type. Then either $d \leq 70$ or $S$ lies on a hypersurface in $\pfour$ of

  Theory",,,,,"astro-ph",,"  The following principle of minimum energy may be a powerful substitute to the
dynamical perturbation method, when the latter is hard to apply. Fluid elements
of self-gravitating barotropic flows, whose vortex lines extend to the boundary
of the fluid, are labelled in such a way that any change of trial
configurations automatically preserves mass and circulation. The velocity field
is given by a mass conserving Clebsch representation. With three independent
Lagrangian functions, the total energy is stationary for all small variations
about a flow with fixed linear and angular momenta provided Euler's equations
for steady motion are satisfied. Thus, steady flows are stable if their energy
is minimum. Since energy is here minimized subject to having local and global
contants of the motion fixed, stability limits obtained that way are expected
to be close to limits given by dynamical perturbation methods. Moreover, the
stability limits are with respect to arbitrary, not necessary small,
perturbations. A weaker form of the energy principle is also given which may be
easier to apply. The Lagrangian functional, with the same three Lagrange
variables is stationary for the fully time dependent Euler equations. It
follows that the principle of minimum energy gives stability conditions that
are both necessary and sufficient if terms linear in time derivatives
(gyroscopic terms) are absent from the Lagrangian. The gyroscopic term for
small deviations around steady flows is given explicitly. Key words: Energy
variational principle; Self-gravitating systems; Stability of fluids.

an argument is given that the spectral weight vanishes at the Nagaoka energy
faster than any power law, as supported also by a clear numerical evidence. It

of the high momentum $\gamma^*$ may produce a point like configuration, which
evolves with time. In this case, the final state interactions probe the point
like configuration at the early stage of its evolution. The result is that
significant color transparency effects, which can either enhance or suppress
computed cross sections, are predicted to occur for $\sim 4 GeV^2 \ge
Q^2\leq~10~(GeV/c)^2$.

$\pi$-production threshold to search for kinematics that best differentiate
model-dependent descriptions of the NN $t$-matrix and accentuate the
contributions of isoscalar meson-exchange currents. Existing optimization
procedures are shown to be completely unreliable due to the neglect of
meson-exchange currents and phase space variations. We show that phase-space
hides the most important differences in model $t$-matrices, but that improved
data will be critical to further investigations of exchange currents.

bracket compatible with the multiplication is related to a differentiation in
tensor square of the underlying algebra. Jacobi identity means that this
differentiation satisfies a classical Yang--Baxter equation. Corresponding Lie
groups are canonically equipped with a Poisson Lie structure. A way to quantize
such structures is suggested.

operators. The quantum superalgebra $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$, defined as usual in terms
of its Chevalley generators, is shown to be isomorphic to an associative
algebra generated by so-called pre-oscillator operators satisfying a number of
relations. From these relations, and the analogue with the non-deformed case,
one can interpret these pre-oscillator operators as deformed para-Bose
operators. Some consequences for $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$ (Cartan-Weyl basis,
Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt basis) and its Hopf subalgebra $U_q[gl(n)]$ are
pointed out. Finally, using a realization in terms of ``$q$-commuting''
$q$-bosons, we construct an irreducible finite-dimensional unitary Fock
representation of $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$ and its decomposition in terms of
$U_q[gl(n)]$ representations when $q$ is a root of unity.

single-photon wavepackets to be transmitted through a multilayer dielectric
mirror, which functions as a ``photonic bandgap'' medium. By varying the angle
of incidence, we are able to confirm the behavior predicted by the group delay
(stationary phase approximation), including a variation of the delay time from
superluminal to subluminal as the band edge is tuned towards to the wavelength
of our photons. The agreement with theory is better than 0.5 femtoseconds (less
than one quarter of an optical period) except at large angles of incidence. The
source of the remaining discrepancy is not yet fully understood.
