two components: an electron-electron interaction containing the nonequilibrium

polarization of the electrons. Each of these two interactions is screened by
only the electronic part of the total dielectric function which contains the

electron-hole pairs in steady state is used to eliminate the nonequilibrium

system of electrons and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons in n-type GaAs. The
Boltzmann equation is solved exactly for low electric fields by an iterative
method, including electron-electron and electron-LO phonon scattering
dynamically screened in the random-phase-approximation (RPA). The LO phonon
self-energy is treated in the plasmon-pole approximation. Scattering from
ionized impurities screened in static RPA is calculated with phase-shift cross
sections, and scattering from RPA screened deformation potential and
piezoelectric acoustic phonons is included in the elastic approximation. The
results show that dynamic screening and plasmon-phonon coupling significantly
modify inelastic scattering at low temperatures and densities. The effect on
mobility is obscured by ionized impurity scattering in conventionally doped
material, but should be important in modulation doped structures. For
uncompensated bulk n-type GaAs, the RPA phase-shift model for electron-impurity
scattering gives lower drift mobilities than the standard Thomas-Fermi or Born
calculations which are high compared to experiment. Electron-electron
scattering lowers the mobility further, giving improved agreement with
experiment though discrepancies persist at high donor concentrations
($n>10^{18}{\rm cm}^{-3}$). When impurities are ignored, inelastic scattering
from the coupled electron-phonon system is the strongest scattering mechanism
at 77 K for moderate doping. This result differs from the standard model
neglecting mode coupling and electron-electron scattering which has the
acoustic modes dominant in this regime.

of supersymmetric grand unified theories. It can be argued that the most
natural reason for the Higgs doublets to be light is that they are
pseudo-Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breakdown of an
accidental global symmetry. In this paper we discuss the possibility of
implementing this idea in the SU(6) model of refs. \cite{Zur,Bar2,Bar3,Bar4}.
We show that although it is simple to generate an accidental symmetry of the
renormalizable terms of the potential, it is quite difficult to construct a
model which allows for the preservation of the accidental symmetry in the
nonrenormalizable terms. We summarize the constraints on such models and then
give three different ways to construct a superpotential where the dangerous
mixing terms are sufficiently suppressed even in the presence of
nonrenormalizable operators. With these examples we demonstrate the existence
of consistent models implementing the Higgs as pseudo-Goldstone boson scheme.
We extend one of the three examples to include fermion masses. We also show
that when restricted to regular group embeddings the only possible models
without light triplets are trivial generalizations of the SU(6) model we
consider.

of the missing momentum distribution are large over the whole range of missing

longitudinal and transverse missing momentum distributions. It is shown that
allowance for finite longitudinal size of the interaction region for

momentum $p_m \gsim 0.9 fm^{-1}$. At larger $p_m \gsim 1.5 fm^{-1}$, FSI
completely dominates both missing momentum distribution and tensor analyzing
power. We find that to a large extent FSI masks the sensitivity of the tensor
analyzing power to models of the deuteron wave function. For the transversely
polarized deuterons the FSI induced forward-backward asymmetry of the missing
momentum distribution is shown to have a node at precisely the same value of
$p_m$ as the PWIA missing momentum distribution. The position of this node is
not affected by FSI and can be a tool to distinguish experimentally between
different models for the deuteron wave function.
