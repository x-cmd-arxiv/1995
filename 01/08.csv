strongly correlated electronic systems we bring in as its representative the
nearest-neighbor repulsion ($v$) in addition to the on-site repulsion ($u$) and
shall investigate the possibility of the superconducting transition of carriers
doped into the charge-density wave (CDW) state expected for $v\,>\,u/4$ in
2-dimensional square lattice. We shall see that strongly correlated hopping
processes of doped carriers make the systems superconducting. The favored
superconducting phase is of extended s-wave symmetry, and $T_{c} \sim$100K is
shown to easily be attained near the half-filling.

model. These effects are found to be finite and even negligible for typical
parameters.

functions which include order by order convergent sums of all leading
logarithms of $x$. This gives a leading twist evolution equation for parton
distributions which sums all leading logarithms of $x$ and $Q^2$, allowing
stable perturbative evolution down to arbitrarily small values of $x$.
Perturbative evolution then generates the double scaling rise of $F_2$ observed
at HERA, while in the formal limit $x\to 0$ at fixed $Q^2$ the Lipatov
$x^{-\lambda}$ behaviour is eventually reproduced. We are thus able to explain
why leading order perturbation theory works so well in the HERA region.

obtain a crossover in the amplitude for the correlation function for the Ising
model which doesn't change the critical exponent, and a shift in the critical
exponent produced by randomness in the case of the Potts model. A comparison
with numerical data is discussed briefly.

performed in the framework of the relativistic mean field (RMF) theory using
the recently proposed relativistic parameter set NL-SH. It is shown that the
RMF theory provides an unified and excellent description of the binding
energies, isotope shifts and deformation properties of nuclei over a large
range of isospin in the Z=40 region. It is observed that the RMF theory with
the force NL-SH is able to describe the anomalous kinks in isotope shifts in Kr
and Sr nuclei, the problem which has hitherto remained unresolved. This is in
contrast with the density-dependent Skyrme Hartree-Fock approach which does not
reproduce the behaviour of the isotope shifts about shell closure. On the Zr
chain we predict that the isotope shifts exhibit a trend similar to that of the
Kr and Sr nuclei. The RMF theory also predicts shape coexistence in heavy Sr
isotopes. Several dramatic shape transitions in the isotopic chains are shown
to be a general feature of nuclei in this region. A comparison of the
properties with the available mass models shows that the results of the RMF
theory are generally in accord with the predictions of the finite-range droplet
model.
