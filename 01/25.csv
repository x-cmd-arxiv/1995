combination of bremsstrahlung, intrinsic line emission, and reflection of the
nuclear continuum, both by electron scattering and by resonance line
scattering. Resonance lines, due both to intrinsic emission and scattering, are
particularly prominent in the soft X-ray band.
  When our line of sight to the nucleus is not obscured, the dominant effect is
absorption. In the soft X-ray band, ionization edges of highly ionized species
and resonance lines contribute comparably to the opacity; in the ultraviolet,
the gas is almost transparent except for a small number of resonance lines. We
identify the ""warm absorbers"" seen in many AGN X-ray spectra with this gas, but
argue that most of the UV absorption lines seen must be due to a small amount
of more weakly ionized gas which is embedded in the main body of the warm,
reflecting gas. Because the ionization equilibration timescales of some ions
may be as long as the variability timescales in AGN, the ionic abundances
indicated by the transmission spectra may not be well-described by ionization
equilibrium.

using numerical simulation. As the orbit of a satellite decays through
dynamical friction, the primary disk develops large-amplitude spirals in
response to its tidal forcing. While these features arise in both the stars and
the gas in the disk, the non--axisymmetric structures in the gas differ
slightly from those in the stars. In particular, as a consequence of the
formation of strong shocks in the gas and the effects of radiative cooling, the
gas response tends to lead the stellar response, enabling the stars to strongly
torque the gas. These torques deprive the gas of its angular momentum, forcing
a significant fraction of it into the inner regions of the disk. The radial
inflows induced by these mergers accumulate large quantities of interstellar
gas in the nuclear regions of the host disks. In some cases, nearly half of all
the gas initially distributed throughout the disk winds up in a dense ``cloud''
several hundred parsecs in extent. The models reported here do not include star
formation and, so, we cannot determine the ultimate fate of the gas.
Nevertheless, given the high densities in the nuclear gas, it is plausible to
identify these concentrations of dense gas in the remnants with those
accompanying intense starbursts in some active galaxies. Therefore, the
calculations here provide a framework for interpreting the origin of nuclear
activity in otherwise quiescent disk galaxies. To the extent that galaxy
formation is a chaotic process in which large structures are built up by the
accretion of smaller fragments, our models may also be relevant to starbursts
and the onset of nuclear activity in proto--galaxies at high redshifts.

equilibrium temperatures within a factor of a few of 100 keV. We also determine
quantitatively the (wide) bounds on heating rate and seed photon supply for

  Plasmas in thermal balance in this regime obey two simple scaling laws, one
relating the product of temperature and optical depth to the ratio of seed
photon luminosity to plasma heating rate $l_s/l_h$, the other relating the
spectral index of the output power-law to $l_s/l_h$. Because $\alpha$ is almost
independent of everything but $l_s/l_h$, the observed power law index may be

separation is addressed in the framework of Hartree-Fock theory. We find a
strong tendency towards Nagaoka ferromagnetism on the non-bipartite lattices
(triangular, kagome) for more than half filling. For the triangular lattice we
find the Nagaoka state to be unstable above a critical density of $n=1.887$ at
$U=\infty$, thereby significantly improving former variational results. For the
kagome lattice the region where ferromagnetism prevails in the phase diagram
widely exceeds the flat band regime. Our results even allow the stability of

representations of the Virasoro algebra with central charge $c = 1/2$. The
Neveu-Schwarz (NS) sector is the direct sum of an $h = 0$ and an $h = 1/2$
module, and the Ramond (R) sector is the direct sum of two copies of an $h =
1/16$ module. In addition to the fundamental fermions, which represent a
Clifford algebra, and the Virasoro operators, there are infinitely many other
vertex operators, in one-to-one correspondence with the vectors (states) in the
NS sector. These give the NS sector the structure of a Vertex Operator
SuperAlgebra, and the R sector the structure of a ${\bold Z}_2$-twisted module
for that VOSA. Keeping both copies of the $h = 1/16$ modules in the R sector,
we can define intertwining operators in one-to-one correspondence with the
states in the R sector such that the usual Ising fusion rules for just three
modules are replaced by a rule given by the group ${\bold Z}_4$. The main
objective is to find a generalization of the VOSA Jacobi-Cauchy identity which
is satisfied by these intertwining operators. There are several novel features
of this new ``Matrix'' Jacobi-Cauchy Identity (MJCI), most of which come from
the fact that correlation functions made from two intertwiners are
hypergeometric functions. In order to relate and rationalize the correlation
functions we use the Kummer quadratic transformation formulas, lifting the
functions to a four-sheeted covering, branched over the usual three poles,
where the Cauchy residue theorem can be applied. The six possible poles on the
cover give six terms in the MJCI. Furthermore, we organize those functions into
$2\times 4$ matrices and find the $2\times 2$ (fusion and braiding) matrices
which relate them at the six poles. These results for intertwiners

method exploits the real-space localization of the density matrix, and in this

matrix is expressed in terms of localized support functions, and a matrix of
variational parameters, L, having a finite spatial range. The total energy is
minimized with respect to both the support functions and the elements of the L
matrix. The method is variational, and becomes exact as the ranges of the
support functions and the L matrix are increased. We have tested the method on
crystalline silicon systems containing up to 216 atoms, and we discuss some of
these results.

to subtract suitable local and polynomial counterterms in the external and

explicitly in a vector gauge invariant regularization, and obtain modifications
to the total effective action and vector and axial currents. We study the
numerical influence of those counterterms in the two flavour version of model
with dynamical $\sigma,\pi, \rho, A $ and $\omega$ mesons. We find that, for
time independent hedgehog configurations, the numerical effects in the nucleon
