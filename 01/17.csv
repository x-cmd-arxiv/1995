diffusion, and convective overshoot on the p-mode oscillation spectrum and the
neutrino flux of the standard solar model. To isolate the various physical
affects included in the new rotation plus diffusion models we also constructed
solar models to test the significance of diffusion and of overshoot by
themselves. In previous studies, models that include helium diffusion during
solar evolution were found to improve the predicted p-mode frequencies for some
modes and worsen the agreement for others (Guenther \ea 1993). Here we verify
this result for both the Bahcall and Loeb (1990) formulation of diffusion and
the Proffitt and Michaud (1991) formulation of diffusion. We find that the
effects of rotation on the Sun's structure in the outer layers perturbs the
$p$-mode frequencies only slightly when compared to the more substantial
effects due to diffusion. In the thin overshoot layer (taken here to be $0.1\,
H_p$), we have compared the effect of overmixing in a radiative layer versus
convective (adiabatic) penetration. Neither radiative overmixing nor adiabatic
penetration has any significant effect on the $p$-modes, probably in part
because the overshoot layer is constrained to be thin. The predicted neutrino
flux in our diffusion plus rotation model is 7.12 SNU for Cl detectors, 127 SNU
for Ga detectors and $5.00\times 10^6\,{\rm erg \, cm^{-2} }$ for the $^8$B
neutrinos; this is approximately half-way between the standard solar model
without diffusion, and the standard solar model with diffusion alone.

All the correlation functions of the system may be obtained with the use of a
generating functional. Short-range and Coulomb interactions do not destroy the
Landau Fermi fixed point. Novel fixed points are found, however, in the cases
of a super-long range longitudinal interaction in two dimensions and transverse
gauge interactions in two and three spatial dimensions. We consider in some
detail the 2+1-dimensional problem of a Chern-Simons gauge action combined with
a longitudinal two-body interaction $V({\bf q}) \propto |{\bf q}|^{y-1}$ which
controls the density, and hence gauge, fluctuations. For $y < 0$ we find that
the gauge interaction is irrelevant and the Landau fixed point is stable, while
for $y > 0$ the interaction is relevant and the fixed point cannot be accessed
by bosonization. Of special importance is the case $y = 0$ (Coulomb
interaction) which describes the Halperin-Lee-Read theory of the half-filled
Landau level. We obtain the full quasiparticle propagator which is of a
marginal Fermi liquid form. Using Ward Identities, we show that neither the
inclusion of nonlinear terms in the fermion dispersion, nor vertex corrections,
alters our results: the fixed point is accessible by bosonization. As the
two-point fermion Green's function is not gauge invariant, we also investigate
the gauge-invariant density response function. Near momentum $Q = 2 k_F$, in
addition to the Kohn anomaly we find singular behavior. In Appendices we

found that the signal for the occurrence of the SG transition will manifest
itself in free-energy {\sl fluctuations\/} only, and not in the free energy
itself. Eigenvalues of the inverse SG susceptibility matrix is then approached
by the Rayleigh Ritz method which provides an upper bound. Coming from the
paramagnetic phase {\sl on the Curie line,\/} one is able to use a virial-like
relationship generated by scaling the {\sl single\/} unit length $ (D<6; $ in
higher dimension a new length sets in, the inverse momentum cut off).
Instability towards a SG phase being probed on pairs of {\sl distinct\/}

magnetic fluid phase, we perform Gibbs ensemble simulations to determine phase
coexistence curves at large dipole moments, $\mu$. The critical temperature is
found to depend linearly on $\mu^2$ for intermediate values of $\mu$ beyond the
initial nonlinear behavior near $\mu=0$ and less than the $\mu$ where no

applied field, the critical temperatures as a function of the applied field for

hardly change as a function of applied field. We also verify that in an applied
