oscillators with randomly distributed frequencies is studied for phase
dynamical models with arbitrary coupling. The population is described by a
Fokker-Planck equation for the distribution of phases which includes the
diffusive effect of noise in the oscillator frequencies. The bifurcation from
the phase-incoherent state is analyzed using amplitude equations for the
unstable modes with particular attention to the dependence of the nonlinearly
saturated mode $|\alpha_\infty|$ on the linear growth rate $\gamma$. In general
we find $|\alpha_\infty|\sim \sqrt{\gamma(\gamma+l^2D)}$ where $D$ is the
diffusion coefficient and $l$ is the mode number of the unstable mode. The
unusual $(\gamma+l^2D)$ factor arises from a singularity in the cubic term of
the amplitude equation.

years. A recent theoretical proposal gives quantitative predictions, which can
be tested with data. Specifically, it has been suggested, that all cosmic rays
can be attributed to just three source sites: i) supernova explosions into the
interstellar medium, ii) supernova explosions into a stellar wind, and iii)
powerful radiogalaxies. The cosmic rays from any extragalactic source suffer
from interaction with the microwave background, leading to the
Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff. While the particle energies, the spectrum and
the chemical composition of cosmic rays over the energy range from about GeV to
about 100 EeV can be interpreted in the theory, there are exciting measurements
now: New measurements show that there are cosmic ray events beyond the
Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff. We discuss here possible sources, and
specifically ask whether powerful radiogalaxies are suitable candidates. The
basic concepts used here are the minimal hypothesis that the intergalactic
magnetic field is given by the galaxy distribution, and the observation that
radio galaxies also cluster like galaxies.

that seeds for quasar black holes could have originated from the initial

of these seeds have a mass of order 10^6 solar masses, just above the
cosmological Jeans mass. For Cold Dark Matter cosmologies, we find of order one
seed black hole per bright galaxy. After the galaxy forms, the seeds inside its
bulge sink to the center by dynamical friction. We also describe a few
empirical methods to study the properties of quasars and their environments.
These include: probing quasar hosts through [C II] emission, finding quasar
lifetimes from the ``proximity effect'' along two lines of sight, and measuring
the amplitude of clustering at high redshifts through the detection of
Lyman-alpha clouds beyond the quasar redshift.

curvature, we show that space--time uncertainty derived by Ng and van Dam
implies absurd uncertainties of the Riemannian curvature.

arises not because of the fallacy of the time-symmetric approach as he claimed,
but due to an inappropriate usage of retrodiction.

quantum field theory. To illustrate the role of gauge invariance, we first
discuss the charge superselection rule in quantum electrodynamics in some
detail. We then present an example where macroscopic electromagnetic fields are
``measured"" through interaction with charges and thereby rendered classical.
