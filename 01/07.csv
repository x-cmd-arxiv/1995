collections of particles that should be nearly ideal for parallel
architectures. Our method is derived from the ``self-consistent field'' (SCF)
approach suggested previously by Clutton-Brock and others. Owing to the use of
a global description of the gravitational field, the particles in an SCF
simulation do not interact with one another directly, minimizing communications
overhead between nodes in a parallel implementation. Ideal load-balancing is
achieved since precisely the same number of operations are needed to compute
the acceleration for each particle. Consequently, the SCF technique is
perfectly scalable and the size of feasible applications will grow in simple
proportion to advances in computational hardware. We describe an SCF code
developed for and tested on a Connection Machine 5. Empirical tests demonstrate
the efficient and scalable nature of the algorithm. Depending on the
application, simulations with particle numbers in the range $N\sim 10^7 -
10^{8.5}$ are now possible. Larger platforms should make simulations with
billions of particles feasible in the near future. Specific astrophysical
applications are discussed in the context of collisionless dynamics.

$M_V = -16.5$ lie within a projected distance of 25 kpc of the quasars; three
of the companions are located closer than $3''$ (6 kpc projected distance) from
the quasars, well within the volume that would be enclosed by a typical $L^*$
host galaxy. The observed association of quasars and companion galaxies is
statistically significant and may be an important element in the
luminous-quasar phenomenon. Evidence for candidate host galaxies is presented
for the three most promising cases: PG 1116+215, 3C 273, and PG 1444+407, but
additional observations are required before the characteristics of the
candidate hosts can be regarded as established. Upper limits are placed on the
visual-band brightnesses of representative galactic hosts for all of the
quasars. These limits are established by placing galaxy images obtained with
HST underneath the quasars and measuring at what faintness level the known
galaxies are detected. On average, the HST spirals would have been detected if
they were one magnitude fainter than $L^*$ or brighter and the early-type
galaxies could have been detected down to a brightness level of about $L^*$,
where $L^*$ is the Schechter characteristic luminosity of field galaxies.
