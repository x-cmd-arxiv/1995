Accepted for ApJ.",,"10.1086/175880","MPK-ASTRO-95-01","astro-ph",,"  The observations of radio emission from SNR~1987A can be accounted for on the
basis of diffusive shock acceleration of electrons by the supernova blast wave.
However, with this interpretation the observed spectral index implies that the
compression ratio of the gas subshock is roughly $2.7$ rather than the value of
$4$ expected of a strong shock front. We propose that in SNR~1987A, ions also
undergo diffusive acceleration at the shock, a process that is likely to be
rapid. Unlike the electron population, the accelerated ions can have an
important effect on the gas dynamics. We calculate this coupled gas and
energetic particle dynamics on the basis of the two-fluid model, in which the
accelerated ions provide an additional component to the total pressure acting
on the fluid. By accelerating and possibly heating the upstream plasma, the
initially strong shock is modified and a weaker subshock with an upstream
precursor results. The electrons behave as test particles. They are accelerated
at the evolving subshock, escape downstream, and emit synchrotron radiation in
the swept up magnetic field. Two models are considered for the surroundings of
the progenitor: that of a freely expanding wind of number density $n\propto
r^{-2}$, and that of a wind confined by a shell of denser material, creating a
stagnation zone of roughly constant density beyond the standing shock which
terminates the free wind. We model the observed radio light curves and the
relatively steep spectrum of SNR~1987A using similar values for the ion
acceleration parameters to those used in models of cosmic ray acceleration in
older SNRs which can also contain high Mach number shocks, and find a good fit
for the case in which the termination shock is located at about $2\times
10^{15}\,$m from the progenitor.

method we can convincingly rule out a time delay near 536 days and show that
the time delay is in the vicinity of 420 days. We then introduce refinements to
our method in order to get a stable and reliable result for the time delay
independent of high frequency noise in the data and sampling errors. Our best
result for the time delay, checked by various statistical tests and using
bootstrap error estimates, is 423 +/- 6 days. We furthermore confirm our
earlier result that the radio data are compatible with this value. Using the
best available model for the mass distribution in the lensing galaxy and

smaller than 70 km/(s Mpc).

next-to-leading order contributions not shift the location
z=(m_t^{bare}/Lambda)^2 of the minimum drastically, e.g.~by not more than a
factor of 2. The results are reproduced diagrammatically, where the leading

  Strasbourg""",,,"LPTENS-95/1","hep-th",,"  In the present contribution, I report on certain {\it non-linear} and {\it
non-local} extensions of the conformal (Virasoro) algebra. These so-called
$V$-algebras are matrix generalizations of $W$-algebras. First, in the context
of two-dimensional field theory, I discuss the non-abelian Toda model which
possesses three conserved (chiral) ``currents"". The Poisson brackets of these
``currents"" give the simplest example of a $V$-algebra. The classical solutions
of this model provide a free-field realization of the $V$-algebra. Then I show
that this $V$-algebra is identical to the second Gelfand-Dikii symplectic
structure on the manifold of $2\times 2$-matrix Schr\""odinger operators
$L=-\d^2+U$ (with $\tr\sigma_3 U=0$). This provides a relation with matrix
KdV-hierarchies and allows me to obtain an infinite family of conserved charges
(Hamiltonians in involution). Finally, I work out the general
$V_{n,m}$-algebras as symplectic structures based on $n\times n$-matrix $m^{\rm
th}$-order differential operators $L=-\d^m +U_2\d^{m-2}+U_3 \d^{m-3}+\ldots
+U_m$. It is the absence of $U_1$, together with the non-commutativity of
matrices that leads to the non-local terms in the $V_{n,m}$-algebras. I show
that the conformal properties are similar to those of $W_m$-algebras, while the
complete $V_{n,m}$-algebras are much more complicated, as is shown on the
explicit example of $V_{n,3}$.

The corrections are sizeable because they involve the isoscalar s-wave $\pi N$

larger than the on-shell one. In addition, the s-wave optical potential is
reanalyzed by looking at all the different conventional contributions together
lowest order, Pauli corrected rescattering term, second order absorptive
effects, terms from the interaction of pions with the virtual pion cloud
(chiral corrections) and correlation effects. Different off-shell
extrapolations for the $\pi N$ amplitude are used and it is found that,
although some individual terms are sensitive to the extrapolation, the sum of
them is rather insensitive. The results are compared with empirical values from
best fits to the data and are found to be compatible, within theoretical and
empirical uncertainties. The results do not rule out further contributions but
they put stringent constraints on their strength.
