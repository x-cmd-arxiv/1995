instr- ument on board the ROSAT X-ray satellite. Ten individual sources are
found. Three sources (X-1, X-2 and X-3 [SN~1978K]) are very bright (~10^40
erg/s) and are unusual in that analogous objects do not exist in our Galaxy. We
present an X-ray image of NGC~1313 and \xray spectra for the three bright
sources. The emission from the nuclear region (R ~< 2 kpc) is dominated by
source X-1, which is located ~1 kpc north of the photometric (and dynamical)
center of NGC~1313. Optical, far-infrared and radio images do not indicate the
presence of an active galactic nucleus at that position; however, the compact
nature of the \xray source (X-1) suggests that it is an accretion-powered
object with central mass M >~ 10^3 Msun. Additional emission (L_X ~ 10^39
erg/s) in the nuclear region extends out to ~2.6 kpc and roughly follows the
spiral arms. This emission is from 4 sources with luminosity of several x 10^38
erg/s, two of which are consistent with emission from population I sources
(e.g., supernova remnants, and hot interstellar gas which has been heated by
supernova remnants). The other two sources could be emission from population II
sources (e.g., low-mass \xray binaries). The bright sources X-2 and SN~1978K
are positioned in the southern disk of NGC~1313. X-2 is variable and has no
optical counterpart brighter than 20.8 mag (V-band). It is likely that it is an
accretion-powered object in NGC~1313. The type-II supernova SN~1978K (Ryder
\etal 1993) has become extra- ordinarily luminous in X-rays $\sim$13 years
after optical maximum.

observational systematic uncertainties is the key feature limiting our ability
to constrain theory with observation. Nevertheless, several very important
constraints are currently obtainable. For example, assuming maximal systematic
uncertainties in $^4$He, D, and $^7$Li we find a conservative upper limit of
$\Omega_B \le 0.16$ in order for BBN predictions to agree with observations.
Equally significant, we find that BBN predictions are inconsistent unless
$^4He$ abundance by mass is greater than $23.9\%$, or D +$^3$He estimates are
incorrect. By contrast, unless systematic uncertainties are taken into account,
the quoted $2\sigma$ observational upper limit on the primordial $^4He$

extension of the zeroth law of thermodynamics to non equilibrium states and it
leads to the identification of a unique distribution $\m$ describing the
asymptotic properties of the time evolution of the system for initial data
randomly chosen with respect to a uniform distribution on phase space. For
conservative systems in thermal equilibrium the chaotic hypothesis implies the
ergodic hypothesis. We outline a procedure to obtain the distribution $\m$: it
leads to a new unifying point of view for the phase space behavior of
dissipative and conservative systems. The chaotic hypothesis is confirmed in a
non trivial, parameter--free, way by a recent computer experiment on the
entropy production fluctuations in a shearing fluid far from equilibrium.
Similar applications to other models are proposed, in particular to a model for
the Kolmogorov--Obuchov theory for turbulent flow.

quantum fields in a large class of spacetimes. Nevertheless, it is easy to show
by using a simple scaling argument that ANEC as stated cannot hold generically
in curved four-dimensional spacetime, and this scaling argument has been widely
interpreted as a death-blow for averaged energy conditions in quantum field
theory. In this note I propose a simple generalization of ANEC, in which the
right-hand-side of the ANEC inequality is replaced by a finite (but in general
negative) state-independent lower bound. As long as attention is focused on
asymptotically well-behaved spacetimes, this generalized version of ANEC is
safe from the threat of the scaling argument, and thus stands a chance of being
generally valid in four-dimensional curved spacetime. I argue that when
generalized ANEC holds, it has implications for the non-negativity of total
energy and for singularity theorems similar to the implications of ANEC. In
particular, I show that if generalized ANEC is satisfied in static traversable
wormhole spacetimes (which is likely but remains to be shown), then macroscopic
wormholes (but not necessarily microscopic, Planck-size wormholes) are ruled
out by quantum field theory.

measurement process is proposed by considering the interaction of a quantum
system (spin-1/2) with a macroscopic quantum apparatus interacting with an
environment in a dissipative manner. The dissipative interaction leads to
decoherence in the superposition states of the apparatus, making its behaviour
classical in the sense that the density matrix becomes diagonal with time.
Since the apparatus is also interacting with the system, the probabilities of
the diagonal density matrix are determined by the state vector of the system.
We consider a Stern-Gerlach type model, where a spin- 1/2 particle is in an
inhomogeneous magnetic field, the whole set up being in contact with a large
environment. Here we find that the density matrix of the combined system and
apparatus becomes diagonal and the momentum of the particle becomes correlated
with a spin operator, selected by the choice of the system-apparatus
interaction. This allows for a measurement of spin via a momentum measurement
on the particle with associated probabilities in accordance with quantum
principles.
