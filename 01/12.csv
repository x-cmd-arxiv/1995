vortices, the effects of self-gravity, magnetic fields, and nonlinear aspects
of the problem. We find that these vortices can exist in many different forms
in the disks of young stellar objects and may play a role in the formation of
binary companions and/or giant planets. Vortices may enhance giant planet
formation via gravitational instability by allowing dust grains (heavy
elements) to settle to the center on a short timescale; the gravitational
instability itself is also enhanced because the vortices also create a larger
local surface density in the disk. In addition, vortices can enhance energy
dissipation in disks and thereby affect disk accretion. Finally, we consider
the possibility that vortices of this type exist in molecular clouds and in the
disk of the galaxy itself. On all of these size scales, vortices can produce
long-lived structures which may correspond to observed structures in these
systems.

Hamiltonians is studied through the analysis of its representation in the basis
of energy eigenstates. It is shown that this representation becomes similar to
that of the standard Heisenberg algebra, and it is dependent of a parameter
$w\geq 0$. We name it {\it distorted Heisenberg algebra}, where $w$ is the
distortion parameter. The corresponding coherent states for an arbitrary $w$
are derived, and some particular examples are discussed in full detail. A
prescription to produce the squeezing, by adequately selecting the initial
state of the system, is given.

The physical picture emerging from this study is that the $\bar t$ (background)

Field. This model is formally soluble in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ though
explicit solutions are available for a very limited number of scalar
potentials. A ``Double Penner'' Model in which the potential has two
logarithmic singularities provides an example of a explicitly soluble model. We
begin by reviewing the formal solution to this Double Penner KM Model. We pay
special attention to the relationship of this model to an ordinary (one) matrix
model whose potential has two logarithmic singularities (the Double Penner
Model). We present a detailed analysis of the large N behavior of this Double
Penner Model. We describe the various one cut and two cut solutions and we
discuss cases in which ``eigenvalue condensation'' occurs at the singular
points of the potential. We then describe the consequences of our study for the
KM Model described above. We present the phase diagram of the model and
describe its critical regions.

vacuum structure is found when the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken,
while the symmetric phase can have an infinite vacuum degeneracy at tree level.
The latter is due to the proliferation of neutral solitonic states that cost
zero energy. Various novel self-dual solitons, such as these, are found in both
the symmetric and the asymmetric phases. Also by considering a similar system
on a two-sphere and the subsequent large sphere limit, we isolate sensible and
finite expressions for the conserved angular and linear momenta, which satisfy
anomalous commutation relations. We conclude with a few remarks on unresolved
issues.

interesting property of the second Gelfand-Dickey brackets under multiplication
and inversion of Lax operators. As a byproduct we give an elegant and simple
proof of the generalised Kupershmidt-Wilson theorem.

$2k+1$. In the first nontrivial case $k=1$ we have the Painelev\'e-1 (P-1)
equation. Only special real ``separatrix'' solutions of P-1 are important in
the quantum field theory. By the conjecture of Novikov these ``physical''
solutions, which are analytically exceptional probably have much stronger
symmetry then the other solutions but it is not proved until now. Two
asymptotic methods were developed in the previous paper -- nonlinear
semiclassics (or the Bogolubov-Whitham averaging method) and the linear
semiclassics for the ``Isomonodromic'' method. The nonlinear semiclassics gives
a good approximation for the general (``non-physical'') solutions of P-1 but
fails in the ``physical'' case. In our paper the linear semiclasics for the
``physical'' solutions of the P-1 equations is studied. In particular
connection between the semiclassics on Riemann surfaces and Hamiltonian
foliations on these surfaces is established.
