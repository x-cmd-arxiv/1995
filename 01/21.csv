quantum-wells of two different thicknesses randomly distributed along the

allowing the quantum-well thicknesses to fluctuate around their {\em ideal}

the existence of a band of extended states in perfect correlated disordered
superlattices, giving rise to a strong enhancement of their finite-temperature
dc conductance as compared to usual random ones whenever the Fermi level
matches this band. This feature is seen to survive even if interface roughness
is taken into account. Our predictions can be used to demonstrate
experimentally that structural correlations inhibit the localization effects of
disorder, even in the presence of imperfections. This effect might be the basis
of new, filter-like or other specific-purpose electronic devices.
