radiation around 10 TeV/nucleon and above, we discuss the phenomenology of a
model in which there are two distinct kinds of cosmic ray accelerators in the
galaxy. Comparison of the spectra of hydrogen and helium up to 100 TeV per
nucleon suggests that these two elements do not have the same spectrum of
magnetic rigidity over this entire region and that these two dominant elements
therefore receive contributions from different sources.

the asymptotic dynamics of the system. We find a diverging diffusion constant
$D(t) \sim \log t$ and a phase transition for the generalized Lyapunov
exponents.

Berger \cite{Ber}. These connections occur on moduli spaces $\Y$ of rational
contact curves in a contact threefold $\W$. Therefore, they are naturally
contained in the moduli space $\Z$ of all rational curves in $\W$. We construct
a connection on $\Z$ whose restriction to $\Y$ is torsion free. However, the
connection on $\Z$ has torsion unless both $\Y$ and $\Z$ are flat. We also show
the existence of a new exotic holonomy which is a certain sixdimensional
representation of $\Sl \times \Sl$. We show that every regular $H_3$-connection
(cf. \cite{Br}) is the restriction of a unique connection with this holonomy.

wave-function. We confirm qualitatively the earlier theoretical ansatz on the
linear behaviour of the masses with the magnetic field and, as a by-product, we
improve the lattice measurements of the nucleon magnetic moments. However our
systematic and statistical errors preclude us from measuring the theoretically
predicted field strength at which the proton becomes heavier than the neutron.

momentum distribution of the bosons. For a boson system with a cylindrical
boundary, the momentum distribution is enhanced at high transverse momenta but
suppressed at low transverse momenta, relative to a Bose-Einstein distribution.
The boundary effects on systems of massless gluons and massive pions are
studied. For gluons in a quark-gluon plasma, the presence of the boundary may
modify the signals for the quark-gluon plasma. For pions in a pion system in
heavy-ion collisions, Coulomb final-state interactions with the nuclear
participants in the vicinity of the central rapidity region further modify the
momentum distribution at low transverse momenta. By including both the boundary
effect and the Coulomb final-state interactions we are able to account for the
behavior of the $\pi^{-}$ transverse momentum spectrum observed in many
heavy-ion experiments, notably at low transverse momenta.

the total screening of charges and the dynamical mass generation characteristic

anomaly results in the background linearly rising electric field or,
equivalently, in the exotic statistics of the physical matter field. We
construct the algebra of the Poincare generators and show that it differs from
the Poincare one. For the CSM on $R^1$, the anomaly influences only the mass
generation mechanism.

set can have a simpler definition if, for example, it is countable or if every
real is constructible.
  H. Friedman asked if the set of constructible reals can be analytic or even
Borel in a nontrivial way. A related problem was posed by K. Prikry: can there
exist a nonconstructible perfect set of constructible reals? The main result of
this paper is a negative answer to Friedman's question. In fact we prove that
if $M$ is an inner model of set theory and the set of reals in $M$ is analytic
then either all reals are in $M$ or else $\aleph _1^M$ is countable. We also
extend this result to higher levels of the projective hierarchy under
appropriate large cardinal assumptions.
  Concerning Prikry's problem we show that the answer is negative if ""perfect""
is replaced by ""superperfect"" but that it can be positive if ""constructible"" is
replaced by ""belonging to some inner model $M$"".
