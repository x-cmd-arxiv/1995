HI masses, the H$_2$ masses and the dust masses. We find that for far-infrared
selected galaxies: (1) the median value of M$_{H2}$/M$_{HI}$ is 0.5, meaning
that the atomic phase dominates in these galaxies. The fraction of gas in
molecular form increases with increasing FIR luminosity but does not show any
obvious trend with other galaxy properties. (2) the $H2$ surface density (s.d.)
is better correlated with the cold dust s.d. than the HI s.d., but the
correlation of HI with dust is not negligible. Globally in these galaxies the
cold dust emission is associated with both the molecular and atomic phases. (3)
the FIR surface brightness increases as the third power of the S60um/S100um
ratio, it shows a tight correlation with both the H$_2$ and dust surface
densities and a weaker one with the HI surface density: a large part of the
far-infrared emission of these galaxies originates in the molecular medium. (4)
the gas-to-dust ratio ranges between 100 and 1000 and its average value is 230,
close to the Galactic value. There is indeed a clear trend: this ratio
decreases as the FIR surface density increases, a result which can be explained
in the framework of an enhancement of metallicity in galaxy discs having a
higher star formation rate.

provided from large $N_C$ QCD. Rigorous results on the spontaneous breaking of

provides a fair description of low--energy hadron physics. The NJL model is
therefore employed to mimic the low--energy chiral flavor dynamics of QCD. The
model is bosonized by functional integral techniques and the physical content
of the emerging effective meson theory is discussed. In particular, its
relation to the Skyrme model is established. The static soliton solutions of
the bosonized NJL model are found, their properties discussed, and the
influence of various meson fields studied. These considerations provide strong
support of Witten's conjecture that baryons can be understood as soliton
solutions of effective meson theories. The chiral soliton of the NJL model is
then quantized in a semiclassical fashion and various static properties of the
nucleon are studied. The dominating $1/N_C$ corrections to the semiclassically
quantized soliton are investigated. Time--dependent meson fluctuations off the
chiral soliton are explored and employed to estimate the quantum corrections to
the soliton mass. Finally, hyperons are described as chiral solitons of the NJL
model. This is done in both, the collective rotational approach of Yabu and
Ando as well as in the bound state approach of Callan and Klebanov.

  Figures,",,,"MRI-PHY/94/17","hep-th",,"  Inspired by the usefulness of local scaling of time in the path integral
formalism, we introduce a new kind of hamiltonian path integral in this paper.
A special case of this new type of path integral has been earlier found useful
in formulating a scheme of hamiltonian path integral quantization in arbitrary
coordinates. This scheme has the unique feature that quantization in arbitrary
co-ordinates requires hamiltonian path integral to be set up in terms of the
classical hamiltonian only, without addition of any adhoc $ O(\hbar ^2) $terms.
In this paper we further study the properties of hamiltonian path integrals in
arbitrary co-ordinates with and without local scaling of time and obtain the
Schrodinger equation implied by the hamiltonian path integrals. As a simple
illustrative example of quantization in arbitrary coordinates and of exact path
integration we apply the results obtained to the case of Coulomb problem in two
dimensions.

hamiltonian without addition of adhoc $\hbar^2$ terms. In this paper we use
this hamiltonian formalism and show how exact path integration may be done for
several potentials.

renormalizable in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions and has a smooth $\epsilon\to 0$
limit.By performing a renormalization- group study of this last theory we show
that the gravitational coupling constant $G$ has a non-trivial,ultraviolet
stable fixed point (asymptotic freedom) and that the dilatonic coupling
functions (including the dilatonic potential) exhibit also a real, non-trivial
fixed point. At such point the theory represents a standard charged
string-inspired model.Stability and the gauge dependence of the fixed-point
solution is discussed.It is shown that all these properties remain valid in a
dilatonic-Yang-Mills theory with $n$ scalars and $m$ spinors, that has the UF
stable fixed point $G^* = 3\epsilon (48+12N-m-2n)^{-1}$.In addition, it is seen
that by increasing $N$ (number of gauge fields) the matter central charge
$C=n+m/2$ ($0<C<24+6N$) can be increased correspondingly (in pure dilatonic
gravity $0<C<24$).

of $\Delta$ resonance and pion production we focus on azimuthal correlations:
At projectile- and target-rapidities we observe an anticorrelation in the
in-plane transverse momentum between pions and protons. At c.m.-rapidity,
however, we find that high $p_t$ pions are being preferentially emitted
perpendicular to the event-plane. We investigate the causes of those
correlations and their sensitivity on the density and momentum dependence of
the real and imaginary part of the nucleon and pion optical potential.
