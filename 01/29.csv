that the local statistical properties of the quantum energy levels are well
described by Random Matrix Theory. We present here two counterexamples - the
hydrogen atom in a magnetic field and the quartic oscillator - which display
nearest neighbor statistics strongly different from the usual Wigner
distribution. We interpret the results with a simple model using a set of
regular states coupled to a set of chaotic states modeled by a random matrix.

tunneling. The approach is well suited to deal with the ``strong coupling''
situation near zero bias, where perturbation theory diverges. By a
semiclassical treatment, we reduce the physics to that of electrodynamics in
imaginary time, and express the anomaly through exact conductivity of the
system $\sigma(\omega, q)$ and exact interaction. For the diffusive anomaly, we
compare the result with the perturbation theory of Altshuler, Aronov, and Lee.
For the metal-insulator transition we derive exact relation of the anomaly and
critical exponent of conductivity.

particle in a one dimensional correlated random potential. An exact calculation
of the velocity $V$ under an applied force $f$ demonstrates a variety of
dynamic regimes depending on the range of correlations. In a gaussian potential
with correlator $C(x) = x^{\gamma}$, we find a transition from ohmic behaviour
($\gamma <0$) to creep motion $V \sim \exp(- const/f^{\mu} )$ ($0<\gamma <1$).
This provides a generic picture of the glass transition in systems where long
range correlations in the effective disorder develop due to elasticity such as
elastic manifolds subject to quenched disorder and the vortex glass transition
in superconductors.

whether one wants to fix conserved charges to a sharp value or whether one is
content to fix their thermodynamic average. In other words, contrary to the
thermodynamic limit, different statistical ensembles are not equivalent. When
treating the plasma phases of gauge field theories perturbatively in the
canonical ensemble, unexpected new difficulties arise in comparison with the
usual grand canonical treatment. The purpose of this paper is to expose these
difficulties and show how they can be remedied, thus recovering a well-defined
description of plasmas even in a finite-size, canonical ensemble setting. For
definiteness, a specific model is considered, namely QCD$_{1+1} $ with SU(2)
color; however, the treatment presented should be applicable also to
higher-dimensional systems with different types of Coulomb interaction.

states is based on applying an instant constraint to both initial and final
states in the Breit frame. This formalism is advantageous for the analysis of
electromagnetic interactions because current conservation and four momentum
conservation are realized within a three-dimensional formalism. Wave functions
are required in a frame where the total momentum is nonzero, which means that
the usual partial wave analysis is inapplicable. In this work, the
three-dimensional equation is solved numerically, taking into account the
relevant symmetries. A dynamical boost of the interaction also is needed for
the instant formalism, which in general requires that the boosted interaction
be defined as the solution of a four-dimensional equation. For the case of a
scalar separable interaction, this equation is solved and the Lorentz
invariance of the three-dimensional formulation using the boosted interaction
is verified. For more realistic interactions, a simple approximation is used to
characterize the boost of the interaction.
