gamma-ray bursts, and find no evidence for clustering on any scale. These
constraints bridge the entire range from small scales (which probe source
clustering and burst repetition) to the largest scales (which constrain
possible anisotropies from the Galactic halo or from nearby cosmological large
scale structures). We develop an analysis technique that takes the angular
position errors into account, which enables us to place tight upper limits on
the clustering down to scales l\approx 60, corresponding to a few degrees on
the sky. The minimum-variance burst weighting that we employ is graphically
visualized as an all-sky map where each burst is smeared out by an amount
corresponding to its position uncertainty. We also present separate band-pass
filtered sky maps for the quadrupole term and for the multipole-ranges l=3-10
and l=11-30, so that the fluctuations on different angular scales can be
separately inspected for visual features such as localized ``hot spots"" or
structures aligned with the Galactic plane. These filtered maps reveal no
apparent deviations from isotropy.

  figures included. Submitted to ApJ Letters",,,"CfPA-95-th-27","astro-ph",,"  We study the uncertainty in galaxy cluster mass estimates derived from X-ray
data assuming hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) for the intra cluster gas. Using a
Monte-Carlo procedure we generate a general class of mass models allowing very
massive clusters. We then compute the corresponding temperature profiles via
the HE equation and compare them to observational data on some clusters. We
find several massive clusters that pass the observational constraints, with
integrated masses varying in a quite wide range. The resulting accuracy of the
mass estimates is rather poor, larger than what is generally claimed. We argue
that the tight constraints on cluster masses previously obtained come from the
fact that a too restricted class of mass density profiles has been investigated
so far. Applying our procedure to Perseus then Coma, we find that the
improvement of the observational constraints results in a quite modest
improvement in the accuracy of the mass estimate. For Coma, using the best
current available data, we end up with a factor of two of uncertainty in the
mass within the Abell radius. This uncertainty rapidly increases at further
radius.

with relatively flat faint end ($\alpha\sim-1.0$). Galaxy counts in the B--band
exceed the prediction of such models by a factor of 2 to more than 5, forcing
the introduction of strong luminosity and/or density evolution. Recently Marzke
et al. (1994a) using the CfA redshift survey sample find that the number of
galaxies in the range $-16<M_{Zw}<-13$ exceeds the extrapolation of a flat
faint end LF by a factor of 2. Here we show that this steep LF substantially
contributes to justify the observed blue galaxy counts without invoking strong
luminosity and/or density evolution. Furthermore we show that taking into
account the variation of the $B-K$ color as a function of the morphological
types and assuming a mean value $<B-K><2.5$ for dwarf galaxies, we reproduce
well also the observed $K$--band deep galaxy counts. This assumption is
supported by the strong correlation we found between $B-K$ color of galaxies
and their infrared absolute magnitude: galaxies become bluer with decreasing
luminosity.

This paper develops a computationally tractable definition of semantic weight,

constructions which are indicative of lightness. Verbs such as ""make"" and
""take"", when they function as support verbs, are often considered to be
semantically light. To test our definition, we carried out an experiment based
on that of Grefenstette and Teufel (1995), where we automatically identify
light instances of these words in a corpus; this was done by incorporating our
frequency-related definition of semantic weight into a statistical approach
similar to that of Grefenstette and Teufel. The results show that this is a
plausible definition of semantic lightness for verbs, which can possibly be
extended to defining semantic lightness for other classes of words.

We focus especially on the top-antitop and the stop-antistop systems. The
question of the possible large corrections due to a running width of the top
quark could be solved in this work. It was shown that a previously not
considered contribution gives rise to large cancellations and leads especially
to a gauge independent result. With the help of a new zero order equation and a
Ward identity it was further possible to derive a general therorem for bound
state corrections to the width. Furthermore a systematic derivation of the
top-antitop and the stop-antistop potential to numerical order O(\alpha_s^4)
was given. In the second part of this work we consider within the numerical
Green function approach the cross sections for the production of ultraheavy
particles near threshold. The forward-backward asymmetry and the pure axial
contribution to the top-antitop total cross section as well as the
stop-antistop total cross section are calculated. A systematic method is given
to avoid unnatural cut-offs in the nonrelativistic treatment.

particularly interesting as they reveal how the sum rules resolve the spectral
properties. The use of derivative sum rules for the determination of rho-meson
spectral properties is shown to be a very unfavorable approach. Most prior
nucleon sum rule analyses are based on a sum rule which is found to be invalid;
the results are suspect, and should be reevaluated. The ``Ioffe formula'',
argued by many to qualitatively encapsulate a description of the nucleon mass
in terms of the chiral symmetry breaking order parameter is misleading at best.
QCD Sum Rules are found to be self-consistent without contributions from direct
instantons. This implies that instanton effects are adequately accounted for in
the nonperturbative vacuum condensates. This in-depth examination of QCD sum
rule self consistency paints a favorable picture for further quantitative
refinements of the QCD sum rule approach.
