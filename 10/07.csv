of disconnected quark regions during the final stages of the cosmological
quark-hadron transition. In this study, which represents a further development
of a previous analysis of the evaporation of cosmological quark drops, the
effects of long range energy and momentum transfer via electromagnetically
interacting particles are consistently taken into account. For this purpose, a
set of relativistic Lagrangian equations describing the evolution of the
strongly interacting fluids is coupled to a system of equivalent equations
accounting for the hydrodynamics of the fluid of electromagnetically
interacting particles. The complete set of equations has then been solved
numerically and results are presented from this. The inclusion of relativistic
radiative transfer produces significantly different results, with the formation
of high density regions at the end of the drop evaporation being particularly
relevant. A comparison is made with results obtained for the previous
radiation-free model and the cosmological implications concerning baryon number
concentrations are briefly discussed.

have a number of attractive features. A larger Hubble constant, which can be
compatible with the recent HST estimate, and a large fraction of baryon density

considered as a welcome feature of these models But early galaxy formation
implies that fluctuations on few megaparsec scales spent more time in the
nonlinearregime, as compared with standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) or Cold+Hot
Dark Matter models. This results in excessive clustering on small scales. We
show that a typical LCDM model with $H_0=70$ km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_0=0.3$
normalized to COBE on large scales and compatible with the number-density of
galaxy clusters, predicts a power spectrum of galaxy clustering in real space
which is too high: {\it at least} twice larger than CfA estimates (Park \etal
1994) and 3 times larger than APM estimates (Baugh \& Efstathiou 1994) for
wavenumbers $k=(0.4-1)h/{\rm Mpc}$. This conclusion holds if we assume either
that galaxies trace the dark matter ($\sigma_8\approx 1.1$ for this model) or
just that a region with higher density produces more galaxies than a region
with lower density. The only way to reconcile the model with the observed power
spectrum is to assume that regions with high dark matter density produce fewer
galaxies than regions with low density. Theoretically this is possible, but it
seems very unlikely: X-ray emission from groups and clusters indicates that
places with a large density of dark matter produce a large number of galaxies.
Since it follows that the low- $\Omega$ LCDM models are in serious trouble, we
discuss which LCDM models have the best hope of surviving the confrontation
with available observational data.

tectonic plate with long range elastic forces and quenched disorder. The plate
is driven at its border and the load is transfered to all elements through
elastic forces. This model can be considered as belonging to the class of
self-organized models which may exhibit spontaneous criticality, with four
additional ingredients compared to sandpile models, namely quenched disorder,
boundary driving, long range forces and fast time crack rules. In this
''crack'' model, as in the ''dislocation'' version previously studied, we find
that the occurrence of repeated earthquakes organizes the activity on
well-defined fault-like structures. In contrast with the ''dislocation'' model,
after a transient, the time evolution becomes periodic with run-aways ending
each cycle. This stems from the ''crack'' stress transfer rule preventing
criticality to organize in favor of cyclic behavior. For sufficiently large
disorder and weak stress drop, these large events are preceded by a complex
space-time history of foreshock activity, characterized by a Gutenberg-Richter
power law distribution with universal exponent $B=1 \pm 0.05$. This is similar
to a power law distribution of small nucleating droplets before the nucleation
of the macroscopic phase in a first-order phase transition. For large disorder
and large stress drop, and for certain specific initial disorder
configurations, the stress field becomes frustrated in fast time : out-of-plane
deformations (thrust and normal faulting) and/or a genuine dynamics must be
introduced to resolve this frustration.

electron-phonon coupling. This coupling is closely related to the vHs-JT
effect. This new insight clarifies the role of the tilt-mode instabilities. The
main JT coupling is {\it not} to these modes, but to the in-plane O-O bond
stretching modes which split the vHs degeneracy. However, as these modes
soften, they couple to the lower-lying tilt modes, so that the ultimate
instability has a finite tilt component. The bond stretch modes have a large,
linear coupling to electrons, with clear polaronic effects. A striking result
of this is that there will be a large polaronic band narrowing near the vHs,
whether or not the vHs is near the Fermi level. This vHs-localized band
narrowing provides a natural explanation for the common occurence of extended

results and synthetic tests, we quantify the systematic and the random errors.
  We also study the case of a distribution defined by two branches, each having
a power law distribution, one defined for the largest events and the other for
smaller events, with application to the World-Wide (Harvard) and Southern
California earthquake catalogs. In the case of the Harvard moment catalog, we
make more precise earlier claims of the existence of a transition of the
earthquake magnitude distribution between small and large earthquakes; the
$b$-values are $b_2 = 2.3 \pm 0.3$ for large shallow earthquakes and $b_1 =
1.00 \pm 0.02$ for smaller shallow earthquakes. However, the cross-over
magnitude between the two distributions is ill-defined. The data available at
present do not provide a strong constraint on the cross-over which has a $50\%$
probability of being between magnitudes $7.1$ and $7.6$ for shallow
earthquakes; this interval may be too conservatively estimated. Thus, any
influence of a universal geometry of rupture on the distribution of earthquakes
world-wide is ill-defined at best. We caution that there is no direct evidence
to confirm the hypothesis that the large-moment branch is indeed a power law.

the $N=4$ supersymmetric KdV equation deduced earlier by two of us (F.D. \&
E.I.) as a hamiltonian flow on $N=4$ $SU(2)$ superconformal algebra in the
harmonic $N=4$ superspace. To make this equation and the relevant hamiltonian
structures more tractable, we reformulate it in the ordinary $N=4$ and further
in $N=2$ superspaces. In $N=2$ superspace it is given by a coupled system of
evolution equations for a general $N=2$ superfield and two chiral and
antichiral superfields, and involves two independent real parameters, $a$ and
$b$. We construct a few first bosonic conserved charges in involution, of
dimensions from 1 to 6, and show that they exist only for the following choices
of the parameters: (i) $a= 4, \;b=0$; (ii) $a= -2,\; b= -6$; (iii) $a= -2, \;b=
6$. The same values are needed for the relevant evolution equations to be
bi-hamiltonian. We demonstrate that these three options are related via $SU(2)$
transformations and actually amount to the $SU(2)$ covariant integrability
condition found in the harmonic superspace approach. Our results provide a
strong evidence that the unique $N=4$ $SU(2)$ super KdV hierarchy exists. Upon
reduction to $N=2$ KdV, the above three possibilities cease to be equivalent.
They give rise to the $a=4$ and $a=-2$ $N=2$ KdV hierarchies, which thus prove
to be different truncations of the single $N=4$ $SU(2)$ KdV one.

backgrounds may not be so in their T-duals. Nevertheless, they always remain
symmetries of the underlying conformal field theory. In previous work the
mechanism by which T-duality destroys manifest supersymmetry and gives rise to
non-local realizations was found. We give the general conditions for a 2-dim
N=1 supersymmetric sigma-model to have non-local and hence non-manifest
extended supersymmetry. We then examine T-duality as a mechanism of restoring
manifest supersymmetry. This happens whenever appropriate combinations of
non-local parafermions of the underlying conformal field theory become local
due to non-trivial world-sheet effects. We present, in detail, an example
arising from the model SU(2)/U(1) X SL(2,R)/U(1) and obtain a new exact 4-dim
axionic instanton, that generalizes the SU(2) X U(1) semi-wormhole, and has
manifest spacetime as well as N=4 world-sheet supersymmetry. In addition,
general necessary conditions for abelian T-duality to preserve manifest N=4
world-sheet supersymmetry are derived and applied to WZW models based on
quaternionic groups. We also prove some theorems for sigma-models with
non-local N=4 world-sheet supersymmetry.

standard model. Inspired by Sogami's work, we present a modification of our
previous scheme to formulate the spontaneously broken gauge theory in
non-commutative geometry on the discrete space; Minkowski space multiplied by
two points space by introducing the generation mixing matrix in operation of
the generalized derivative on the more fundamental fields a_i(x,y) which
compose the gauge and Higgs fields. The standard model is reconstructed
according to the modified scheme, which does not yields not only any special
relations between the particle masses but also the special restriction on the
Higgs potential.

incorporate the strong interaction by affording the direct product internal

gauge group responsible for the strong interaction to reconstruct the standard
model and the left-right symmetric gauge model(LRSM). The approach based on
non-commutative geometry leads us to presents many attractive points such as
the unified picture of the gauge and Higgs field as the generalized connection
on the discrete space; Minkowski space multipied by N-points discrete space.
This approach leads us to unified picture of gauge and Higgs fields as the
generalized connection. The standard model needs N=2 discrete space for
reconstruction in this formalism. \lr is still alive as a model with the
intermediate symmetry of the spontaneously broken SO(10) grand unified
theory(GUT). N=3 discrete space is needed for the reconstruction of LRSM to
include two Higgs bosons $\phi$ and $\xi$ which are as usual transformed as
(2,2*,0)$ and (1,3,-2) under left-handed SU(2)x right-handed SU(2)x U(1),
respectively. xi is responsible to make the right handed-neutrino Majorana
fermion and so well explains the seesaw mechanism. Up and down quarks have the
different masses through the vacuum expectation value of phi.
