been observed in recent experiments on n-doped semiconductor superlattices with
sequential resonant tunneling. The current oscillations are caused by the
motion and recycling of the domain wall separating low- and high-electric-
field regions of the superlattice, as the analysis of a discrete drift model
shows and experimental evidence supports. Numerical simulation shows that
different nonlinear dynamical regimes of the domain wall appear when an
external microwave signal is superimposed on the dc bias and its driving
frequency and driving amplitude vary. On the frequency - amplitude parameter
plane, there are regions of entrainment and quasiperiodicity forming Arnol'd
tongues. Chaos is demonstrated to appear at the boundaries of the tongues and
in the regions where they overlap. Coexistence of up to four electric-field
domains randomly nucleated in space is detected under ac+dc driving.

independent of the details of unknown high-energy physics because the
calculation may be performed using `nice slices', for which the adiabatic
theorem may be used. If this is so, then any calculation using a manifestly
covariant --- and so slice-independent --- ultraviolet regularization must
reproduce the standard Hawking result. We investigate the dependence of the
Hawking radiation on such a short-distance regulator by calculating it using a
Pauli--Villars regularization scheme. We find that the regulator scale,
$\Lambda$, only contributes to the Hawking flux by an amount that is
exponentially small in the large variable ${\Lambda}/{T_\ssh} \gg 1$, where
$T_\ssh$ is the Hawking temperature; in agreement with Polchinski's arguments.
We also solve a technical puzzle concerning the relation between the
short-distance singularities of the propagator and the Hawking effect.

inadequate behaviour in the vicinity of their sources. Its problems with the
electron equation of motion and with non-integrable singularity of the electron
self field and of its stress tensor are well known. These inconsistencies are
eliminated if the discrete and localized (classical photons) character of the
electromagnetic interaction is anticipatively recognized already in a classical
context. This is possible, in a manifestly covariant way, with a new model of
spacetime structure, shown in a previous paper $^{1}$, that invalidates the
Lorentz-Dirac equation. For a point classical electron there is no field
singularity, no causality violation and no conflict with energy conservation in
the electron equation of motion. The electromagnetic field must be
re-interpreted in terms of average flux of classical photons. Implications of a
singularity-free formalism to field theory are discussed.
