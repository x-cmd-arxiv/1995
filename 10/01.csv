members on the EW(H\delta) versus B-R plane from existing data, and for a
larger K'-limited sample on the U-I versus I-K' plane from newly-acquired
infrared images, we demonstrate that the proportion of cluster members
undergoing secondary bursts of star formation during the last ~2 Gyr prior to
the epoch of observation is probably as high as 30 per cent of the member
galaxies. A key observation leading to this conclusion is the high proportion
of H\delta strong galaxies in all three clusters. The evolutionary modelling,
whilst necessarily approximate, returns the correct proportions of galaxies in
various stages of the star formation cycle both in terms of spectral and colour
properties. HST images for the three clusters indicate a high proportion of the
active members show signs of interaction, whereas the H\delta strong galaxies
appear mainly to be regular spheroidals. We examine results from recent merger
simulations in the context of the populations in these clusters and confirm
that the merging of individual galaxies, triggered perhaps by the hierarchical
assembly of rich clusters at this epoch, is consistent with the star formation
cycle identified in our data. The implications of such a high fraction of
active objects in cluster cores is briefly discussed.

the separation: $H_{\rm ISE} =\sum_{i\neq j} \frac{1}{[\frac{N}{\pi}
\sin(\frac{i-j}{N}\pi)]^2}(\svec_i\cdot \svec_j-\frac{1}{4})$, or ISE-model,
has received ample attention. Its special features include: relatively simple
eigenfunctions, non-interacting elementary excitations that obey semionic
statistics (spinons), and a large ``quantum group'' symmetry algebra called the
Yangian. This model is fully integrable, albeit in a slightly different sense
than the more traditional nearest neighbor exchange (NNE) Heisenberg chain.
This thesis comes in 4 chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the model and presents
the construction of a subset of the eigenfunctions. The other eigenfunctions
are shown to be generated by the action of the Yangian symmetry algebra of
$H_{\rm ISE}$. Chapter 2 presents a method to construct the set of constants of
the motion of the ISE-model. The ISE-model is tractable enough to obtain its
zero-magnetic-field dynamical structure factors. Chapter 3 attempts to extend
this to a non-zero magnetic field, where, due to the presence of spinons in the
groundstate, more complicated excitations contribute: small numbers of magnons
and spinons. discuss the relation to the more complicated NNE-model. Finally
chapter 4 illustrates how a recently conjectured new form of Off Diagonal Long
Range Order in antiferromagnetic spin chains can be reinterpreted as a spinon
propagator in the ISE-model, and verified numerically. We briefly comment on
its relevance to stabilizing superconductivity in the layered cuprates.

exact in the limit of large lattice coordination, we consider and compare two
models of correlated electrons, the Hubbard model and the periodic Anderson
model. The results are discussed in regard of recent experiments. In the
Hubbard model, we predict an anomalous enhancement optical spectral weight as a
function of temperature in the correlated metallic state which is in
qualitative agreement with optical measurements in $V_2O_3$. We argue that
anomalies observed in the spectroscopy of the metal are connected to the
proximity to a crossover region in the phase diagram of the model. In the
insulating phase, we obtain an excellent agreement with the experimental data
and present a detailed discussion on the role of magnetic frustration by
studying the $k-$resolved single particle spectra. The results for the periodic
Anderson model are discussed in connection to recent experimental data of the
Kondo insulators $Ce_3Bi_4Pt_3$ and $FeSi$. The model can successfully explain
the different energy scales that are associated to the thermal filling of the
optical gap, which we also relate to corresponding changes in the density of
states. The temperature dependence of the optical sum rule is obtained and its
relevance for the interpretation of the experimental data discussed. Finally,
we argue that the large scattering rate measured in Kondo insulators cannot be
described by the periodic Anderson model.

and Hopfield nets are frequently investigated for use in optimization,
constraint satisfaction and approximation of NP-hard problems. Nevertheless,
finding a global solution (i.e., a global minimum for the energy function) is
not guaranteed and even a local solution may take an exponential number of
steps. We propose an improvement to the standard local activation function used
for such networks. The improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is
found in linear time for tree-like subnetworks. The algorithm, called activate,
is uniform and does not assume that the network is tree-like. It can identify
tree-like subnetworks even in cyclic topologies (arbitrary networks) and avoid
local minima along these trees. For acyclic networks, the algorithm is
guaranteed to converge to a global minimum from any initial state of the system
(self-stabilization) and remains correct under various types of schedulers. On
the negative side, we show that in the presence of cycles, no uniform algorithm
exists that guarantees optimality even under a sequential asynchronous
scheduler. An asynchronous scheduler can activate only one unit at a time while
a synchronous scheduler can activate any number of units in a single time step.
In addition, no uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when
the scheduler is synchronous. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be
improved using the cycle-cutset scheme. The general algorithm, called
activate-with-cutset, improves over activate and has some performance
guarantees that are related to the size of the network's cycle-cutset.

Such systems naturally associate a ``measure of goodness'' or ``membership

primitive evaluations of different properties of the object's shape. A
membership function is used to compute the membership value when evaluating a
primitive of a particular physical property of an object. In previous versions
of a recognition system known as Gruff, the membership function for each of the
primitive evaluations was hand-crafted by the system designer. In this paper,
we provide a learning component for the Gruff system, called Omlet, that
automatically learns membership functions given a set of example objects
labeled with their desired category measure. The learning algorithm is
generally applicable to any problem in which low-level membership values are
combined through an and-or tree structure to give a final overall membership

is due to the uncertainty in the fitted $m_t$ for a fixed $m_H$ and the second
error comes from the $m_H$ in the range of $60-1000$ GeV, which is to be
compared with the current world average $M_W=80.23(18)$ GeV. The current world
average value of $M_W$ and the 1994 LEP data definitely favor nonvanishing
electroweak radiative corrections and are consistent with a heavy $m_t$ as
measured by the recent CDF report but with a heavy Higgs scalar of about 400

the errors in the best fit solutions due to the uncertainties in the gluonic
