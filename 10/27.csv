radiation damping and quantum excitation (stochastic effect), in presence of a

gives the longitudinal bunch density profile. In this framework, the
appropriate {\it r.m.s. emittance} scaling law, due to the damping effect, is
naturally recovered, and the asymptotic equilibrium condition for the bunch
length, due to the competition between quantum excitation (QE) and radiation
damping (RD), is found. This result opens the possibility to apply the TWM,
already tested for protons, to electrons, for which QE and RD are very
important.

We find that at early times higher order L(n) give an increasingly accurate

begin to turnaround and converge leading to the {\em contraction} of a Void, a
sign of pathological behaviour. By contrast particle trajectories in L(3) are
well behaved and this approximation gives results in excellent agreement with
the exact top-hat solution as long as the Void is not too underdense. For very
underdense Voids, L(3) evacuates the Void much too rapidly leading us to
conclude that the Zel'dovich approximation L(1), remains the best approximation
to apply to the late time study of Voids. The behavior of high order

non-perturbative QCD. Light-front heavy hadron bound states with definite spin
and parity are constructed and the general structure of the corresponding
wavefunctions is explored. A Gaussian-type wavefunction ansatz is used to solve
the light-front quarkonium bound state equation. We find that the effective
coupling constant determined from the quarkonium bound state equation can be
arbitrarily small so that the weak-coupling treatment to heavy hadron bound
states in light-front QCD is explicitly achieved. Finally, the scale dependence
of the effective coupling constant is analytically calculated and the
similarity renormalization group $\beta$ function is determined, from which the
running coupling constant in small momentum transfer is given qualitatively by
$\overline{\alpha}(Q^2) \sim {\Lambda_{QCD}^2 \over Q^2}$. Such a running
coupling constant is the basic assumption in the successful Richardson
$Q\overline{Q}$ potential that ensures the existence of a linear confining
potential at large distance, but now can be obtained from light-front QCD.

possibility: that of a hardly noticeable strong electroweak sector at
relatively low energies. Specifically, a model with both vector and axial
vector strong interacting bosons may possess a discrete symmetry imposing
degeneracy of the two sets of bosons (degenerate BESS model). In such a case
its effects at low energies become almost invisible and the model easily passes
all low energy precision tests. The reason lies essentially in the fact that
the model automatically satisfies decoupling, contrary to models with only
vectors. For large mass of the degenerate spin one bosons the model becomes
identical at the classical level to the standard model taken in the limit of
infinite Higgs mass. For these reasons we have thought it worthwhile to fully
develop the model, together with its possible generalizations, and to study the
expected phenomenology. For instance, just because of its invisibility at low
energy, it is conceivable that degenerate BESS has low mass spin one states and
gives quite visible signals at existing or forthcoming accelerators.

mechanics. Due to the nonlocality of the theory there is (for systems of more
than one particle) no obvious way to achieve such an extension. We present a
model invariant under a certain limit of Lorentz transformations, a limit
retaining the characteristic feature of relativity, the non-existence of
absolute time resp. simultaneity. The analysis of this model exemplifies an
important property of any Bohmian quantum theory: the quantum equilibrium
distribution $\rho = |\psi |^2$ cannot simultaneously be realized in all
Lorentz frames of reference.

"quant-ph/9510028",,"Lajos Diosi","A True Equation to Couple Classical and Quantum Dynamics","8pp LaTeX",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Starting from the Schr\""odinger-equation of a composite system, we derive
unified dynamics of a classical harmonic system coupled to an arbitrary
quantized system. The classical subsystem is described by random phase-space
coordinates entangled with the quantized variables of the complementary
subsystem. Our semiclassical equation is {\it true} in a sense that its
predictions are identical to those of the fully quantized composite dynamics.
This exact method applies to a broad class of theories, including e.g. the
relativistic quantum-electrodynamics and the electron-fonon dynamics.

Phys","Am.J.Phys.64:944-953,1996","10.1119/1.18304","IUHET 308, July 1995","quant-ph",,"  Localized quantum wave packets can be produced in a variety of physical
systems and are the subject of much current research in atomic, molecular,
chemical, and condensed-matter physics. They are particularly well suited for
studying the classical limit of a quantum-mechanical system. The motion of a
localized quantum wave packet initially follows the corresponding classical
motion. However, in most cases the quantum wave packet spreads and undergoes a
series of collapses and revivals. We present a generic treatment of wave-packet
evolution, and we provide conditions under which various types of revivals
occur in ideal form. The discussion is at a level appropriate for an advanced
undergraduate or first-year graduate course in quantum mechanics. Explicit
examples of different types of revival structure are provided, and physical
applications are discussed.
