  We suggest that two of the ionized components are associated with the central

vary for different emission lines. Both results are consistent with the radio
components representing the working surfaces of a pair of jets emerging from
the centre of the galaxy. In this scenario, the optical emission in the centre
arises behind the bowshocks produced by the jets in the interstellar medium.
  The emission lines are detected and show a dramatic (~ 900 km/s) spread in
velocity at the position of the radio lobe hotspots. We suggest a model which
explains this phenomenon as the result of a jet head emerging through the

has previously been suggested as a model to explain wide angle tail radio

systematically low within the central several hundred parsecs of the Galaxy.
The observational results indicate that the abundance of the C+ ions themselves

UV radiation with fewer C-ionizing photons. This soft radiation field, together
with the pervasively high molecular gas density, makes the molecular
self-shielding more effective in the Galactic center. The self-shielding
further reduces the abundance of C+ ions, and raises the temperature of
molecular gas at the C+/C/CO transition zone.

corrections to the standard bubble-chain diagrams. High-order corrections allow
one to choose a scheme in which the coupling evolution can smoothly be
extrapolated to small momenta. In such schemes the sum of an (extended)
IR-renormalon asymptotic series is defined as an integral of the running
coupling over the IR region. We give explicit examples of renormalization
schemes in QCD which can be used for summing IR-renormalon asymptotic series

Gribov horizon {\it and} of the dependence of the observables on derivatives of
the super-ghost field. By requiring the absence of global BRS anomalies, it is
nevertheless possible to associate global forms to correlators of observables
by resorting to the \v{C}ech-De Rham notion of form cohomology. To this end, we
derive and solve the ``descent'' of local Ward identities which characterize
the functional measure. We obtain in this way an explicit expression for the
\v{C}ech-De Rham cocycles corresponding to arbitrary correlators of
observables. This provides the way to compute and understand contact terms in
string theory from first principles.
