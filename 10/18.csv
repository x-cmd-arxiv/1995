The beam coupling impedances due to a small discontinuity on the chamber wall
of an accelerator can also be expressed in terms of the polarizabilities of the
discontinuity. The polarizabilities are geometrical factors which can be found
by solving a static (electric or magnetic) problem. However, they are known in
an explicit analytical form only for a few simple-shaped discontinuities, such
as an elliptic hole in a thin wall. In the present paper the polarizabilities
of a ring-shaped cut in the wall of an arbitrary thickness are studied using a
combination of analytical, variational and numerical methods. The results are
applied to estimate the coupling impedances of button-type beam position

formation over a few Gyr period. We have also found an interesting difference
between the burst stellar population of the SBNGs and the HII galaxies: SBNGs
have an excess of intermediate-mass stars as compared to HII galaxies. We
interpreted this difference as a sign that SBNGs have experienced a higher
frequency of bursts of star formation than the HII galaxies. This
interpretation is qualitatively consistent with the Stochastic Self Propagation
of Star Formation (SSPSF) theory, which suggests that the starburst phenomenon
depends on internal processes, regulated by the evolution of massive stars.

We develop a hydrodynamic theory of fluid bilayers in interaction with the
surrounding water and argue that the effect of the laser is to induce a sudden
tension in the membrane. We refine our previous analysis to account for the
fact that the shape transformation is not uniform but propagates outward from
the laser trap. Applying the marginal stability criterion to this situation
gives us an improved prediction for the selected initial wavelength and a new
prediction for the propagation velocity, both in rough agreement with the
experimental values. For example, a tubule of initial radius 0.7\micron\ has a
predicted initial sinusoidal perturbation in its diameter with wavelength
5.5\micron, as observed. The perturbation propagates as a front with the
qualitatively correct front velocity a bit less than 100\micron/sec. In
particular we show why this velocity is initially constant, as observed, and so
much smaller than the natural scale set by the tension. We also predict that
the front velocity should increase linearly with laser power. Finally we
introduce an approximate hydrodynamic model applicable to the fully nonlinear
regime. This model exhibits propagating fronts as well as fully-developed
``pearled"" vesicles similar to those seen in the experiments.

ratios extracted from loops in various group representations are proportional
to the quadratic Casimir of each representation, in a distance interval from
the confinement scale to the point where color screening sets in. In contrast
we find numerically, in the same interval, that string tensions extracted from
loops built from abelian projected configurations are the same for the

which follows from the standard theorems of homological perturbation theory,
holds not only in the algebra of local functions, but also in the space of
local functionals. The present paper stresses how important it is that the
antifields in question be the usual antifields associated with the gauge
invariant description. By means of explicit counterexamples drawn from the free
Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system, we show that the property does not hold, in the
case of local functionals, if one replaces the antifields of the gauge
invariant description by new antifields adapted to the gauge fixation. In terms

provide a solution to both the gauge hierarchy and the fine-tuning problems.
However, because of strongly interacting dynamics, it is in general impossible
to analyze them quantitatively. One of the few models with calculable dynamical
supersymmetry breaking is a model with SU(5) gauge symmetry and two $10$'s and
two $\bar 5$'s as the matter content. We determine the ground state of this
model, find the vacuum energy, reveal the symmetry breaking pattern and
calculate the mass spectrum. The supertrace mass relation is exploited to
verify the consistency of the calculated mass spectrum, and an accidental
