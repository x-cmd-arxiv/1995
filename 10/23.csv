the nonlinear evolution of unstable sheared magnetohydrodynamic flows. We
considered two cases: a strong magnetic field (Alfven Mach number, M_a = 2.5)
and a weak field (M_a =5). Each flow rapidly evolves until it reaches a nearly
steady condition, which is fundamentally different from the analogous
gasdynamic state. Both MHD flows relax to a stable, laminar flow on timescales
less than or of the order of 15 linear growth times, measured from saturation
of the instability. That timescale is several orders of magnitude less than the
nominal dissipation time for these simulated flows, so this condition
represents an quasi-steady relaxed state. The strong magnetic field case
reaches saturation as magnetic tension in the displaced flow boundary becomes
sufficient to stabilize it. That flow then relaxes in a straightforward way to
the steady, laminar flow condition. The weak magnetic field case, on the other
hand, begins development of the vortex expected for gasdynamics, but that
vortex is destroyed by magnetic stresses that locally become strong. Magnetic
topologies lead to reconnection and dynamical alignment between magnetic and
velocity fields. Together these processes produce a sequence of intermittent
vortices and subsequent relaxation to a nearly laminar flow condition in which
the magnetic cross helicity is nearly maximized. Remaining irregularities
consist of a pair of flux tubes straddling the shear layer. Fluctuations within
those features are closely aligned, representing Alfv\'en waves propagating
locally downstream.

  with Deformable Interface","27 pages LaTeX, 8 figures (figure 8 in separate file), all uuencoded",,,,"patt-sol nlin.PS",,"  The stability of Marangoni roll convection in a liquid-gas system with
deformable interface is studied in the case when there is a nonlinear
interaction between two modes of Marangoni instability: long-scale surface
deformations and short-scale convection. Within the framework of a model
derived previously, it is shown that the nonlinear interaction between the two
modes substantially changes the width of the band of stable wave numbers of the
short-scale convection pattern as well as the type of the instability limiting
the band. Depending on the parameters of the system, the instability can be
either long- or short-wave, either monotonic or oscillatory. The stability
boundaries strongly differ from the standard ones and sometimes exclude the
band center. The long-wave limit of the side-band instability is studied in
detail within the framework of the phase approximation. It is shown that the
monotonic instability is always subcritical, while the long-wave oscillatory
instability can be supercritical, leading to the formation of either travelling
or standing waves modulating the pattern wavelength and the surface
deformation.

  Workshop ""Methods of Mathematical Physics"", Rakhov, 1995, september 11-17",,,,"solv-int hep-th nlin.SI",,"  A construction of integrable hamiltonian systems associated with different
graded realizations of untwisted loop algebras is proposed. Such systems have
the form of Euler - Arnold equations on orbits of loop algebras. The proof of
completeness of the integrals of motion is carried out independently of the
realization of the loop algebra. The hamiltonian systems obtained are shown to
coincide with hierarchies of higher stationary equations for some nonlinear
PDE's integrable by inverse scattering method.
  We apply the general scheme for the principal and homogeneous realizations of
the loop algebra $ sl_3(\R)\otimes{\cal P}(\lambda,\lambda^{-1}) $. The
corresponding equations on the degenerated orbit are interpreted as the
Boussinesq's and two-component modified KDV equations respectively. The scalar
Lax representation for the Boussinesq's equation is found in terms of
coordinates on the orbit applying the Drinfeld - Sokolov reduction procedure.
