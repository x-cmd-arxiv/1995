from observations of damped Ly$\alpha$ clouds, we calculate the evolution of
star formation rates and elemental abundances in the universe. For most
observables our calculations are in rough agreement with previous results based
on the instantaneous re-cycling approximation (IRA). However, for the key
metallicity tracer Zn, we find a better match to the observed abundance at high
redshift than that given by the constant-yield IRA model. We investigate
whether the redshift evolution of deuterium, depressions in the diffuse
extragalactic gamma-ray background, and measurement of the MeV neutrino
background may help determine if observational bias due to dust obscuration is
important. We also indicate how the importance of dust on the calculations can
be significantly reduced if correlations of the HI column density with
metallicity are present. The possibilities for measuring $q_o$ with
observations of elemental abundances in damped Ly$\alpha$ systems are
discussed.

fluctuations are identified~: first, self-similar solutions propagating from
large to small scales and building up intermittency, second, complex time
singularities inhibiting the cascade and promoting chaos. A simple and robust
method is proposed to track these objects. It is shown that the scaling
exponent of self-similar solutions selected by the dynamics is compatible with
large order statistics whenever it departs enough from the Kolmogorov value.
Complex time singularities on the other hand get trapped on the last shells,
when the proportion of Novikov interactions exceeds a critical value which is
argued to mark the boundary between chaotic and regular dynamics in the limit

complex dynamical variables per shell, transporting positive and negative
helicity respectively. The dynamical equations are derived from a decomposition
into helical modes of the velocity Fourier components of Navier-Stokes
equations (F. Waleffe, Phys. Fluids A {\bf 4}, 350 (1992)). This decomposition
leads to four different types of shell models, according to the possible
non-equivalent combinations of helicities of the three interacting modes in
each triad. Free parameters are fixed by imposing the conservation of energy
and of a ``generalized helicity'' $H_\alpha$ in the inviscid and unforced
limit. For $\alpha=1$ this non-positive invariant looks exactly like helicity
in the Fourier-helical decomposition of the Navier-Stokes equations. Long
numerical integrations are performed, allowing the computation of the scaling
exponents of the velocity increments and energy flux moments. The dependence of
the models on the generalized helicity parameter $\alpha$ and on the scale
parameter $\lambda$ is also studied. PDEs are finally derived in the limit when
the ratio between shells goes to one.

is discussed. We derive with the energy-Casimir stability method the nonlinear
stability of this solution in the inviscid case as a function of the solution
parameters and of the domain size. We exhibit the maximum size of the domain
for which the vortex street is stable. By adapting a numerical time-stepping
code, we calculate the linear stability of the Mallier-Maslowe solution in the
presence of viscosity and compensating forcing. Finally, the results are
discussed and compared to a recent experiment in fluids performed by Tabeling
et al.~[Europhysics Letters {\bf 3}, 459 (1987)]. Electromagnetically driven
counter-rotating vortices are unstable above a critical electric current, and
give way to co-rotating vortices. The importance of the friction at the bottom
of the experimental apparatus is also discussed.

are solved by the spectral transform method on the semi-line. As the problem
has a free end, the pump and Stokes output at finite distance can be
constructed as the solution of a linear Cauchy-Green integral equation.
