peculiar--velocity field superimposed on a homogeneous and isotropic Hubble
expansion, we apply (Lagrangian) spatial averaging on an arbitrary domain $\cal
D$ to the (nonlinear) equations of Newtonian cosmology and derive an exact,
general equation for the evolution of the (domain dependent) scale factor
$a_{\cal D}(t)$. We consider the effect of inhomogeneities on the average
expansion and discuss under which circumstances the standard description of the
average motion in terms of Friedmann's equation holds. We find that this effect
vanishes for spatially compact models if one averages over the whole space. For
spatially infinite inhomogeneous models obeying the cosmological principle of
large--scale isotropy and homogeneity, Friedmann models may provide an
approximation to the average motion on the largest scales, whereas for
hierarchical (Charlier--type) models the general expansion equation shows how
inhomogeneities might appreciably affect the expansion at all scales. An
averaged vorticity evolution law is also given. Since we employ spatial
averaging, the problem of justifying ensemble averaging does not arise. A
generalization of the expansion law to general relativity is straightforward
for the case of irrotational flows and will be discussed. The effect may have
important consequences for a variety of problems in large--scale structure
modeling as well as for the interpretation of observations.

low-redshift $(z<0.2)$ ROSAT PSPC clusters (Buote \& Tsai 1996) indicating that
the detailed evolution of individual simulated clusters is consistent with
observed clusters. However, the distribution of simulated clusters (for
$\Omega=1$ standard Cold Dark Matter) along the evolutionary track at the
present epoch, which indicates a measure of the present balance of cluster
formation and relaxation rates, suggests that there are too many simulated
clusters with significant amounts of substructure to be consistent with the
observations, thus favoring a lower value of $\Omega$. Perpendicular to the
evolutionary track the distributions of observed and simulated clusters are
consistent which may indicate a success of the cosmological model (e.g., power
spectrum). Analysis of high-redshift simulated clusters suggests that the
distribution of clusters both along and perpendicular to the evolutionary track
is effectively constant from $z\sim 0.6$ to the present but changes
significantly for $z > 0.6$.

unbiased and has a standard deviation of 14-29%. The scatter can be
considerably reduced (to 8-15%) by using an alternative mass estimator that

elimination of the variance contributed by the gas outer slope parameter. We

three competing reactions $A+A\rightarrow\emptyset$, $B+B\rightarrow\emptyset$,
and $A+B\rightarrow\emptyset$. Asymptotic density decay rates are calculated
for $d\leq 2$ using two separate methods - the Smoluchowski approximation, and
also field theoretic/renormalisation group (RG) techniques. Both approaches
predict power law decays, with exponents which asymptotically depend only on
the ratio of diffusion constants, and not on the reaction rates. Furthermore,
we find that, for $d<2$, the Smoluchowski approximation and the RG improved
tree level give identical exponents. However, whereas the Smoluchowski approach
cannot easily be improved, we show that the RG provides a systematic method for
incorporating additional fluctuation effects. We demonstrate this advantage by
evaluating one loop corrections for the exponents in $d<2$, and find good
agreement with simulations and exact results.

method of self-adjoint extension of singular potentials, which avoids explicit

coupling constant \alpha increases, the bound state spectrum undergoes an
abrupt change at the critical value \alpha = \alpha_c = 1/2. For \alpha >
\alpha_c, the mass spectrum displays, in addition to the existing states for
\alpha < \alpha_c, a new set of an infinite number of bound states concentrated
in a narrow band starting at mass W=0. In the limit \alpha going to \alpha_c
from above, these states shrink to a single massless state with a mass gap with
the rest of the spectrum. This state has the required properties to represent a
Goldstone boson and to signal a spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry. It is
suggested that the critical coupling constant \alpha_c be viewed as a possible
candidate for an ultra- violet stable fixed point of QED, with a distinction
between two phases, joined to each other by a first-order chiral phase
transition.

behaviour in the infrared, in the sense of leading to the existence of a
non-trivial (quasi) fixed point that lies between the trivial fixed point (at
infinite momenta) and the region where dynamical symmetry breaking and mass
generation occurs. This quasi-fixed point structure implies slowly varying,
rather than fixed, couplings in the intermediate regime of momenta, a situation
which resembles that of (four-dimensional) `walking technicolour' models of
particle physics. The inclusion of wave-function renormalization yields
marginal $O(1/N)$-corrections to the `bulk' non-fermi liquid behaviour caused
by the gauge interaction in the limit of infinite flavour number. Such
corrections lead to the appearance of modified critical exponents. In
particular, at low temperatures there appear to be logarithmic scaling
violations of the linear resistivity of the system of order $O(1/N)$.
Connection with the anomalous normal-state properties of certain condensed
matter systems relevant for high-temperature superconductivity is briefly
discussed. The relevance of the large (flavour) $N$ expansion to the

point out the absence of Charge-Density-Wave Instabilities from the effective

Particular emphasis is put on the weak-neutral longitudinal response function,
since this observable displays a strong sensitivity to isospin correlations:
specifically, it is shown how, through a diagrammatic cancellation/filtration
mechanism, this response acts as a magnifier of pionic correlations in the
nuclear medium. The parity-violating longitudinal response function also
displays appreciable sensitivity to the electric strangeness content of the
nucleon, thus making quasielastic electron scattering a possible candidate to
measure the nucleon electric strange form factor at relatively high momentum
transfers. Finally, we discuss how observables, related to the asymmetry, can
