uncertain is the contribution of the Galactic disk to the local circular speed,
which affects the normalisation and size of the Galactic halo. Despite all the

measurement require us to first smooth the velocity field as observed on a
3-dimensional support (i.e. the galaxy positions) inhomogeneously distributed
throughout the sampled volume. The wavelet formalism permits us to introduce a
minimal smoothing procedure that is characterized by the variation in size of
the smothing window function. Moreover the output smoothed radial velocity
field can be shown to correspond to a well defined theoretical quantity as long
as the spatial sampling support satisfies certain criteria. We argue also that
one should be very cautious when comparing the velocity potential derived from
such a smoothed radial component of the velocity field with related quantities

nonlinear structures, (2) proper motion of nonlinear structures, and (3) late

temperature anisotropies are obtained by numerically evolving matter
inhomogeneities and CMB photons from an early, linear epoch ($z=100$) to the

scale of the underlying matter (voids, superclusters) and as a function of
$\Omega_{0}$. The results of the $\Omega_{0}<1$ models are compared to a
similarly executed $\Omega_{0}=1.0$ simulation. We find that in low density
models all three sources of anisotropy could be relevant and reach levels of
$\Delta T/T \sim 10^{-6}$. In particular, we find that for $\Omega_{0}<1$ at

used during the calibration step of the relation and the step of the
determination of the distances of galaxies, standard statistical methods such
as the maximum likelihood technic permits us to derive bias free estimators of
the distances of galaxies. However in practice, it is convenient to use a
different statistical model for calibrating the Tully-Fisher relation (because
of its robustness, the Inverse Tully-Fisher relation is prefered during this
step) and for determining the distances of galaxies (the Direct Tully-Fisher
relation is more accurate and robust in this case). Herein, we establish a
correspondence between the Inverse and the Direct Tully-Fisher approaches.
Assuming a gaussian luminosity function, we prove that the ITF and DTF models
are in fact mathematically equivalent (i.e. they describe the same physical
data distribution in the TF diagram). It thus turns out that as long as the
calibration parameters are obtained for a given model, we can deduce the
corresponding parameters of the other model. We present these formulae of
correspondence and discuss their validitity for non-gaussian luminosity
functions.

We study the spectrum of quantum fluctuations of the bubble wall and confirm

transverse traceless fluctuations of the bubble wall. This super-curvature mode
could in principle distort the anisotropy of the microwave background. We
compute the amplitude of the gauge invariant metric perturbations induced by
the bubble wall fluctuations on a comoving hypersurface, and calculate the
induced amplitude of temperature fluctuations in the microwave background, for
arbitrary values of $\Omega_0$. We find that in the limit $\Omega_0\simeq 1$,
the quadrupole dominates the angular power spectrum, like in the usual
Grishchuk-Zel'dovich effect. The resulting bounds on the amplitude of quantum

by obtaining the eigenvalues and the spectral radius of the iteration matrix.
This establishes that the nonconvergence is due to inaccuracies of the
asymptotic approximations for the matrix elements for accidentally close
boundary element pairs on different spheres. This difficulty is cured by
checking for boundary element pairs closer than the typical spatial extent of
the boundary elements and for those pairs performing an `in-line' Monte Carlo

from the exchange of scalar and vector mesons. The main new feature of our work
is the treatment of the scale breaking of quantum chromodynamics through the
introduction of a dilaton field. Although the dilaton effects are quite small
quantitatively, they affect the high-temperature phase transition appreciably.
We find that inclusion of the dilaton leads to a metastable high-density state
at zero pressure, similar to that found by Glendenning who considered instead
the admixture of higher baryon resonances.

description of Peter-Weyl type decomposition.

gravity effects due to abrupt conformational changes of the MT protein dimers,
and we propose a new mechanism for memory coding.

  Mangalia, Romania",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The agenda of quantum algorithmic information theory, ordered `top-down,' is
the quantum halting amplitude, followed by the quantum algorithmic information
content, which in turn requires the theory of quantum computation. The
fundamental atoms processed by quantum computation are the quantum bits which
are dealt with in quantum information theory. The theory of quantum computation
will be based upon a model of universal quantum computer whose elementary unit
is a two-port interferometer capable of arbitrary $U(2)$ transformations. Basic
to all these considerations is quantum theory, in particular Hilbert space
quantum mechanics.
