example of such an embedding is the formal completion \frak{X} = Y_{/X} where X

calculate algebraic De Rham (co)homology. Our main application is an explicit
construction of the Grothendieck residue complex when S is a regular scheme. By
definition the residue complex is the Cousin complex of \pi^{!} \cal{O}_{S}. We
start with Huang's theory of pseudofunctors on modules with 0-dimensional
support, which provides a graded sheaf \cal{K}^{.}_{X/S}. We then use smooth
formal embeddings to obtain the coboundary operator on \cal{K}^{.}_{X / S}. We
exhibit a canonical isomorphism between the complex (\cal{K}^{.}_{X/S}, \delta)

dimension n and generically smooth we show that H^{-n} \cal{K}^{.}_{X/S} is
canonically isomorphic to the sheaf of regular differentials of Kunz-Waldi.
Another issue we discuss is Grothendieck Duality on a noetherian formal scheme

measurement error, related to the finite number of sampling cells, is
disentangled from the ``cosmic error'', due to the finiteness of the survey.
Using the hierarchical model and assuming locally Poisson behavior, we
identified three contributions to the cosmic error:
  The finite volume effect is proportional to the average of the two-point
correlation function over the whole survey. It accounts for possible
fluctuations of the density field at scales larger than the sample size.
  The edge effect is related to the geometry of the survey. It accounts for the
fact that objects near the boundary carry less statistical weight than those
further away from it.
  The discreteness effect is due to the fact that the underlying smooth random
field is sampled with finite number of objects. This is the ``shot noise''
error.
  Measurements of errors in artificial hierarchical samples showed excellent
agreement with our predictions. The probability distribution of errors is
increasingly skewed when the order $N$ and/or the cell size increases. The
Gaussian approximation is valid only in the weakly non-linear regime, otherwise
it severely underestimates the true errors. We study the concept of ``number of
statistically independent cells'' This number is found to depend highly on the
statistical object under study and is generally quite different from the number
of cells needed to cover the survey volume. In light of these findings, we
advocate high oversampling for measurements of counts in cells.

  The observed luminosity of a Type II supernova depends on the unknown
inclination angle. Spectral analysis alone will fail to detect even strong
deviations from spherical symmetry. Line scattering depolarizes incident
polarized light, but the residual intrinsic polarization does not completely
vanish because of electron scattering effects that depend on the electron
density distribution. By combining results on the polarization and velocity
structure of the emission lines, and the degree of polarization in the
continuum, we place strong constraints on the degree of asphericity, the
inclination of the system and the electron density distribution.
  Both the flux spectra and the percentage of polarization as a function of
wavelength can be reproduced by an aspherical model with an axis ratio of 0.6,
radial electron densities proportional to r**-5 and an effective temperature of
4800 K. In an oblate model, SN1993J is seen almost equator on. The line forming
region is still within the hydrogen rich part of the envelope after 3 weeks,
although the continuum may form in deeper layers. Although the residual
polarization across Halpha is not zero, the interstellar component derived
herein is consistent with that deduced by Trammell et al.(1993). The power of
this technique for investigating the structure of other SN II, as a method for
independently deriving the interstellar polarization, and the implications of

effects of burst strength from burst age in a spectrum comprised of a
post-starburst population and an underlying old galaxy population. To test the
technique we have measured spectral indices in the observed spectra of three
post-starburst early-type galaxies. The three galaxies are shown to have
different post-starburst ages, ranging from 0 Gyr to 1.5 Gyr after completion
of the burst. We also demonstrate that if the burst contributes greater than
50\% of the light at 4000 \AA \ then the technique can distinguish between a
post-starburst systems and models in which a constant star formation history is
suddenly truncated, such as that which could occur in a spiral that is rapidly
stripped of its interstellar medium. Finally, we demonstrate that while the

of a starburst (up until 2 Gyr after the end of the burst), the derived
termination times are relatively insensitive to the duration of the burst.

emission from relativistic electrons which are diffusively accelerated at the
expanding supernova shock. This model was originally developed for application
to the optically thin emission observed from SN1987A. Here we generalise it by
including the effects of free-free absorption from both an external screen and
from material internal to the source, and by relaxing the restriction to an
azimuthal B-field. We find a good fit to the entire set of radio data for the
best observed highly-luminous RSN -- SN1986J -- with a reduced \chi^2 of 3.85.
Applying the new model to SN1988Z, another intrinsically bright RSN, also
yields a good fit (\chi^2_{\rm red}\approx 2) but this is less significant,
because of the limited data on this distant (z=0.02) source. These fits suggest
that the shock expands at constant speed, that the magnetic field within the
source decreases with time according to t^{-2}, and that the compression ratio
of the shock front is close to the value expected of a strong shock in an ideal
gas of adiabatic index 5/3 -- indicating a relatively low value of the cosmic
ray pressure compared with SN1987A. In the case of SN1986J we derive an
explosion date in August/September 1982, a magnetic field at the position of
the shock 1000 days after explosion of 4nT and a spatial diffusion coefficient
of the electrons of 4 10^{19} cm^2/s, four orders of magnitude greater than the
Bohm value. In addition, we obtain the optical depths to external and internal

effect in mirror-symmetric turbulence in a shearing flow can generate a large
scale, coherent magnetic field. We illustrate this effect with simulations of a
few simple systems. In accretion disks, this process can lead to axisymmetric
magnetic domains whose radial and vertical dimensions will be comparable to the
disk height. This process may be responsible for observations of dynamo
activity seen in simulations of dynamo-generated turbulence involving, for
example, the Balbus-Hawley instability. In this case the magnetic field
strength will saturate at $\sim (h/r)^2$ times the ambient pressure in real
accretion disks. The resultant dimensionless viscosity will be of the same
order. In numerical simulations the azimuthal extent of the simulated annulus
should be substituted for $r$. We compare the predictions of this model to
numerical simulations previously reported by Brandenburg et al. (1995). In a
radiation pressure dominated environment this estimate for viscosity should be
reduced by a factor of $(P_{gas}/P_{radiation})^6$ due to magnetic buoyancy.

Toulouse limit of the ordinary Kondo problem. In this limit, the effective
Hamiltonian can be exactly solved, with a mixed valence quantum critical point
separating two different Fermi liquid phases, {\it i.e.} the Kondo phase and
the empty orbital phase. In the mixed valence quantum critical regime, the
local moment is only partially quenched and X-ray edge singularities are
generated. Around the quantum critical point, a new type of non-Fermi liquid

reduced heavy quark Dirac equation. For the Forward Time - Centered Space
discretization, the renormalization is computed both perturbatively, to one
loop, and non-perturbatively using an ensemble of lattices provided by the

shows that the $S^2\times S^2$ bubbles can be interpreted as closed loops of
virtual black holes. It is shown that scattering in such topological
fluctuations leads to loss of quantum coherence, or in other words, to a

that the $\theta $ angle of QCD is zero without having to invoke the
problematical existence of a light axion. The picture of virtual black holes
given here also suggests that macroscopic black holes will evaporate down to

superdeformed bands in Hg and Pb isotopes is applied to the study of
superdeformed bands in Gd150, Dy152, Dy151 and Tb151. The same
density-dependent zero-range pairing interaction used in the A=190 mass region
leads to a similarly good agreement with the experimental data. In particular,
our results confirm the importance of a correct treatment of pairing
correlations in Gd150 to reproduce its experimental dynamical moment of
inertia. The quasi-particle spectra obtained for all the nuclei studied here
are compatible with the experimental results obtained for excited bands in this
mass region. The quality of our results opens the possibility of studying
microscopically very subtle phenomena like the properties of identical bands.

1-d lattice of coupled sine circle maps. We carry out an analytic stability
analysis of this spatially synchronized and temporally periodic case and obtain
the stability matrix in a neat block diagonal form. We find spatially
synchronized behaviour over a substantial range of parameter space. We have
also extended the analysis to higher spatial periods with similar results.
Numerical simulations for various temporal periods of the synchronized
solution, reveal that the entire structure of the Arnold tongues and the
devil's staircase seen in the case of the single circle map can also be
observed for the synchronized coupled sine circle map lattice. Our formalism
should be useful in the study of spatially periodic behaviour in other coupled
map lattices.

  incompatibility removed, reference added",,"10.1063/1.531662",,"q-alg gr-qc math-ph math.MP math.QA",,"  Two toy models are considered within the framework of noncommutative
differential geometry. In the first one, the Einstein action of the Levi-Civita
connection is computed for the algebra of matrix valued functions on a torus.
It is shown that, assuming some constraints on the metric, this action splits
into a classical-like, a quantum-like and a mixed term. In the second model, an
analogue of the Palatini method of variation is applied to obtain critical
points of the Einstein action functional for $M\sb 4(R)$. It is pointed out
that a solution to the Palatini variational problem is not necessarily a
Levi-Civita connection. In this model, no additional assumptions regarding
metrics are made.

categories is proved provided B is a Hopf algebra (with invertible antipode).
Bialgebra projections and Hopf bimodule bialgebras over a Hopf algebra in C are
found to be isomorphic categories. As a consequence a generalization of the
Radford-Majid criterion for a braided Hopf algebra to be a cross product is
obtained. The results of this paper turn out to be fundamental for the
construction of (bicovariant) differential calculi on braided Hopf algebras.

distinct parallel worlds as a result of a quantum mechanical measurement.
Communication among these parallel worlds would experimentally rule out
alternatives to this interpretation. A procedure for ``interworld'' exchange of
information and energy, using only state of the art quantum optical equipment,
is described. A single ion is isolated from its environment in an ion trap.
Then a quantum mechanical measurement with two discrete outcomes is performed
on another system, resulting in the formation of two parallel worlds. Depending
on the outcome of this measurement the ion is excited from only one of the
parallel worlds before the ion decoheres through its interaction with the
environment. A detection of this excitation in the other parallel world is
direct evidence for the many-worlds interpretation. This method could have
important practical applications in physics and beyond.
