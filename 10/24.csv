general relations between the matter and cosmic microwave background (CMB)
power spectra and their dependence on cosmological parameters on small scales.
Fluctuations in the CMB, baryons, cold dark matter (CDM), and neutrinos receive
a boost at horizon crossing. Baryon drag on the photons causes alternating
acoustic peak heights in the CMB and is uncovered in its bare form under the
photon diffusion scale. Decoupling of the photons at last scattering and of the
baryons at the end of the Compton drag epoch, freezes the diffusion-damped
acoustic oscillations into the CMB and matter power spectra at different
scales. We determine the dependence of the respective acoustic amplitudes and
damping lengths on fundamental cosmological parameters. The baryonic
oscillations, enhanced by the velocity overshoot effect, compete with CDM
fluctuations in the present matter power spectrum. We present new exact
analytic solutions for the cold dark matter fluctuations in the presence of a
growth- inhibiting radiation {\it and} baryon background. Combined with the
acoustic contributions and baryonic infall into CDM potential wells, this
provides a highly accurate analytic form of the small-scale transfer function
in the general case.

  3. Accepted for publication in A&A",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The 3-body crystallization diagrams of C/O/Ne ionic mixtures characteristic
of white dwarf interiors are examined within the framework of the
density-functional theory of freezing. The crystallization process is described
more accurately than in former calculations where the three-component system
was treated as an effective two-component mixture (Segretain et al. 1994). The
distillation process due to neon-crystallization is found to occur only for the
late stages of crystallization. At the beginning, the presence of neon plays
only a minor role and the phase diagram resembles a pure carbon-oxygen diagram.
The final phase diagram is found to exhibit an azeotropic point with a neon
concentration $x_{Ne}=0.22$, a carbon concentration $x_{C}=0.78$ and an oxygen
concentration $x_O=0$, so that during the distillation process, the fluid
crystallizes into a pure neon-carbon solid. The critical temperature is
$T_A=0.85\,T_C$, where $T_C$ is the pure carbon crystallization temperature. We
use this accurate phase diagram to calculate the total gravitational energy
released during white dwarf crystallization and the related time delay. The
final result yields $\Delta \tau \approx 2.6$ Gyr, among which about 20\% are
due to the neon-distillation process.

temperature of 8150 K, where literature quotes spectral type F0I. The Doppler

(2500-3000ang) show a relation with the line optical depth. This suggests an
expanding accelerating wind, c.q. pseudo-photosphere. The relation is extended
by a factor 10^5 in optical depth by using available data from optical HeI and

specie. On the basis of the expansion velocity, rotational temperatures, and
molecular column densities we argue that the line-forming region is the AGB
remnant. This is in agreement with the expansion velocity derived from the CO
lines. We find column densities of log N_C2=15.3+-0.3 cm-2 and log
N_CN=15.5+-0.3 cm-2, and rotational temperatures of T_rot=242+-20 K and
T_rot=24+-5 K respectively for C2 and CN. By studying molecular line absorption
in optical spectra of post-AGB stars we have found a new tracer of the AGB

possible to obtain information on non-spherical behavior of the AGB remnant.
Using different molecules with different excitation conditions it should be

problem in strong magnetic field, and obtain an approximate, but complete

for $B>>B_{crit}$, there is an orthogonal set of bound states, which do not

increases, the statistical weight due to transverse motion is actually
increased by the strong magnetic field. For astrophysically interesting case of

ones ever studied. On larger scales, the X-ray distribution is elliptical and
locally distorted by a significant ``sub-structure"" located some 100 $h^{-1}$
kpc from the center. The mass of this sub-structureis estimated to be $\sim$
1/20 of the total cluster mass and appears tobe associated with an enhancement
in the galaxy distribution, in the region where the giant ``straight arc"" and
several arclets are observed. A simple lens model basedon the geometrical
properties of the X-ray gas shows that this sub-structure allows to explain in
a simple manner the peculiar shape of the arc and puts strong constraints on
the total mass distribution in the central part of this cluster. The derived
M/L in the central part of the cluster is found to be around 250 in solar
units, a rather common value compared with other cluster-lenses. Moreover, the
link between the matter distribution derived from the lens model and the
density profile issued from the X-ray map analysis is used to infer the
temperature profile in the cluster. This profile shows a significant decrease

the generators corresponding to the punctures into the corresponding conjugacy

this bound by a dedicated experimental analysis. We study the constraints this

models where new gauge bosons are coupled dominantly to the third generation,

ocurred is via nucleation of bubbles of the new phase (true vacuum) in the old
phase (false vacuum). The technique most widely used to compute the probability
of bubble nucleation is based on instanton methods in the context of the
semiclassical approximation. At zero temperature in (3+1) dimensions the
nucleation rate is dominated by the O(4) symmetric instanton, a sphere of
radius $R$, while at temperatures $T >> R^{-1}$, the decay is dominated by a
``cylindrical'' (static) instanton wtih O(3) invariance. There has been
discussion in the literature as to whether the transition between these two
regimens would be first order (discontinuity in the first derivative of the
nucleation rate at the transition temperature $T_{c}$), or second order
(continuity of the first derivative, but discontinuity of the second derivative
at $T_{c}$). In this paper we obtain the finite temperature solutions
corresponding to the quantum and the thermal regimes, and compute their action
as a function of the temperature for different values of the wall thickness in

diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of the background field theory, by which the
