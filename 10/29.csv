stabilizing unstable periodic orbits in low-dimensional dynamical systems. The
technique involves continuous feedback of signals delayed by multiples of the
orbit's period in a manner that is especially well-suited for fast systems and
optical implementation. We show how to analyze the stability of a given
implementation of ETDAS without explicit integration of time-delay equations.
To illustrate the method and point out some nontrivial features of ETDAS, we
obtain the domain of control for a period-one orbit of the driven, damped
pendulum.

energies, $J_e$ and $J_c$. This model describes localized spins at vanadium
ions in a layer of CaV$_4$O$_9$, for which a spin gap is found by a recent
experiment. Comparing the high temperature expansion of the magnetic
susceptibility to experimental data, we determined the exchange energies as
$J_e \simeq$ 610 K and $J_c \simeq$ 150 K. By the numerical diagonalization we
estimated the spin gap as $\Delta \sim 0.2J_e \simeq$ 120 K, which consists
with the experimental value 107 K. Frustration by finite $J_c$ enhances the
spin gap.

Kasteleyn in 1963. Here we extend the solution to include interactions between
neighboring dimers in two spatial lattice directions. The solution is obtained
by using the method of Bethe ansatz and by converting the dimer problem into a
five-vertex problem. The complete phase diagram is obtained and it is found
that a new frozen phase, in which the attracting dimers prevail, arises when
the interaction is attractive. For repulsive dimer interactions a new
first-order line separating two frozen phases occurs. The transitions are
continuous and the critical behavior in the disorder regime is found to be the
same as in the case of noninteracting dimers characterized by a specific heat
exponent $\a=1/2$.

functions of spin and disorder operators on the sphere and on the boundary of a
disk in the $c = 1/2$ string, both in the Ising and dual Ising matrix model
formulations. For both the Ising and dual Ising theories the results on the
sphere are in agreement with the KPZ/DDK scaling predictions based on Liouville
theory; the results on the disk agree with the scaling predictions of Martinec,
Moore, and Seiberg for boundary operators. The calculation of Ising disorder
correlations on the sphere requires the use of boundary variables introduced in
[hep-th/9510199], which have no matrix model analog. A subtlety in the
calculation on the disk arises because the expansions of the correlation
functions have leading singular terms which are nonuniversal; we show that this
issue may be resolved by using separate cosmological constants for each
boundary domain. These results give evidence that the Kramers-Wannier duality
symmetry of the $c = 1/2$ conformal field theory survives coupling to quantum
gravity, implying a duality symmetry of the $c = 1/2$ string even in the
presence of boundary operators.

nuclei has been performed in the framework of the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF)
theory using the parameter set NL-SH. Nuclear radii, isotope shifts and
deformation properties of the heavier rare-earth nuclei have been obtained,
which encompass atomic numbers ranging from Z=60 to Z=70 and include a large
range of isospin. It is shown that RMF theory is able to provide a good and
comprehensive description of the empirical binding energies of the isotopic
chains. At the same time the quadrupole deformations $\beta_{2}$ obtained in
the RMF theory are found to be in good agreement with the available empirical
values. The theory predicts a shape transition from prolate to oblate for
nuclei at neutron number N=78 in all the chains. A further addition of neutrons
up to the magic number 82 brings about the spherical shape. For nuclei above
N=82, the RMF theory predicts the well-known onset of prolate deformation at
about N=88, which saturates at about N=102. The deformation properties display
an identical behaviour for all the nuclear chains. A good description of the
above deformation transitions in the RMF theory in all the isotopic chains
leads to a successful reproduction of the anomalous behaviour of the empirical
isotopic shifts of the rare-earth nuclei. The RMF theory exhibits a remarkable
success in providing a unified and microscopic description of various empirical
data.
