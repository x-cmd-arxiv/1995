by Lagrangian perturbation approximations up to the third order. The
first--order approximation is equivalent to the ``Zel'dovich approximation''
for the type of initial data analyzed. The study is performed for two simple
models which allow studying of typical features of the clustering process in
the early non--linear regime. We calculate the initial perturbation potentials
as solutions of Poisson equations algebraically, and automate this calculation
for a given initial random density field. The presented models may also be
useful for other questions addressed to Lagrangian perturbation solutions and
for the comparison of different approximation schemes. In an accompanying paper
we investigate a detailed comparison with various N--body integrators using
these models (Karakatsanis \& Buchert 1995). Results of the present paper
include the following: 1. The collapse is accelerated significantly by the
higher--order corrections confirming previous results by Moutarde \etal (1991);
2. the spatial structure of the density patterns predicted by the ``Zel'dovich
approximation'' differs much from those predicted by the second-- and
third--order Lagrangian approximations; 3. Second--order effects amount to
internal substructures such as ``second generation'' --pancakes, --filaments
and --clusters, as are also observed in N--body simulations; 4. The
third--order effect gives rise to substructuring of the secondary mass--shells.
The hierarchy of shell--crossing singularities that form features small
high--density clumps at the intersections of caustics which we interprete as
gravitational fragmentation.

coupled to a model for Galactic chemical evolution, neutron star and black hole
birth functions (number of neutron stars and black holes as a function of their

Type II supernovae, the models give birth functions that are bimodal with peaks
at 1.27 and 1.76 M\sun \ and average masses within those peaks of 1.28 and 1.73
M\sun. For those stars that explode as Type Ib there is a narrower spread of
remnant masses, the average being 1.32 M\sun, and less evidence for bimodality.
These values will be increased, especially in the more massive Type II
supernovae, if significant accretion continues during the initial launching of
the shock, and the number of heavier neutron stars could be depleted by black
hole formation. The principal reason for the dichotomy in remnant masses for
Type II is the difference in the presupernova structure of stars above and
below 19 M\sun, the mass separating stars that burn carbon convectively from
those that produce less carbon and burn radiatively. The Type Ib's and the
lower mass group of the Type II's compare favorably with measured neutron star
masses, and in particular to the Thorsett et al. (1993) determination of the
average neutron star mass in 17 systems; 1.35 $\pm$ 0.27 M\sun. Variations in
the exponent of a Salpeter initial mass function are shown not to affect the
locations of the two peaks in the distribution function, but do affect their
relative amplitudes. Sources of uncertainty, in particular placement of the
mass cut and sensitivity to the explosion energy, are discussed, and estimates
of the total number of neutron stars and black holes in the Galaxy are given.

differ from the standard FRW ones. We have found however a particular class of
ST theories where the expansion rate of the universe during nucleosynthesis can
be very different from that found in GR, while the present value of \omega is
high enough to ensure compatibility with solar-system experiments. In the
framework of this class of theories, right primordial abundances can be
obtained for a baryon density range much wider (2.8 \lesssim \eta_{10} \lesssim
58.7) than in GR. Consequently, the usual constraint on the baryon contribution
to the density parameter of the universe can be drastically relaxed (0.01
\lesssim \Omega_{b0} \lesssim 1.38) by considering these gravity theories. This
is the first time that a ST theory is found to be compatible both with
primordial nucleosynthesis and solar-system experiments while implying
cosmological models significantly different from the FRW ones.

ground state. At a large $J/t$ the ladder is phase separated into holes and a
Heisenberg ladder. At intermediate coupling the ground state shows hole pairing
with a modified d-wave symmetry. The excitation spectrum separates into a
limited number of quasiparticles which carry charge $+|e|$ and spin ${1\over

evolves continuously into the magnon band of the spin liquid. At low doping the

bremsstrahlung of a virtual photon during pion-pion collisions. Most
calculations of electromagnetic radiation from strong interaction processes
rely on the soft photon approximation (SPA). The conditions underlying this
approximation are generally violated when dilepton spectra are calculated in
terms of their invariant mass, so that an approach going beyond the SPA becomes
necessary. Superseding previous derivations, we derive an exact formula for the
bremsstrahlung cross section. The resulting formulation is compared to various
forms based on the SPA, the two-particle phase space approximation and
R\""uckl's formula using a relativistic One Boson Exchange (OBE) model. Within
the OBE approach, we show that approximations to the bremsstrahlung dilepton
cross sections often differ greatly from the exact result; discrepancies become
greater both with rising temperature and with invariant mass. Integrated
dilepton production rates are overestimated by R\""uckl-based approximations by
factors 1.5--8.0. The largest discrepancies occur for the reaction $\pi^+\pi^+
\to \pi^+\pi^+\ell^+\ell^-$, where such approximations overestimate the exact
rate by factors ranging from 2 to 30 for invariant masses between 10 and 500
MeV. Our findings, combined with recent estimates of the Landau-Pomeranchuk
effect, indicate that bremsstrahlung dileptons rates in ultrarelativistic heavy
ion collisions should be even more suppressed than had been thought before.

neutrino and axion radiation from supernova explosion and from hot neutron
stars. The soft behavior of the bremsstrahlung from a source described by
classical transport models is discussed and pocket correction formulas for the
in-matter radiation cross sections are suggested in terms of standard transport
coefficients. The radiation rates are also discussed within a non--equilibrium
quantum field theory (Schwinger - Kadanoff - Baym - Keldysh) formulation. A
classification of diagrams and corresponding resummation in physically
meaningful terms is proposed, which considers the finite damping width of all
source particles in matter. This way each diagram in this expansion is already
free from the infra--red divergences. Both, the correct quasi--particle and
quasi--classical limits are recovered from this subset of graphs. Explicit
results are given for dense matter in thermal equilibrium. The diagrammatic
description may suggest a formulation of a transport theory that includes the
propagation of off--shell particles in non--equilibrium dense matter.
