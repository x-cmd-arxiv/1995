(Centaurus~A) based on planetary nebulae observations (Hui~\etal 1995) are used
to build dynamical models which allow us to infer the presence of a dark matter
halo. To this end, we apply a Quadratic Programming method. Constant
mass-to-light ratio models fail to reproduce the major axis velocity dispersion
measurements at large radii: the profile of this kind of models falls off too
steeply when compared to the observations, clearly suggesting the necessity of
including a dark component in the halo. By assuming a mass-to-light ratio which
is increasing with radius, the model satisfactorily matches the observations.
The total mass for the best fit model is $\sim4\times10^{11}M_\odot$ of which
about 50\% is dark matter. However, models with different total masses and dark
halos are also consistent with the data; we estimate that the total mass of
Cen~A within 50~kpc may vary between $3\times10^{11}M_\odot$ and
$5\times10^{11}M_\odot$. The best fit model consists of 75\% of stars rotating
around the short axis $z$ and 25\% of stars rotating around the long axis $x$.
Finally, the morphology of the projected velocity field is analyzed using
Statler's classification criteria (Statler 1991). We find that the appearance
of our velocity field is compatible with a type 'Nn' or 'Nd'.

QSO line spectrum can be reproduced by simply adding together the full family

  WWW at http://fy.chalmers.se/~chen/",,"10.1086/177137","astro-95-09","astro-ph",,"  The mass of the central black hole in the active galaxy NGC 4258 (M106) has
been measured to be $M=3.6\times10^7\Msun$ (Miyoshi et al. 1995). The Eddington
luminosity corresponding to this mass is $L_E=4.5\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
By contrast the X-ray luminosity of the nucleus of NGC 4258 between $2-10$ keV
is $(4\pm 1)\times10^{40}~{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ while the optical/UV luminosity is
less than $1.5\times10^{42} ~{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. The luminosity of NGC 4258 is
therefore extremely sub-Eddington, $L\sim10^{-5}L_E$ in X-rays and
$L\sim3\times10^{-4} L_E$ even if we take the maximum optical/UV luminosity.
Assuming the usual accretion efficiency of 0.1 would imply accretion rates
orders of magnitude lower than in Seyfert galaxies and quasars. We show that
the properties of the AGN in NGC 4258 can be explained by an accretion flow in
the form of a very hot, optically-thin plasma which advects most of the
viscously generated thermal energy into the central black hole and radiates
only a small fraction of the energy. In this case the accretion rate in
Eddington units could be as high as $\sim 0.16\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the
standard viscosity parameter; and the size of the hot disk should be larger
than $\sim 10$ times the Schwarzschild radius. We compare the predictions of
this model with observations and discuss its application to other low
luminosity AGN.

the vertical hydrostatic balance to hold in perturbed states. The type of

stress tensor. Optically thick disks are found to be in general more unstable
than optically thin ones. When the thermal diffusion is present, the optically
thin disks become stable, but the optically thick disks are still unstable. The
instability of the advection-dominated disks is different from that of the
geometrically thin disks without advection. In the case of no advection, the
thermal mode behaves under no appreciable surface density change. In the case
of advection-dominated disks, however, the thermal mode occurs with no
appreciable pressure change (compared with the density change), when local
perturbations are considered. The variations of angular momentum and of surface
density associated with the perturbations lead to a thermal instability. The
astrophysical implications of this instability are briefly discussed.

This could be explained with a higher heat input or with a lower gravitational
energy (all per unit gas mass), at fixed $L_B$. The effect of the flattening of
the mass distribution is investigated with galaxy models described by the
Miyamoto-Nagai potential--density pair, to which a dark matter halo of various
shapes is added. For these models the analytical expressions of the
gravitational energy, and the stellar kinetic energy associated with various
relative amounts of random motions and rotational streaming, are derived. It is
found that rotation cannot produce a change in the flow phase of the hot gas,
independently of the galaxy shape and the presence of dark matter. The effect
of flattening instead can be substantial in reducing the binding energy of the
hot gas. Thus S0s and possibly non spherical Es are less able to retain a
significant halo of hot gas than rounder Es of the same $\lb$.

with the latter in the open case.

The parametrized form of this system is taken over from the accompanying paper.
Two different algebras ${\cal S}_{\text{can}}$ and ${\cal S}_{\text{loc}}$ of
elementary perennials are constructed. The elements of ${\cal S}_{\text{can}}$
correspond to the usual creation and annihilation operators for particle modes
of the quantum field theory, whereas those of ${\cal S}_{\text{loc}}$ are the
smeared fields. Both are shown to have the structure of a Heisenberg algebra,
and the corresponding Heisenberg groups are described. Time evolution is
constructed using transversal surfaces and time shifts in the phase space.
Important roles are played by the transversal surfaces associated with
embeddings of the Cauchy hypersurface in the space-time, and by the time shifts
that are generated by space-time isometries. The automorphisms of the algebras
generated by this particular type of time shift are calculated explicitly.

the extra exterior derivative operator on spinors defined over the discrete

operator become nilpotent when acting on the spinors. It is shown that the
generalized field strength leads to the most general, gauge-invariant
Yang-Mills-Higgs Lagrangian even if the extra exterior derivative operator is
not nilpotent, while the fermionic part remains intact. The proof is given for
a single Higgs model. The method is applied to reformulate the standard model
by putting left-handed fermion doublets on the upper sheet and right-handed
fermion singlets on the lower sheet with generation mixing among quarks being
taken into account. We also present a matrix calculus of the method without

prime-cause of origin of geometry and basic concepts of particle physics such
as the fundamental fields of quarks and leptons with the spins and various
quantum numbers, internal symmetries and so on; also basic principles of
Relativity, Quantum, Gauge and Color Confinement, which are, as it was proven,
all derivative and come into being simultaneously. The substance out of which
the geometry and particles are made is a set of new physical structures-the
goyaks involved into reciprocal linkage establishing processes. We elaborated a
new mathematical framework, which is a still wider generalization of the
familiar methods of secondary quantization with appropriate expansion over the
geometric objects. One interesting offshoot of it directly leads to the
formalism of operator manifold, which framed our discussion throughout this
paper. It yields the quantization of geometry, which differs in principle from
all earlier studies. Many of the important anticipated properties, basic
concepts and principles of particle physics are appeared quite naturally in the
framework of suggested theory. It predicts a class of possible models of
internal symmetries, which utilize the whole idea of gauge symmetry and
reproduce the known phenomenology of electromagnetic, weak and strong

mathematical foundations for our novel viewpoint. We believe that the more
