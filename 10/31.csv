space coordinates are linearly coupled, one can go to a new coordinate system
where the motion is uncoupled by means of a linear transformation. The original
coupled coordinates and the new uncoupled coordinates are related by a 6x6
matrix, R. R will be called the decoupling matrix. It will be shown that of the
36 elements of the 6x6 decoupling matrix R, only 12 elements are independent.
This may be contrasted with the results for motion in 4-dimensional phase
space, where R has 4 independent elements. A set of equations is given from
which the 12 elements of R can be computed from the one period transfer
matrix.This set of equations also allows the linear parameters for the
uncoupled coordinates to be computed from the one period transfer matrix. An
alternative procedure for computing the linear parameters and the 12
independent elements of the decoupling matrix R is also given which depends on
computing the eigenvectors of the one period transfer matrix. These results can
be used in a tracking program, where the one period transfer matrix can be
computed by multiplying the transfer matrices of all the elements in a period,
to compute the linear parameters and the elements of the decoupling matrix R.

smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is presented. In a normal SPH simulation
of the collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud, high-density regions of
gas that form protostars are represented by many particles with small
separations. These high-density regions require small time steps, limiting the
time for which the simulation can be followed. Thus, the end result of the
fragmentation can never be definitively ascertained, and comparisons between
cloud fragmentation calculations and the observed characteristics of stellar
systems cannot be made. In this paper, each high-density region is replaced by
a single, non-gaseous particle, with appropriate boundary conditions, which
contains all the mass in the region and accretes any infalling mass. This
enables the evolution of the cloud and the resulting protostars to be followed
for many orbits or until most of the original cloud mass has been accreted.

analysis as a large-scale structure descriptor to the RC3 catalog of galaxies
(de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991). This technique, which originated in the field of
fractal geometry (Mandelbrot 1983) and found many applications in non-linear
dynamics, is particularly illuminating in the study of correlations between
morphology and environment. To our knowledge the technique is being applied for
the first time to the study of galaxy morphology and evolution. The PD is the
slope of the curve representing the number of galaxies within some radius,
determined separately for each galaxy in the catalog. Thus the distributions of
PD's can be compared for subsamples based on morphological type or luminosity.
The conclusions of this analysis of RC3 are: 1) The PD elucidates the tendency
for early-type galaxies to cluster more than late-type galaxies; however, there
is considerable overlap between these populations. 2) The PD statistic does not
find a significant relationship between luminosity and clustering in RC3, but
it could be an effective diagnostic in larger 2D catalogs. 3) The majority of
galaxies in RC3 (excluding clusters) are spread out in space much like a random
distribution. A population of objects that traces the distribution of galaxies,
but avoids clusters, would have only small correlations. It is worthwhile to
pursue application of the PD to larger catalogs with a wider range of
luminosities.

star orbits on the measured velocity dispersion in dwarf spheroidal galaxies.
This paper analyses previous attempts at this calculation, and explains the
simulations which were performed with mass, period and ellipticity
distributions similar to that measured for the solar neighbourhood. The
conclusion is that with functions such as these, the contribution of binary
stars to the velocity dispersion is small. The distributions are consistent
with the percentage of binaries detected by observations, although this is
quite dependent on the measuring errors and on the number of years over which
measurements have been taken. For binaries to be making a significant
contribution to the dispersion measured in dSph galaxies, the distributions of
the orbital parameters would need to be very different from those of stars in
the solar neighbourhood. In particular more smaller period orbits with higher
mass secondaries would be required. The shape of the velocity distribution may
help to resolve this issue when more data becomes available. In general, the
scenarios producing a larger apparent dispersion have a velocity distribution
which deviates more clearly from Gaussian.

contributions from close disc particle -- star encounters being significant.
For more distant encounters with some prograde element to the motion the disc
material loses energy and angular momentum to the perturber's orbit through a
resonance feature. The magnitude of the energy transfer calculated in our
simulations is greater than that of the binding energy of material exterior to

Bayesian approach that goes beyond the standard independence prior for variable
selection is adopted, and preference for certain models is interpreted as prior
information. Priors relevant to arbitrary interactions and polynomials, dummy
variables for categorical factors, competing predictors, and restrictions on
the size of the models are developed. Since the relations developed are for
priors, they may be incorporated in any Bayesian variable selection algorithm
for any type of linear model. The application of the methods here is
illustrated via the Stochastic Search Variable Selection algorithm of George

that the vortex escapes, while for larger currents the vortex is reflected as
an antivortex at one edge and the antivortex as a vortex at the other, leading
to a stationary oscillatory state and to a non-zero time-averaged voltage. The
escape and the reflection of a vortex at the array edges are qualitatively
explained in terms of a coarse-grained model of a vortex interacting
logarithmically with its image. We also discuss the case when the free

motion. Finally, we discuss the effect of self-induced magnetic fields by
taking into account the full-range inductance matrix of the array, and find

to symmetries of a Lagrangian density and are obtained if the Lie derivative of
a Lagrangian density by a certain class of vector fields on a fiber bundle
vanishes. However, only two field models meet this property in fact. In gauge
theory of exact internal symmetries, the Lie derivative by vertical vector
fields corresponding to gauge transformations is equal to zero. The
corresponding N\""oether current is reduced to a superpotential that provides
invariance of the N\""oether conservation law under gauge transformations. In
the gravitation theory, we meet the phenomenon of ""hidden energy"". Only the
superpotential part of energy-momentum of gravity and matter is observed when
the general covariant transformations are exact. Other parts of energy-momentum
display themselves if the invariance under general covariance transformations
is broken, e.g., by a background world metric. In this case, the Lie
derivatives of Lagrangian densities by vector fields which call into play the
stress-energy-momentum tensors fail to be equal to zero in general. We base our
analysis of differential conservation laws on the canonical decomposition of
the Lie derivative of a Lagrangian density $L$ by a projectable vector field on
a bundle and with respect to different Lepagian equivalents of $L$. Different
Lepagian equivalents lead to conserved quantities which differ from each other
in superpotential terms. We have different stress-energy-momentum tensors
depending on different lifts of vector fields on a base onto a bundle.
Moreover, different solutions of the same Euler-Lagrange equations may require
different energy-momentum tensors. We show that different

non-analytic contributions to the baryon masses at orders $m_q^{3/2}$, $m_q^2

the relations that follow from $SU(N_F)$ symmetry alone, but the corrections to
the large-$N$ relations are large and have the wrong sign. Chiral
power-counting and large-$N$ consistency allow a 2-loop contribution at order
$m_q^2 \ln m_q$, and a non-trivial explicit calculation is required to show
that this contribution vanishes. At second order in the expansion, there are
eight relations that are non-trivial consequences of the $1/N$ expansion, all
of which are well satisfied within the experimental errors. The average
deviation at this order is $7 \MeV$ for the $\De I = 0$ mass differences and
$0.35 \MeV$ for the $\De I \ne 0$ mass differences, consistent with the
expectation that the error is of order $1/N^2 \sim 10\%$.
