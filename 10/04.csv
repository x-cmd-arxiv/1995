The source was detected in both SIS and GIS. A power-law spectrum ($\alpha_E =
0.6^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$) with large intrinsic absorption (N$_H = 1.3^{+2.3}_{-1.1}
\times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) best describes the spectrum. Excess column density
over the local Galactic value is required at the 99\% confidence level. This
detection suggests that, although BALQSOs are X-ray quiet, it is strong
absorption in the BAL region that makes them appear faint to low energy X-ray
experiments. The required intrinsic absorbing column density is two to three
orders of magnitude larger than earlier estimates of column densities in
BALQSOs. This implies that the BAL systems are much more highly ionized than
previously thought.

of early universe cosmology often reduce the complex system to a simple
integrable system. Inflationary models are of this kind as they focus on simple
scalar field scenarios with correspondingly simple dynamics. However, we can be
assured that the universe is crowded with many interacting fields of which the
inflaton is but one. As we describe, the nonlinear nature of these interactions
can result in a complex, chaotic evolution of the universe. Here we illustrate
how chaotic effects can arise even in basic models such as homogeneous,
isotropic universes with two scalar fields. We find inflating universes which
act as attractors in the space of initial conditions. These universes display
chaotic transients in their early evolution. The chaotic character is reflected
by the fractal border to the basin of attraction. The broader implications are
likely to be felt in the process of reheating as well as in the nature of the
cosmic background radiation.

isothermal, centrally condensed, rotating 1 M\sol protostellar cloud are
presented. A numerical algorithm involving nested subgrids is used to resolve
the region where fragmentation occurs in the central part of the protostar. A
previous calculation by Boss, which produced a hierarchical multiple system, is
evolved further, at comparable numerical resolution, and the end result is a
binary, with more than half of the mass of the original cloud, whose orbital
separation increases with time as a result of accretion of high-angular
momentum material and as a result of merging with fragments that have formed
farther out. Repeating the calculation with significantly higher resolution, we
find that a sequence of binaries can be induced by fragmentation of
circumbinary disks. The stability of the resulting multiple system is
investigated Using $n$-body calculations, which indicate that such a system
would transform on a short time scale into a more stable hierarchical
structure. The outermost and most massive binary which forms in the
high-resolution run has properties similar to that of the binary found in the
low-resolution calculation. Thus the basic outcome is shown to be independent
of the numerical spatial resolution. The high-resolution run, in addition,
leads to the formation of a system of smaller fragments, which might be
important for the understanding of the origin of close binaries with low-mass
components and of low mass single stars.

recently used to estimate the He II opacity at $z \sim 3.285$. This line of
sight contains a large void in Lyman $\alpha$ clouds, in the region used for
the He II opacity observation, and the void is thought to be caused by the
ionizing radiation from a foreground quasar (Dobrzycki and Bechtold 1991). If
this is true, then the radiation from the foreground quasar is more relevant in
the region used for the estimation of the He II opacity than the diffuse UV
background radiation. We argue that in that case the observed opacity should
not be used to put constraint on the diffuse UV background radiation. Using a
typical spectral index of quasars, we estimate that most of the observed He II
opacity must be due to Gunn-Peterson effect and suggest a H I Gunn-Peterson
test along this line of sight. We further discuss the clumpiness of the
intergalactic medium in the vicinity of Q0302-003 as suggested by observations.

additionally to disambiguated vocabulary of other languages.
  Two different, complementary approaches are explored. In one of the
approaches each entry of the dictionary is taken in turn, exploiting the
information in the entry itself. The inferential capability for disambiguating
the translation is given by Semantic Density over WordNet. In the other
approach, the bilingual dictionary was merged with WordNet, exploiting mainly
synonymy relations. Each of the approaches was used in a different dictionary.
  Both approaches attain high levels of precision on their own, showing that
disambiguating bilingual nominal entries, and therefore linking bilingual

interest in parallel computing seems to be thinning out. Why use a complicated
system of parallel processors, if the problem can be solved by a single
powerful micro-chip? It is a general law, however, that exponential growth will
always end by some kind of a saturation, and then parallelism will again become
a hot topic. We try to prepare ourselves for this eventuality. The MPPC project
started in 1990 in the heydeys of parallelism and produced four ASTRA machines
(presented at CHEP'92) with 4k processors (which are expandable to 16k) based
on `yesterday's chip-technology' (chip presented at CHEP'91). These machines
now provide excellent test-beds for algorithmic developments in a complete,
real environment. We are developing for example fast-pattern recognition
algorithms which could be used in high-energy physics experiments at the LHC
(planned to be operational after 2004 at CERN) for triggering and data
reduction. The basic feature of our ASP (Associative String Processor) approach
is to use extremely simple (thus very cheap) processor elements but in huge
quantities (up to millions of processors) connected together by a very simple
string-like communication chain. In this paper we present powerful algorithms
based on this architecture indicating the performance perspectives if the
hardware (i.e. chip fabrication) quality reaches `present or even future
technology levels'.

quenched results to extract the strong coupling constant $\alpha_P^{(n_f)}$ for
the physical number of light dynamical quarks, $n_f = 3$. Good agreement is
found with calculations based on the Upsilon system. We show that a discrepancy
in $\alpha_P^{(n_f=0)}$, found between the Upsilon and Charmonium systems in
the quenched theory, disappears upon extrapolating to the physical number of
flavors. Results for the strong coupling constant $\alpha_{\overline{MS}}$ are
presented and sources of systematic error investigated.

prove that the `spirit' of the theorem is not violated, in the sense that there
exist instabilities, in both the sphaleron and gravitational sectors. The
instability analysis of the sphaleron sector, which was expected to be unstable
for topological reasons, is performed by means of a variational method. As
shown, there exist modes in this sector that are unstable against linear
perturbations. Instabilities exist also in the gravitational sector. A method
for counting the gravitational unstable modes, which utilizes a
catastrophe-theoretic approach is presented. The r\^ole of the catastrophe
functional is played by the mass functional of the black hole. The Higgs vacuum
expectation value (v.e.v.) is used as a control parameter, having a critical
value beyond which instabilities are turned on. The (stable) Schwarzschild
solution is then understood from this point of view. The catastrophe-theory
appproach facilitates enormously a universal stability study of non-Abelian
black holes, which goes beyond linearized perturbations. Some elementary

representations is presented.It extends a previous analysis of the single-mode
oscillator algebras.The expansion of the $a_ia_j^{\dagger}$ operators is
extended to include all normally ordered terms in creation and annihilation
operators and we analyze their action on Fock-like states.We restrict ourselves
to the algebras compatible with number operators. The connection between these
algebras and generalized statistics is analyzed.We demonstrate our approach by
considering the algebras obtainable from the generalized Jordan-Wigner
transformation, the para-Bose and para-Fermi algebras, the Govorkov
""paraquantization"" algebra and generalized quon algebra.
