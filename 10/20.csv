self-consistent way the amount of dark matter present in the halo. Assuming
that the dark matter is in form of MACHOs, we find for each model the expected
number of microlensing events and their average time duration for an experiment
monitoring stars in the LMC. The main effect of including anisotropy is to
reduce the microlensing rate by about 30% and to increase, but only slightly,
the mean event duration as compared to the standard halo model. Consideration
of different luminous models for the visible part of the galaxy also induce
variations in the microlensing results by roughly the same amount as mentioned
above. The main uncertainty, in order to be able to discriminate between
different dark matter distributions and to estimate the fraction of it in form
of MACHOs is due to the poor knowledge of the rotation velocity at large
galactocentric distances.

distribution comprises 287 G dwarfs within 25 pc from the Sun, and differs
considerably from the classic solar neighbourhood distribution of Pagel &
Patchett and Pagel by having a prominent single peak around [Fe/H] = -0.20 dex.
The raw data are corrected for observational errors and cosmic scatter assuming
a deviation of 0.1. In order to obtain the true abundance distribution, we use
the correction factors given by Sommer-Larsen, which take into account the
stellar scale heights. The distribution confirms the G dwarf problem, that is,
the paucity of metal-poor stars relative to the predictions of the simple model
of chemical evolution. Another feature of this distribution, which was already
apparent in previous ones, is the small number of metal-rich stars again in
comparison with the simple model. Our results indicate that it is very
difficult to fit the simple model to this distribution, even with the
definition of an `effective yield'. A comparison with several models from the
literature is made. We find that models with infall are the most appropriate to
explain the new metallicity distribution. We also show that the metallicity
distribution is compatible with a major era of star formation occurring 5 to 8
Gyr ago, similar to results found by several authors.

pathway which could lead rather naturally to low-mass X-ray binaries; whereas
binary pathways often appear rather contrived. We also discuss some dynamical

the up quark and the down quark mass matrices are generated simultaneously
their texture is formaquivalent and contains only two zeros. Textures with more
zeros (and thus more predictability) emerge if the up and down sectors are
generated stepwise. This last possibility leads to rather anomalous neutrino
patterns with mass degenerate neutrinos and large $\nu_{\mu} - \nu_{\tau}$ or
$\nu_e - \nu_{\tau}$ mixing even in the absence of hierarchy in $M_R$, the mass
matrix of the righthanded neutrinos, and as required by the LSND results if
they were to be confirmed by future experiments. In contrast if the quark mass
matrices have two zero entries (or less) the neutrino mass-mixing spectrum is
independent of the texture structure of $M_R$ -if the latter does not contain
any hierarchy of scales- and obeys the quadratic seesaw.

ultraviolet and/or infrared, have been discussed in the context of string
theory and quantum gravity. Such corrections lead to small but finite minimal
uncertainties in position and/or momentum measurements. It has been shown that
these effects could indeed provide natural cutoffs in quantum field theory. The
corresponding underlying quantum theoretical framework includes small
`noncommutative geometric' corrections to the canonical commutation relations.
In order to study the full implications on the concept of locality it is
crucial to find the physical states of then maximal localisation. These states
and their properties have been calculated for the case with minimal
uncertainties in positions only. Here we extend this treatment, though still in
one dimension, to the general situation with minimal uncertainties both in
positions and in momenta.

``preheating'' after inflation is studied. It is shown that symmetry
restoration is very efficient when the majority of created particles are
concentrated at energies much smaller than the temperature $T$ in equilibrium.
The strength of symmetry restoration measured in terms of the equivalent
temperature can exceed $T$ by many orders of magnitude. In some models the
effect can be equivalent to that if the temperature of instant reheating would
be close to the Planck scale. This can have an important impact on GUT and
axion models.

without boundary are studied. We find two classes of decompositions of a
Riemannian metric, namely, h- and g-decomposition, that help to formulate a
gravitational theory which is area preserving diffeomorphism (SDiff$M$-)
invariant but not necessarily diffeomorphism invariant. The general covariance
of equations of motion of such a theory can be achieved by incorporating proper
Weyl rescaling. The h-decomposition makes the conformal factor of a metric
SDiff$M$-invariant and the rest of the metric invariant under conformal
diffeomorphisms, whilst the g-decomposition makes the conformal factor a
SDiff$M$ scalar and the rest a SDiff$M$ tensor. Using these, we reformulate
Liouville gravity in SDiff$M$ invariant way. In this context we also further
clarify the dual formulation of Liouville gravity introduced by the author
before, in which the affine spin connection is dual to the Liouville field.

general mechanism of singularity formation in this system.
