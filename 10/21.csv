punctuations, or avalanches, rather than following a smooth, gradual path. A
comprehensive theory of avalanche dynamics in models of growth, interface
depinning, and evolution is presented. Specifically, we include the Bak-Sneppen
evolution model, the Sneppen interface depinning model, the Zaitsev flux creep
model, invasion percolation, and several other depinning models into a unified
treatment encompassing a large class of far from equilibrium processes. The
formation of fractal structures, the appearance of $1/f$ noise, diffusion with
anomalous Hurst exponents, Levy flights, and punctuated equilibria can all be
related to the same underlying avalanche dynamics. This dynamics can be
represented as a fractal in $d$ spatial plus one temporal dimension. We develop
a scaling theory that relates many of the critical exponents in this broad
category of extremal models, representing different universality classes, to
two basic exponents characterizing the fractal attractor. The exact equations
and the derived set of scaling relations are consistent with numerical
simulations of the above mentioned models.

distributions of various quantities such as peak flux or duration. We show that
for astrophysical transients such as bursts, multiple selection thresholds can
lead to various forms of data truncation, which can strongly affect the
distributions obtained from the data if not accounted for properly. Thus the
data should be considered to form a multivariate distribution. We also caution
that if the variables forming the multivariate distribution are not
statistically independent of each other, further biases can result. A general
method is described to properly account for these effects, and as a specific
example we extract the distributions of flux and duration from the BATSE 3B
Gamma-Ray Burst data. It is shown that properly accounting for the
aforementioned biases tends to increase the slope of the $\log{N}$-$\log{S}$
relation at low values of $S$, and dramatically increases the number of short

about 1.8, with a median value of 149 kpc/h [$(\Omega_0, \Lambda_0) =(1,0)$].
The baryonic mass of such large clouds is comparable to that of dwarf irregular
galaxies. Their cosmic overdensity is close to the turn-around density but
generally below the virialization density, suggesting a population of gravi-
tationally bound but unvirialized protogalactic objects at z about 2. Their
comoving volume density is similar to that of the faint blue galaxies (FBGs) at
the limiting magnitude B of 26-27. The dynamical collapsing timescale of over-
densities like these clouds is also comparable with the cosmic time difference
between z of 2 to 1. Both populations of objects show similar weak clustering
in space. All this evidence suggests a possible identification of Ly alpha
clouds as the collapsing progenitors of the FBGs at z about 1. We also
investigate the other QSO pairs: Q0307-1931/1932, Q0107-0232/0235, and the

very helpful. On $\bkastg$, a constant behavior of $T_2$ appears disfavored

Improved data is badly needed to settle this important issue firmly, especially
in view of its ramification for extractions of $V_{td}$ from $B\to\rho\gamma$.
On $B_K$, the preliminary result from JLQCD appears to contradict Sharpe \etal\
JLQCD data seems to fit very well to linear $a$ dependence and leads to an
appreciably lower value of $B_K$. Four studies of $B_K$ in the ``full''

calculation is carried out by abelianization, which leads to correlators that
are topological. They are nontrivial as a result of the topological
obstructions to the abelianization. It is shown in the large N limit on the
sphere that the correlators undergo second order phase transitions at the
critical point. Our results are applied to a computation of contractible Wilson
loops.

two-dimensional QCD on Riemann surfaces by studying the large $N$ limit of
these correlation functions on the sphere for gauge group $U(N)$. Our results
allow us to exhibit an explicit master field for the field strength
$F_{\mu\nu}$ in a ``topological gauge'', given by a single master matrix in the
Lie algebra of the maximal torus of the gauge group. Field correlators are
obtained from traces of products of the master field. We also obtain a master
field for the gauge potential $A_{\mu}$ on the sphere, consistent with the
master field for the field strength.

In particular we show that the thermodynamical entropy defined by the response
of the free energy of a black hole to the change of temperature does not
coincide with the statistical-mechanical entropy, obtained by counting its
dynamical degrees of freedom. The no-boundary wavefunction of a black hole, its
relation to the entropy problem and its generalization are discussed. We
discuss the relation between on-shell and off-shell calculations of the
entropy, and the role of the renormalization of the gravitational constant.

Many of the features present in the case of the quantum sphere can be extended.
The differential and integral calculus is studied and $CP_q(N)$ appears as a
quantum K\""{a}hler manifold. The braiding of several copies of $CP_q(N)$ is
introduced and the anharmonic ratios of four collinear points are shown to be
invariant under quantum projective transformations. They provide the building
blocks of all projective invariants. The Poisson limit is also described.

model for such an environment, which is sufficiently realistic to encompass
essentially all of linear physical optics. Applying the ``predictability
sieve'' to the quantum field, and introducing the concept of a ``quantum
halo'', we recover the familiar dichotomy between background field
configurations and photon excitations around them. We are then able to explain
why a typical linear environment for the electromagnetic field will effectively
render the former classically distinct, but leave the latter fully quantum
mechanical. Finally, we suggest how and why quantum matter fields should suffer
a very different form of decoherence.
