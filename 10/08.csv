been susceptible of direct attack. It has been known for some time that the
excessive number of blue galaxies counted at faint magnitudes implies that a
considerable fraction of the massive star formation in the universe occurred at
z < 3, but, surprisingly, spectroscopic studies of galaxies down to a B
magnitude of 24 found little sign of the expected high-z progenitors of current
massive galaxies, but rather, in large part, small blue galaxies at modest
redshifts z \sim 0.3. This unexpected population has diverted attention from
the possibility that early massive star-forming galaxies might also be found in
the faint blue excess. From KECK spectroscopic observations deep enough to
encompass a large population of z > 1 field galaxies, we can now show directly
that in fact these forming galaxies are present in substantial numbers at B
\sim 24, and that the era from redshifts 1 to 2 was clearly a major period of
galaxy formation. These z > 1 galaxies have very unusual morphologies as seen
in deep HST WFPC2 images.

ranging in mass from 0.3 to 15 Jupiter masses. The models predict luminosity
(both reflected and emitted) as a function of age, mass, deuterium abundance
and distance from parent stars of various spectral type. We also explore the
effects of helium mass fraction, rotation rate and the presence of a rock-ice
core. The models incorporate the most accurate available equation of state for
the interior, including a new theory for the enhancement of deuterium fusion by
electron screening which is potentially important in these low mass objects.
The results of our calculations reveal the enormous sensitivity of EGP's to the
presence of the parent star, particularly for G and earlier spectral types.
They also show a strong sensitivity of the flux contrast in the mid-infrared
between parent star and EGP to the mass and age of the EGP's. We interpret our
results in terms of search strategies for ground- and space-based observatories
in place or anticipated in the near future.

radio-quiet QSOs at high redshift (z = 2), in order to compare them with those
of radio-loud objects. Six QSOs were observed in the R passband with the
auxiliary port of the 4.2m WHT of the {\it Observatorio de Roque de los
Muchachos} indir August 1994. The objects were selected to be bright (M(B) <
-28$~mag) and have bright stars in the field, which could enable us to define
the point spread function (PSF) accurately. The excellent seeing of La Palma
(<0.9 arcsec thoughout the run) allowed us to detect extensions to the nuclear
PSFs around three (one radio-loud and two radio-quiet) QSOs, out of 4 suitable
targets. The extensions are most likely due to the host galaxies of these QSOs,
with luminosities of at least 3-7% of the QSO luminosity. The most likely
values for the luminosity of the host galaxies lie in the range 6-18% of the
QSO luminosity. Our observations show that, if the extensions we have detected
are indeed galaxies, extraordinary massive and luminous galaxies are not only a
characteristic of radio-loud objects, but of QSOs as an entire class.

redshift space. Using the Zel'dovich approximation, we obtain an analytic
expression for the nonlinear redshift space power spectrum in the distant
observer limit. For a given unbiased galaxy distribution in redshift space, the
anisotropies in the power spectrum depend on the parameter $f(\Omega)\approx
\Omega^{0.6}$, where $\Omega$ is the density parameter. We quantify these
anisotropies by the ratio, $R$, of the quadrupole to monopole angular moments
of the power spectrum. In contrast to linear theory, the Zel'dovich
approximation predicts a decline in $R$ with decreasing scale. This departure
from linear theory is due to nonlinear dynamics and not a result of incoherent
random velocities. The rate of decline depends strongly on $\Omega$ and the
initial power spectrum. However, we find a {\it universal} relation between the
quantity $R/R_{lin}$ (where $R_{lin}$ the linear theory value of $R$) and the
dimensionless variable $k/k_{nl}$, where $k_{nl}$ is a wavenumber determined by
the scale of nonlinear structures. The universal relation is in good agreement
with a large N-body simulation. This universal relation greatly extends the
scales over which redshift distortions can be used as a probe of $\Omega$. A
preliminary application to the 1.2 Jy IRAS yields $\Omega\sim 0.4$ if IRAS
galaxies are unbiased.

spectrum for a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field. The presence of
spin-dependent `gyromagnetic' interaction implies breaking of supersymmetry and
possible existence (for certain values of magnetic parameters) of tachyonic
instabilities. We study in detail the simplest example of the Kaluza-Klein
Melvin model describing a superstring moving in flat but non-trivial 10-d space
containing a 3-d factor which is a `twisted' product of a 2-plane and an
internal circle. We also discuss the compact version of this model constructed
by `twisting' the product of the two groups in SU(2) x U(1) WZNW theory without
changing the local geometry (and thus the central charge). We explain how the
supersymmetry is broken by continuous `magnetic' twist parameters and comment
on possible implications for internal space compactification models.

analyze the orthogonal polynomials by comparing them with the orthogonal
polynomials with constant reflection coefficients, which were studied earlier
by Ya. L. Geronimus and N. I. Akhiezer. In particular, we show that under
certain assumptions on the rate of convergence of the reflection coefficients
the orthogonality measure will be absolutely continuous on the arc. In

characterization of compactly supported nonnegative Borel measures on the real
line whose support contains one single limit point in terms of the

a principle of truncation for the spherical shell model. Utilizing the usual
principle of energy-dictated truncation to select a valence space, and
symmetry-dictated truncation to select a collective subspace of that valence
space, we are able to reduce the full shell model space to one of manageable
dimensions with modern supercomputers, even for the heaviest nuclei. The
resulting shell model then consists of diagonalizing an effective Hamiltonian
within the restricted subspace. This theory is not confined to any symmetry
limits, and represents a full solution of the original shell model if the
appropriate effective interaction of the truncated space can be determined. As
a first step in constructing that interaction, we present an empirical
determination of its matrix elements for the collective subspace with no broken
pairs in a representative set of nuclei with $130\le A \le 250$. We demonstrate
that this effective interaction can be parameterized in terms of a few
quantities varying slowly with particle number, and is capable of describing a
broad range of low-energy observables for these nuclei. Finally we give a brief
discussion of extending these methods to include a single broken collective
pair.
