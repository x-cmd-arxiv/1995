superconformal-like transformations are similar to anti-holomorphic ones of
nonsupersymmetric complex function theory. They are dual to the ordinary
superconformal transformations subject to the Berezinian addition formula
presented, noninvertible, highly degenerated and twist parity of the tangent
space in the standard basis. They also lead to the ''mixed cocycle condition''
which can be used in building noninvertible objects analogous to super Riemann
surfaces. A new parametrization for the superconformal group is presented which
allows us to extend it to a semigroup and to unify the description of old and

  The slope of the two-point correlation function for the sample as a whole is
$\gamma=1.64\pm0.05$, very similar to the local slope, and $\gamma$ is
therefore not strongly evolving with redshift. However, the amplitude of the
correlation function decreases strongly with increasing redshift, so that at
$z\approx0.6$ it is a factor of 10 lower (for $q_0=0.5$) than for a
similarly-selected local galaxy population, on scales $0.1<r<2h^{-1}$ Mpc
($q_0=0.5$). As a whole, the CFRS data is adequately represented by
$r_0(z=0.53)=1.33 \pm 0.09 h^{-1}$Mpc for $q_0=0.5$, and $r_0(z=0.53)=1.57 \pm
0.09 h^{-1}$Mpc for $q_0=0$.
  Unless the galaxy population at high redshift is quite different from any
population seen locally, an unlikely possibility, then this implies growth of
clustering as described by the evolutionary parameter $\epsilon$ to be between
$0 < \epsilon < +2$.
  No difference in the clustering of red and blue galaxies is seen at $z \geq
0.5$, although at lower redshifts, $0.2 \leq z \leq 0.5$, blue galaxies are
somewhat less strongly correlated than the redder galaxies, as seen in local
samples. This effect could be the equivalent for field galaxies to the
Butcher-Oemler effect seen in clusters of galaxies. The cross-correlation

  We show that the disk is only marginally stable to radial perturbations - a
stability regime where weak non-axisymmetric disturbances tend to grow via the
swing amplification effect, forming a ragged, multi-armed spiral pattern
similar to that observed in Sc galaxies.
  This suggests a natural explanation for the apparent clustering of the
high-velocity emission sources into several distinct clumps, and for the
observed regularity in the distance intervals between them. The clumps of
sources appear at the intersections of the spiral arms and the radial line of
longest coherent gain path, and are thus spaced apart at the characteristic
crest-to-crest radial distance between the arms. This interpretation implies an
H_2 density and disk thickness of about 1.8x10^{10} (Q/1.6)^{-1} cm^{-3}, and
0.003(Q/1.6) pc at a radius of 0.2 pc, respectively, where the local value of

unresolved component 100 times fainter than the arc is clearly detected on the
opposite side of this galaxy. The most straightforward interpretation is that
FSC 10214+4724 is gravitationally lensed by the foreground elliptical galaxy,
with the faint component a counterimage of the IRAS source. The brightness of
the arc in the HST image is then magnified by ~100 and the intrinsic source
diameter is ~0.01"" (80 pc) at 0.25 microns rest wavelength. The bolometric
luminosity is probably amplified by a smaller factor (~30), yielding an
intrinsic luminosity ~2E13 solar luminosities. A detailed lensing model is
presented which reproduces the observed morphology and relative flux of the arc
and counterimage, and correctly predicts the position angle of the lensing
galaxy. The model also predicts reasonable values for the velocity dispersion,
mass, and mass-to-light ratio of the lensing galaxy. A redshift for the lensing

the hierarchy of fermion masses and mixing angles, including neutrinos. The
neutrino masses and mixings are determined up to a discrete ambiguity
corresponding to the representation content of the Higgs sector responsible for
the Majorana mass matrix. The solar and the atmospheric neutrino deficits as
well as the COBE data, may be explained simultaneously in specific schemes
motivated by symmetries. Using simple, analytic expressions, it is possible to
demonstrate the known effect that for small $\tan\beta$, phenomenologically
interesting neutrino masses would disturb the bottom-tau unification. This
however can be avoided in schemes with a large $\mu-\tau$ mixing in the charged
leptonic sector. On the other hand, for the large $\tan\beta$ regime, due to
the fixed point properties of the top as well as the bottom coupling (which are
described by analytic expressions, for sufficiently large couplings) no
modification to the bottom-tau unification would occur. Still, large mixing in
the $\mu$-$\tau$ sector is desirable in this case as well, in order to have a
solution to the atmospheric neutrino problem. In the same schemes, a relatively
heavy strange quark $\approx 200$ MeV is also predicted.

responsible for the fermion mass matrix. In this approach the large top quark
Yukawa coupling is generated naturally during confinement, while those of the
other quarks and leptons stem from non-renormalizable couplings at the Planck
scale and are suppressed. Below the confinement scale(s) the effective theory
is minimal supersymmetric $SU(5)$ or the supersymmetric standard model.
Particles in the $\bar 5$ representations of $SU(5)$ are fundamental while
those in the $10$ and $5$ are composite. The standard model gauge group is
weakly coupled and predictions of unification can be preserved. A hierarchy in
confinement scales helps generate a hierarchical spectrum of quark and lepton
masses and ensures the Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix is nearly diagonal. However,
the most natural outcome is that the strange quark is heavier than the charm
quark; additional structure is required to evade this conclusion. No attempt
has been made to address the issues of $SU(5)$ breaking, SUSY breaking,
doublet/triplet splitting or the $\mu$ parameter. While the models presented
here are neither elegant nor complete, they are remarkable in that they can be
analyzed without uncontrollable dynamical assumptions.

Bogomolny-bound-saturating excitations of the ground state of the heterotic

they reduce to Sen's family of extremal black hole solutions of the toroidally
compactified heterotic string. We then study the large impact parameter
scattering of two such string solutions. We develop methods which go beyond the
metric on moduli space approximation and allow us to read off the subleading
polarization dependent scattering amplitudes. We find perfect agreement with
heterotic string tree amplitude predictions for the scattering of corresponding
string states. Taken together, these results clearly identify the string states
