The construction of distribution functions for triaxial systems is a hard
problem, due to the existence of only one exact integral of motion, the energy
$E$. Even so, progress has been made by use of analytic methods for special
potentials, numerical combination of orbit densities (Schwarzschild's method),
and N-body simulations. Despite these efforts, we are a long way from
understanding -- let alone constructing -- the full variety of models needed to
interpret the photometric and kinematic data on galaxies that is now available.
Some of the main unsolved problems include the range of intrinsic shapes and
figure rotation speeds for which stable dynamical equilibria can be built, and
the dynamical role of cusps and central black holes.

the proof of the existence of one-mode and two-mode exact solutions, physically
representing nonlinear standing and travelling waves of small wavelength whose
explicit lattice representations are obtained, and which are valid also as $N

parametric perturbation mechanism leads to the establishment of chaotic in time
mode interaction channels, corresponding to the formation in phase space of
bounded stochastic layers on submanifolds. The full mode-space stability
problem of the $N/2$ zone-boundary mode is solved, showing that this mode
becomes unstable through a mechanism of the modulational Benjamin-Feir type. In
the thermodynamic limit the mode is always unstable but with instability growth
rate linearly vanishing with energy density. The physical significance of these

(5) fm/c during which time strong transverse flow is generated. The
interactions in the hadronic resonance gas are not sufficiently strong to
maintain ideal fluid expansion. While pions acquire average transverse fluid
velocities around 0.47-0.58 c, heavier particles like protons and kaons cannot
keep up with the pionic fluid, since their average velocities are smaller by
about 20 to 30 \%. Although kinetic equilibrium breaks down in the final dilute
stage of $AA$ collisions, the system resembles a thermal system at a
temperature of 130 MeV, if the free streaming of hadrons after freeze-out is
suppressed. This freeze-out temperature is consistent with estimates based on
mean free paths and expansion rates in a thermal fireball but lower than values
derived from fits to measured particle ratios and transverse momentum spectra.
The processes in RQMD to which the differences can be attributed to are the
non-ideal expansion of the hadronic matter and the absence of chemical
equilibrium at freeze-out.

distorted wave impulse approximation. The reaction allows for the study of the
production process in the nuclear medium without being obscured by the details
of nuclear transition densities. First, a pion electroproduction operator
suitable for nuclear calculations is obtained by extending the Blomqvist-Laget
photoproduction operator to the virtual photon case. The operator is gauge
invariant, unitary, reference frame independent, and describes the existing
data reasonably well. Then it is applied in nuclei to predict nuclear cross
sections under a variety of kinematic arrangements. Issues such as the effects
of gauge-fixing, the interference of the $\Delta$ resonance with the
background, sensitivities to the quadrupole component of the $\Delta$
excitation and to the electromagnetic form factors, the role of final-state
interactions, are studied in detail. Methods on how to experimentally separate
the various pieces in the coincidence cross section are suggested. Finally, the
model is compared to a recent SLAC experiment.

spectra of cuprates have been detected in the reflectivity spectra of
chemically doped parent compounds of high-critical-temperature superconductors,
both $n$-type and $p$-type. In Nd$_2$CuO$_{4-y}$ these features, whose
intensities depend both on doping and temperature, include local vibrational
modes in the far infrared and a broad band centered at $\sim$ 1000 cm$^{-1}$.
The latter band is produced by the overtones of two (or three) local modes and
is well described in terms of a small-polaron model, with a binding energy of
about 500 cm$^{-1}$. Most of the above infrared features are shown to survive
in the metallic phase of Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$Cu0$_{4-y}$, Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_6$, and
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-y}$, where they appear as extra-Drude peaks. The occurrence
of polarons is attributed to local modes strongly coupled to carriers, as shown
by a comparison with tunneling results.
