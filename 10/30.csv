by using another method which consistes in applying Lie series and
exponentiation as described by W. Groebner and for canonical systems by A.J.
Dragt. We firstly use an approximate Hamiltonian obtained by a series expansion
of the square root. Furthermore, nonlinear crossing terms due to the curvature
in bending magnets are neglected. An improved Hamiltonian, excluding solenoids,
is introduced in Appendix A by using the unexpanded square root mentioned
above, but neglecting again nonlinear crossing terms...

structure of dark matter haloes which form in scale-free models. We find that
the radius r_178 corresponding to a mean interior overdensity of 178 accurately
delineates the quasi-static halo interior from the surrounding infalling
material, in agreement with the simple spherical collapse model. The interior
velocity dispersion correlates with mass, again in good agreement with the
spherical collapse model. Interior to the virial radius r_178, the spherical
averaged density, circular velocity and velocity dispersion profiles are well
fit by a simple 2-parameter analytic model proposed by Navarro etal (1995).
This model has density going as 1/r at small radii, steepening to 1/r^3 at
large radii, and fits our haloes to the resolution limit of the simulations.
The two model parameters, scalelength and mass, are tightly correlated. Lower
mass haloes are more centrally concentrated, and so have scalelengths which are
a smaller fraction of their virial radius than those of their higher mass
counterparts. This reflects the earlier formation times of low mass haloes. The
haloes are moderately aspherical, with typical axial ratios 1:0.8:0.65 at their
virial radii. These shapes are maintained by an anisotropic velocity dispersion
tensor. The median value of the spin parameter is lambda=0.04, with a weak
trend for lower lambda at higher halo mass. We also investigate how the halo
properties depend on the algorithm used to identify them, using both
friends-of-friends and spherical overdensity methods. We find that for groups
selected at mean overdensities 100-400 by either method the properties are
insensitive to how the haloes are selected, if the halo centre is taken as the
position of the most bound particle

in Gamma Ray Bursts located in the Galactic corona, thus circumventing the
problem raised by Greisen--Zatsepin--Kuz'min cutoff. The acceleration of UHECRs
could occur in the pulsars which, in the coronal GRB model, produce them: the
same parameters that permit fitting GRBs' observations in the model of
Podsiadlowski, Rees and Ruderman (1995) lead to an estimate of the highest
achievable energies corresponding to that of the Bird et al (1994) event, and
to very low luminosities in cosmic rays. I show that, if the observations of
Milgrom and Usov (1995a) are confirmed, the extragalactic GRBs' model for the
acceleration of UHECRs is untenable, but the same constraint does not apply to
the coronal model. Also, I show that the efficiency of particle acceleration
needs be much smaller (and less demanding) than in cosmological models of GRBs.
Uncertainties remain about the ensuing cosmic ray spectral distribution. I also
briefly discuss observational strategies to distinguish between the two
possibilities.

Chern-Simons and Maxwell fields is applied to the study of anyon
superconductor. It is demonstrated, that the Meissner effect can be realized in
the case of the simultaneous presence of the fermions with a different magnetic
moment interactions. Under the certain conditions there occures an extra
plateau at the magnetization curve. In the order under consideration the
spectrum of the electromagnetic field excitations contains the long-range
interaction and one massive ""photon"" state.

brane equations of motion originates naturally in the geometric (Lund- Regge-
Omnes) approach. To study the possibility to use this zero curvature
representation for investigation of nonlinear equations of $p$-- branes, the
simplest case of $D$-- dimensional string ($p=1$) is considered. The connection
is found between the $SO(1,1)$ gauge (world--sheet Lorentz) invariance of the
string theory with a nontrivial dependence on a spectral parameter of the Lax
matrices associated with the nonlinear equations describing the embedding of a
string world sheet into flat $D$-- dimensional space -- time. Namely, the
spectral parameter can be identified with a parameter of constant $SO(1,1)$
gauge transformations, after the deformation of the Lax matrices has been
performed.

variety of physical contexts. Conventional discrete approximations, however,
cannot capture all aspects of the original manifold, notably its topology. In
this paper we discuss an approximation scheme due to Sorkin which correctly
reproduces important topological aspects of continuum physics. The
approximating topological spaces are partially ordered sets (posets), the
partial order encoding the topology. Now, the topology of a manifold $M$ can be
reconstructed from the commutative C*-algebra $\cc(M)$ of continuous functions
defined on it. In turn, this algebra is generated by continuous probability
densities in ordinary quantum physics on $M$. The latter also serve to specify
the domains of observables like the Hamiltonian. For a poset, the role of this
algebra is assumed by a noncommutative C$^*$-algebra $\ca $. This fact makes
any poset a genuine `noncommutative' (`quantum') space, in the sense that the
algebra of its `continuous functions' is a noncommutative C$^*$-algebra. We
therefore also have a remarkable connection between finite approximations to
quantum physics and noncommutative geometries. We use this connection to
develop various approximation methods for doing quantum physics using $\ca$.

suggest such an effect for the hydrogen covered Mo and W(110) surfaces. Using
density-functional theory we examine the electronic structure and the
electron-phonon coupling of these systems. Besides good agreement with the
experimental phonon frequencies our study provides a characterization and
quantitative analysis of an unusual scenario determining the electronic,
vibrational, and structural properties of these surfaces.
