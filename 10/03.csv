Originally believed to be an example of a classical colliding ring galaxy with
multiple rings, the new observations show a large disturbed neutral hydrogen
disk extending 2.7 times the radius of the bright optical ring. We also present
evidence for optical shells or ripples in the outer isophotes of the galaxy
reminiscent of the ripples seen in some early type systems. The small
elliptical originally believed to be the companion is shown to be a background
galaxy. The \ion{H}{1} disk consists of two main parts: a very irregular outer
structure, and a more regular inner disk associated with the main bright
optical ring. In both cases, the \ion{H}{1} structures do not exactly trace the
optical morphology. In the outer parts, the \ion{H}{1} distribution does not
correlate well with the optical ripples. Even the inner \ion{H}{1} disk does
not correspond well morphologically nor kinematically to the optical rings.
These peculiarities lead us to believe that the potential in which the
\ion{H}{1} disk resides is significantly out of equilibrium --- a situation
which would inherently produce rings of star formation. We suggest that Arp~10
is the result of the intermediate stage of a merger between a large \ion{H}{1}
rich disk and a gas-poor disk system. As such, it may represent an example of a
class of mergers which lies intermediate between the ``ripple and shell''
accretion systems and the head-on collisional ring galaxies.

postshock region intercepts soft photons from the Keplerian component and
reradiates them as hard X-rays and $\gamma$ rays after Comptonization. We solve
two-temperature equations in the postshock region with Coulomb energy exchange
between protons and electrons, and incorporating radiative processes such as
bremsstrahlung and Comptonization. We also present the exact prescription to
compute the reflection of the hard X-rays from the cool disk. We produce
radiated spectra from both the disk components as functions of the accretion

smoothly initiated by a single parameter, namely, the mass accretion rate of
the disk. In the soft state, when the postshock region is very optically thick
and cooled down, bulk motion of the converging flow determines the spectral
index to be about $1.5$ in agreement with observations.

spectral flow of fermion zero mode. This results in finite temperature and
entropy of the moving vortex. The tunneling transition rate between the
fermionic levels under the influence of the vortex motion suggests the
effective temperature of the vortex core $T_{\rm eff}=(2/\pi) p_Fv_L$, where
$v_L$ is the velocity of the vortex with respect to the heat bath reference
frame and $p_F$ the Fermi momentum. This is an analogue of the Unruh

double limit is taken, in which the lattice spacing associated with the fermion

field drives an oscillating electric field. The ensuing dissipation of axions
is found to be inversely proportional to the conductivity of the primordial
plasma. This counterintuitive result is essentially equivalent to ``Zeno's
paradox'' or the ``watched-pot effect'' of quantum mechanics. It implies that
the standard predictions of the cosmic axion density remain unaltered even if
primordial magnetic fields are strong.

are dominated by the $soft$ light quark vacuum condensate, these couplings are
governed by the $hard$ perturbative graph, like other heavy-to-heavy

contributions originating from the graphs involving the heavy quark part of the

collective flow observables for neutrons, which are consistent with those of
protons plus bound nucleons from the Plastic Ball Group, agree with the
