viable method to (1) study the evolution of the galaxy population in the past
and (2) determine the value of the deceleration parameter $q_0$. After a brief
description of the basic concepts needed to model the counts, we show that
simple luminosity evolution models which incorporate dust are able to provide
reasonable fits to both the deep counts and the redshift distribution of faint
field galaxies if $q_0=0.05$. In order to fit the counts in a {\it closed}
($q_0=0.5$) Universe, we include a population of fading dwarfs, more numerous
in the past, based on current ideas to understand the nature of dwarf galaxies.

investigate the interaction between the disk, halo, and satellite components of
the system during a merger. Our fiducial encounter begins with a satellite in a
prograde, circular orbit inclined thirty degrees with respect to the disk plane
at a galactocentric distance of six disk scalelengths. The satellite's mass is
10% of the disk's mass and its half-mass radius is about 1.3 kpc. The system is
modelled with 500 000 particles, sufficient to mitigate numerical relaxation
noise over the merging time. The satellite sinks in only ~1 Gyr and a core
containing ~45% of its initial mass reaches the centre of the disk. With so
much of the satellite's mass remaining intact, the disk sustains significant
damage as the satellite passes through. At the solar circle we find that the
disk thickens ~60%, the velocity dispersions increase by
$\Delta\mbox{\boldmath$\sigma$} \simeq (10,8,8)$ km/s to $(\sigma_R,
\sigma_\phi, \sigma_z) \simeq (48, 42, 38)$ km/s, and the asymmetric drift is
unchanged at ~18 km/s. Although the disk is not destroyed by these events
(hence ""minor"" mergers), its final state resembles a disk galaxy of earlier
Hubble type than its initial state, thicker and hotter, with the satellite's
core enhancing the bulge. Thus minor mergers continue to be a promising
mechanism for driving galaxy evolution.

counterrotating gas disk in a spiral galaxy. Using a hierarchical tree gravity
solver combined with a sticky-particle gas dissipation scheme for our
simulations, we have investigated three mechanisms: episodic and continuous gas
infall, and a merger with a gas-rich dwarf galaxy. We find that both episodic
and continuous gas infall work reasonably well and are able to produce a
substantial gas counterrotating disk without upsetting the stability of the
existing disk drastically, but it is very important for the gas to be
well-dispersed in phase-space and not form concentrated clumps prior to its
absorption by the disk galaxy. The initial angular momentum of the gas also
plays a crucial role in determining the scale length of the counterrotating
disk formed and the time it takes to form. The rate of infall, i.e. the mass of
gas falling in per unit time, has to be small enough to preclude excessive
heating of the preexisting disk. It is much easier in general to produce a
smaller counterrotating disk than it is to produce an extensive disk whose
scale length is similar to that of the original prograde disk.
  A gas-rich dwarf merger does not appear to be a viable mechanism to produce a
massive counterrotating disk, because only a very small dwarf galaxy can
produce a counterrotating disk without increasing the thickness of the existing
disk by an order of magnitude, and the time-scale for this process is
prohibitively long because it makes it very unlikely that several such mergers
can accumulate a massive counterrotating disk over a Hubble time.

Lyman-alpha clouds in voids: one at 3047 km/s (heliocentric) toward Mrk 421 and
a second just beyond the Local Supercluster at 2861 km/s toward I Zw 1,
confirming our earlier discovery of Lyman-alpha absorption clouds in voids

low-redshift neutral hydrogen absorption clouds toward four targets, a
frequency of approximately one absorber every 3400 km/s above 10^12.7 cm^-2
column density. Of these 10 absorption systems, 3 lie within voids; the
probable absorber also lies in a void. Thus, the tendency of Lyman-alpha
absorbers to ``avoid the voids'' is not as clear as we found previously. If the
Lyman-alpha clouds are approximated as homogeneous spheres of 100 kpc radius,
their masses are ~ 10^9 Msun (about 0.01 times that of bright L* galaxies) and
they are 40 times more numerous, comparable to the density of dwarf galaxies
and of low-mass halos in numerical CDM simulations. The Lyman-alpha clouds
contribute a fraction Omega_cl ~ 0.003 h75^-1 to the closure density of the
universe, comparable to that of luminous matter. These clouds probably require
a substantial amount of non-baryonic dark matter for gravitational binding.
They may represent extended haloes of low- mass protogalaxies which have not
experienced significant star formation or low-mass dwarf galaxies whose star
formation ceased long ago, but blew out significant gaseous material.

introduce a second screening charge, one which depends on fractional powers of

developed, and explicit general integral representations for conformal blocks
on the sphere are provided. The fusion rules are discussed and as a check it is
verified that the conformal blocks satisfy the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
