as some supergiants with infrared excess. We present photometry of the sources
and discuss the colour diagrams and bolometric luminosities. Most of the AGB
stars are luminous, often close to the classical limit of $M_{\rm bol}=-7.1$.
  To determine whether the stars are oxygen-rich or carbon-rich, we have
acquired narrow-band mid-infrared photometry with the ESO TIMMI camera for
several sources. All but one are found to show the silicate feature and
therefore to have oxygen-rich dust: the colours of the remaining source are
consistent with either an oxygen-rich or a carbon-rich nature. A method to
distinguish carbon and oxygen stars based on H$-$K versus K$-$[12] colours is
presented.
  We discuss several methods of calculating the mass-loss rate: for the AGB
stars the mass-loss rates vary between approximately 5 times 10**-4 and 5 times
10**-6 solar masses per year, depending on assumed dust-to-gas mass ratio. We
present a new way to calculate mass-loss rates from the OH-maser emission. We
find no evidence for a correlation of the mass-loss rates with luminosity in
these obscured stars. Neither do the mass-loss rates for the LMC and SMC stars
differ in any clear systematic way from each other. Expansion velocities appear
to be slightly lower in the LMC than in the Galaxy.
  Period determinations are discussed for two sources: the periods are
comparable to those of the longer-period galactic OH/IR stars. All of the
luminous stars for which periods are available, have significantly higher
luminosities than predicted from the period--luminosity relations.

  figures available upon request. To appear in ""Physics Report""",,,,"cond-mat",,"  We present a comprehensive investigation of nonequilibrium effects and self
heating in single electron transfer devices based primarily on the Coulomb
blockade effect. During an electron trapping process, a hot electron may be
deposited in a quantum dot or metal island, with an extra energy usually on the
order of the Coulomb charging energy, which is much higher than the temperature
in typical experiments. The hot electron may relax through three channels:
tunneling back and forth to the feeding lead (or island), emitting phonons, and
exciting background electrons. Depending on the magnitudes of the rates in the
latter two channels relative to the device operation frequency and to each
other, the system may be in one of three different regimes: equilibrium,
non-equilibrium, and self heating (partial equilibrium). In the quilibrium
regime, a hot electron fully gives up its energy to phonons within a pump
cycle. In the nonequilibrium regime, the relaxation is via tunneling with a
distribution of characteristic rates; the approach to equilibrium goes like a
power law of time (frequency) instead of an exponential. This channel is
plagued completely in the continuum limit of the single electron levels. In the
self heating regime, the hot electron thermalizes quickly with background
electrons, whose temperature $T_e$ is elevated above the lattice temperature
$T_l$. We have calculated the coefficient in the well known $T^5$ law of energy
dissipation rate, and compared the results to experimental values for aluminum
and copper islands and for a two dimensional semiconductor quantum dot.
Moreover, we have obtained different scaling relations between the electron
temperature and operation frequency and device size for various types of
devices.

Standard Model. We then elucidate the assumptions underlying the Minimal
Supersymmetric Model as well as the more restrictive minimal supergravity GUT
model with the radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry. These models serve
to guide our thinking about the implications of supersymmetry for experiments.
To facilitate our study of signatures of supersymmetric particles at high
energy colliders, we describe the decay patterns of sparticles as well as their
production mechanisms in $e^+e^-$ and hadron-hadron collisions. We then discuss
how sparticles may be searched for in on-going experiments at the Tevatron and
at LEP. We review phenomenological constraints on supersymmetric particle
masses from non-observation of any signals in these experiments, and also
briefly discuss constraints from low energy experiments and from cosmology.
Next, we study new strategies by which supersymmetric particles may be searched
for at supercolliders, and also what we can learn about their properties
(masses, spins, couplings) in these experiments. A determination of sparticle
properties, we will see, may provide us with clues about the nature of physics
at the ultra-high scale. After a brief discussion of possible extensions of the
minimal framework and the implications for phenomenology, we conclude with our
outlook for the future.

that for a large class of three-step nilmanifolds, if a pair of nilmanifolds in

Laplace spectrum on functions. In contrast, we present the first example of a
pair of isospectral Riemannian manifolds with the same marked length spectrum

Zoll spheres, which are not even isospectral, this is the only example of a
pair of Riemannian manifolds with the same marked length spectrum, but not the

equivalent to a random-phase-approximation equation; as such, it can develop
imaginary eigenvalues. Thus, our study can not be complete without first
discussing the stability of Salpeter's equation. The stability analysis limits
the form of the kernel and reveals that, contrary to the usual assumption, the
confining component can not transform as a Lorentz scalar; it must transform as
the timelike component of a vector. Moreover, the stability analysis sets an
upper limit on the size of the one-gluon-exchange component; the value for the
critical coupling is determined through a solution of the ``semirelativistic''
Coulomb problem. These limits place important constraints on the interaction
and suggest that a more sophisticated model is needed to describe the light and
