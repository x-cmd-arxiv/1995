the Seyfert 1 galaxy IC 4329A are presented. We find that the 0.4 - 10 keV
spectrum of IC 4329A is best described by the sum of a steep ($\Gamma \sim
1.98$) power-law spectrum passing through a warm absorber plus a strong
reflection component and associated Fe K line, confirming recent results
(Madejski et al. 1995, Mushotsky et al. 1995). Further cold absorption in
excess of the Galactic value and covering the entire source is also required by
the data, consistent with the edge-on galactic disk and previous X-ray
measurements. The effect of the warm absorber at soft X-ray energies is best
parameterized by two absorption edges, one consistent with OVI, OVII or NVII,
the other consistent with OVIII. A description of the soft excess in terms of
blackbody emission, as observed in some other Seyfert 1 galaxies, is ruled out
by the data. A large amount of reflection is detected in both the GIS and SIS
detectors, at similar intensities. We find a strong correlation between the
amount of reflection and the photon index, but argue that the best solution
with the present data is that given by the best statistical fit. The model
dependence of the Fe K line parameters is also discussed. Our best fit gives a
slightly broad ($\sigma \simeq 0.11 \pm 0.08$ keV) and redshifted (E $\simeq
6.20 \pm 0.07$ keV) Fe K line, with equivalent width $\simeq$ 89 $\pm$ 33 eV.
The presence of a weak Fe K line with a strong reflection can be reconciled if
one assumes iron underabundances or ionized reflection. We also have modeled
the line with a theoretical line profile produced by an accretion disk. This
yields results in better agreement with the constraints obtained from the
reflection component.

recently introduced to explain peculiar features of tunneling in certain
two-dimensional systems. This mechanism is known as chaos-assisted tunneling.
We study its consequences for the distribution of the level splittings and
obtain a general analytical form for this distribution under the assumption
that chaos assisted tunneling is the only operative mechanism. %The validity of
this form can then in %principle be checked either numerically or even
experimentally. We have checked that the analytical form we obtain agrees with
splitting distributions calculated numerically for a model system in which
chaos-assisted tunneling is known to be the dominant mechanism. The
distribution depends on two parameters: The first gives the scale of the
splittings and is related to the magnitude of the classically forbidden
processes, the second gives a measure of the efficiency of possible barriers to
classical transport which may exist in the chaotic region. If these are weak,
this latter parameter is irrelevant; otherwise it sets an energy scale at which
the splitting distribution crosses over from one type of behavior to another.
The detailed form of the crossover is also obtained and found to be in good
agreement with numerical results for models for chaos-assisted tunneling.

coverages are compared with the predictions of a two-component lattice-gas

lateral interactions out to fourth-nearest neighbors. Using group-theoretical
ground-state calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate effective
electrovalences and lateral adsorbate--adsorbate interactions so as to obtain
overall agreement with experiments, including both our own and those of other

of 2/3 monolayer Cu and 1/3 monolayer sulfate at intermediate electrode

theory with unbroken N=1 supersymmetry must contain a Higgs hypermultiplet and
a vector multiplet. When the multiplets parametrize the quaternionic manifold

vanishing vacuum energy with a sliding massive spin 3/2 multiplet is obtained.
Potential applications to N=2 low energy effective actions of superstrings are

over $A$ are introduced and studied as objects with both module and comodule
structures satisfying a compatibility condition. The category $\DY{\cal C}^A_A$
of crossed modules is braided and is a concrete realization of a known general
construction of a double or center of a monoidal category. For a quantum
braided group $(A,\overline A,{\cal R})$ the corresponding braided category of
modules ${\cal C}_{\cO{A,\overline A}}$ is identified with a full subcategory
in $\DY{\cal C}_A^A$. The connection with cross products is discussed and a
suitable cross product in the class of quantum braided groups is built.
Majid--Radford theorem, which gives equivalent conditions for an ordinary Hopf
algebra to be such a cross product, is generalized to the braided category.
Majid's bosonization theorem is also generalized.
