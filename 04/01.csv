surface density of faint blue galaxies at high redshift, selected by their low
surface brightness, are unique tools for mapping the projected mass
distribution of foreground mass concentrations. The systematic gravitational
lens distortions of $10^4$ of these background galaxies in 15\arcmin\ fields
reveal detailed mass profiles for intervening clusters of galaxies, and are a
direct measure of the growth of mass inhomogeneity. The mass is measured
directly, avoiding uncertainties encountered in velocity or X-ray derived mass
estimates.
  Mass in the rich cluster Abell 1689 follows smoothed light, outside 100
h$^{-1}$ kpc, with a rest-frame V band mass-to-light ratio of $400 \pm 60$
$h^{-1} (M/L_V)_\odot$. Near the cluster center, mass appears to be more
smoothly distributed than light. Out to a radius of 1 $h^{-1}$ Mpc the total
mass follows a steeper than isothermal profile. Comparing with preliminary high
resolution N-body clustering simulations for various cosmogonies on these
scales, these data are incompatible with hot dark matter, a poor fit to most
mixed dark matter models, and favor open or $\Lambda > 0$ cold dark matter.
Substructure is seen in both the mass and the light, but detailed
correspondence is erased on scales less than 100 $h^{-1}$ kpc.

combining training examples with a coarse domain theory to produce a more

theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for
the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the
original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more
accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky,
cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a
coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that
produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for
accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required.
Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible
representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision
systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and
weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the
underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided
constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over
previous theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior,
limitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction.

the same {\bf{10}} representation of SO(10) implying the unification not only

predict large values of $\tan\beta \sim 50$. In this paper we study the effects
of departing from the minimal conditions in order to see if we can find models
with a reduced value of $\tan\beta$. In order to maintain predictability,
however, we try to do this with the addition of only one new parameter. We
still assume that the fermion masses arise from interactions of the spinor
representations with a single ${\bf 10}$ representation, but this ${\bf 10}$
now only contains a part of the two light Higgs doublets. This enables us to
introduce one new parameter $\omega=\lambda_b/\lambda_t$. For values of $\omega
\ll 1$ we can in principle reduce the value of $\tan\beta$. In fact, $\omega$
is an overall factor which multiplies the down quark and charged lepton Yukawa
matrices. Thus the theory is still highly constrained. We show that the first
generation quark masses and the CP-violation parameter $\epsilon_K$ yield
strong constraints on the phenomenologically allowed models. In the end, we
find that large values of $\tan\beta$ are still preferred.

to a single fundamental domain of the super-modular group in the super-Schottky

obtained for arbitrary N and are shown to be consistent with exact results
recently obtained for special type II string amplitudes for orbifold or

imply the validity of superstring perturbation theory in the weak-coupling
limit, might be used to determine scattering amplitudes at strong coupling
because of the S-duality of type II and heterotic string theories.
Non-perturbative effects are consistent with these estimates, based on a sum
over closed surfaces, because they can be derived from an additional

evolution equation for the time dependent density matrix is derived. The time
evolution is evaluated explicitly near the barrier top in the temperature
region where quantum effects become important. It is shown that there exists a
quasi-stationary state with a constant flux across the potential barrier. This
state generalizes the Kramers flux solution of the classical Fokker-Planck
equation to the quantum regime. In the temperature range explored the quantum
flux state depends only on the parabolic approximation of the anharmonic
barrier potential near the top. The parameter range within which the solution
is valid is investigated in detail. In particular, by matching the flux state
onto the equilibrium state on one side of the barrier we gain a condition on
the minimal damping strength. For very high temperatures this condition reduces
to a known result from classical rate theory. Within the specified parameter
range the decay rate out of a metastable state is calculated from the flux
solution. The rate is shown to coincide with the result of purely thermodynamic
methods. The real time approach presented can be extended to lower temperatures
