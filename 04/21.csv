Southern Sky Redshift Survey (SSRS2) to estimate the pairwise velocity
dispersion of galaxies $\sig12$ on a scale of $\sim 1 \hmpc$. Both surveys are
complete to an apparent magnitude limit $B(0)=15.5$. Our sample includes 12,812
galaxies distributed in a volume $1.8 \times 10^6 \hmpc3$. We conclude: 1) The
pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the combined CfA2+SSRS2 redshift
survey is $\sig12=540 \kms \pm 180 \kms$. Both the estimate and the variance of
$\sig12$ significantly exceed the canonical values $\sig12=340 \pm40$ measured
by Davis \& Peebles (1983) using CfA1. 2) We derive the uncertainty in $\sig12$
from the variation among subsamples with volumes on the order of $7 \times
10^5$ \hmpc3. This variation is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the
formal error, 36 $\kms$, derived using least-squares fits to the CfA2+SSRS2
correlation function. This variation among samples is consistent with the
conclusions of Mo \etal (1993) for a number of smaller surveys and with the
analysis of CfA1 by Zurek \etal (1994). 3) When we remove Abell clusters with
$R\ge1$ from our sample, the pairwise velocity dispersion of the remaining
galaxies drops to $295 \pm 99 \kms$. Thus the dominant source of variance in
$\sig12$ is the shot noise contributed by dense virialized systems. 4) The
distribution of pairwise velocities is consistent with an isotropic exponential
with velocity dispersion independent of scale.

(QPOs) observed recently in the Rapid Burster MXB 1730-335 and in some black
hole candidates sources (Cyg X--1 and GRO~J0422+32). We consider
$\alpha$-viscosity models in which the viscous stress is proportional to the
total pressure. In contrast to previous time dependent studies it is assumed
that all mass accretion and angular momentum transport take place in an
optically thick disk, but that a fraction of the gravitational energy that is
released is dissipated in a corona. It is found that the coronal energy
dissipation can effectively reduce the amplitudes of the mass flow variations
generated from the thermal and viscous instabilities (in comparison to models
without a corona) to a state in which the disk exhibits mild oscillatory
nonsteady behavior. These oscillations are globally coherent in the unstable
regions of the disk. A model for the high and low states of black hole
candidate systems is also proposed. It is suggested that the low state, which
is characterized by a hard X-ray spectrum, corresponds to a disk configuration
in which the inner disk is in an advection dominated hot optically thin state
whereas the high state corresponds to a configuration in which the inner disk
is in an optically thick state surrounded by a corona. In this model, the mass
accretion rate in the system is higher in the low state than in the high state.
The hard X-ray spectrum of QPOs observed in the low state can be naturally
explained by such a model.

effects of dilution on optimal undirected self-avoiding paths in a random

directed paths in undiluted medium, as long as forbidden bonds are not
exceeding the percolation threshold. Thus, overhanging configurations do not
alter the standard self-affine directed polymer scaling regime, even above the
directed threshold, when they become unavoidable. When dilution reaches the
undirected threshold, the optimal path becomes fractal, with fractal dimension
equal to $D_{\rm min}$, the dimension of the minimal length path on percolation
cluster backbone. In this regime the optimal path energy fluctuation,
$\overline{\Delta E}$, can be ascribed entirely to minimal length fluctuations,
and satisfies $\overline{\Delta E} \propto L^{\omega}$, with $\omega=1.02 \pm
0.06$ in $2d$, $L$ being the Euclidean distance. Hierarchical lattice
calculations confirm that $\omega$ is also the exponent of the leading scaling
correction to $\overline E \propto L^{D_{\rm min}}$.
  Upon approaching threshold, the probability, ${\cal R}$, that the optimal
path does not stick entirely on the minimal length one, obeys ${\cal R} \sim
\left( \Delta p\right) ^{\rho}$, with $\rho \sim 1.0 \pm 0.05$ on hierarchical
lattices. Such behaviour could be characteristic of the crossover to fractal

sticking does not occur for directed paths at the directed percolation
threshold.

asymptotic ``size'' of the black hole, provided the spacetime is globally
hyperbolic and satisfies the dominant-energy and non-negative-pressures
conditions. Second, for spacetimes with ${\Bbb R}^3$ Cauchy surfaces (or an
appropriate generalization thereof) and satisfying the dominant energy and
non-negative-pressures conditions, we conjecture that the length of a journey
anywhere within a black hole is again bounded, although here the bound requires
a knowledge of the initial data for the gravitational field on a Cauchy
surface. We prove these conjectures in the spherically symmetric case. We also
prove that there is an upper bound on the lifetimes of observers lying ``deep
within'' a black hole, provided the spacetime satisfies the
timelike-convergence condition and possesses a maximal Cauchy surface. Further,
we investigate whether one can increase the lifetime of an observer that has
entered a black hole, e.g., by throwing additional matter into the hole.
Lastly, in an appendix, we prove that the surface area $A$ of the event horizon
of a black hole in a spherically symmetric spacetime with ADM mass
$M_{\text{ADM}}$ is always bounded by $A \le 16\pi M_{\text{ADM}}^2$, provided

the model reproduces the general features of the experimental data, three
aspects of the parameters needed are worth noting. The elastic scattering rate
required to fit the data is much smaller than measured from the normal state,
the scattering phase shifts have to be close to pi/2 and a strong coupling
value of the gap parameter 2\Delta(0)/kTc = 6 is needed. On the experimental

Rs,res(0) further complicate a quantitative comparison.
