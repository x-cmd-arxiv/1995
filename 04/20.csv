forest in QSO spectra. Recent observations of the size and velocity of Ly-alpha
forest clouds have indicated that the Ly-alpha absorption is probably not given
by collapsed objects, but pre-collapsed regions in the baryonic density field.
Therefore, a linear approximation description would be able to provide valuable
information. We developed a technique to simulate Ly-alpha forest as the
absorption of such pre-collapsed regions under linear approximation regime. The
simulated Ly-alpha forests in models of the standard cold dark matter (SCDM),
the cold plus hot dark matter (CHDM), and the low-density flat cold dark matter
(LCDM) have been confronted with observational features, including 1) the
number density of Ly-alpha lines and its dependencies on redshift and
equivalent width; 2) the distribution of equivalent widths and its redshift
dependence; 3) clustering; and 4) the Gunn-Peterson effect. The ""standard"" CHDM
model, i.e. 60% cold and 30% hot dark matters and 10\% baryons, is found to be
difficult to pass the Ly-alpha forest test, probably because it produces
structures too late and favors to form structures on large scales instead of
small scale objects like Ly-alpha clouds. Within a reasonable range of J_nu,
the UV background radiation at high redshift, and delta_th, the threshold of
the onset of gravitational collapse of the baryonic matter, the LCDM model is
consistent with observational data in all above-mentioned four aspects. The
model of SCDM can also fit with observation, but it requires a smaller J_nu and
a higher delta_th. This suggests that whether a significant part of the
Ly-alpha forest lines is located in the halos of collapsed objects would be
crucial to the success of SCDM.

of rotating, self-gravitating fluid systems. Our approach is fully nonlinear
and stems from the Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase transitions. In this paper,
we examine fourth-harmonic axisymmetric disturbances in Maclaurin spheroids and
fourth-harmonic nonaxisymmetric disturbances in Jacobi ellipsoids. These two
cases are very similar in the framework of phase transitions. Irrespective of
whether a nonlinear first-order phase transition occurs between the critical
point and the higher turning point or an apparent second-order phase transition
occurs beyond the higher turning point, the result is fission (i.e.
``spontaneous breaking'' of the topology) of the original object on a secular
time scale: the Maclaurin spheroid becomes a uniformly rotating axisymmetric
torus and the Jacobi ellipsoid becomes a binary. The presence of viscosity is
crucial since angular momentum needs to be redistributed for uniform rotation
to be maintained. The phase transitions of the dynamical systems are briefly
discussed in relation to previous numerical simulations of the formation and
evolution of protostellar systems.

redshift the spectra and stretch the temporal structure. We relate the observed
peak intensities, spectral shapes, and time dilation to distance. We include
the uncertainties in our knowledge of the intrinsic spectrum and correct for
the coupling between the spectral shape and the temporal structure. The
reported time dilation between the dimmest BATSE bursts and the bright BATSE
bursts (a factor of 2) requires a redshift of about 6 for the BATSE dimmest
bursts rather than a redshift of 1 or 2 as previously reported. The large
luminosity and distance determined from the time dilation is inconsistent with
the observed Log N-Log P distribution. unless there is very strong evolution.
The implied distance for the dimmest bursts is beyond where galaxies are
thought to form. If true, the gamma-ray bursts would be orphans: no known
objects would have the same distance scale. We conclude that either a large
fraction (65%) of the observed time dilation between the BATSE bright and
dimmest bursts is intrinsic to the bursts or that there are strong evolutionary
effects in the Log N-Log P distribution and that it is only a coincidence that
Log N-Log P shows a -3/2 power law at high intensities.

linewidths for the narrow H$\alpha$ emission lines lie in the range
$170-460\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$. Five of the objects show clear evidence for
asymmetry in the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission-line profile. Broad H$\alpha$
emission is detected in six of the Seyfert galaxies, which range in type from
Seyfert 1.5 to 2. Broad H$\beta$ emission is only detected in one Seyfert
galaxy. The mean full width at half maximum for the broad lines in the Seyfert
galaxies is ${\rm FWHM = 3900\pm 1750\,km\,s^{-1}}$. Broad (${\rm FWHM =
2200\pm 600\,km\,s^{-1}}$) $H\alpha$ emission is also detected in three of the
starburst galaxies, which could originate from stellar winds or supernovae
remnants. The mean Balmer decrement for the sample is H$\alpha$/H$\beta=3$,
consistent with little or no reddening for the bulk of the sample. There is no
evidence for any trend with X-ray luminosity in the ratio of starburst galaxies
to Seyfert galaxies. Based on our previous observations, it is therefore likely

of the 2D sine-Gordon model. With the bosonization, several 1D quantum systems
are also transformed to the same model. However, the transition of the 2D
sine-Gordon model, Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless(BKT) transition, is
essentially different from the second-order transition. The divergence of the
correlation length is more rapid than any power-law, and there are logarithmic
corrections. These pathological features make difficult to determine the BKT
transition point and critical indices from finite-size calculations. In this
paper, we calculate the several correlation functions of this model using a
real-space renormalization technique. It is found that the several correlation
functions, or eigenvalues of the corresponding transfer matrix for a finite
system, become degenerate on the BKT line including logarithmic corrections. By
the use of this degeneracy, which reflects the hidden SU(2) symmetry on the BKT
line,it is possible to determine the BKT critical line with high precision from
small size data, and to identify the universality class. In addition, a new
universal relation is found. This reveals the relation between the Abelian and
the non-Abelian bosonization.

to derive the set of quasilocal densities is a Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of a
suitable covariant action principle for the Ashtekar variables. As such, the
theory presented here is an Ashtekar-variable reformulation of the metric
theory of quasilocal stress-energy-momentum originally due to Brown and York.
This work also investigates how the quasilocal densities behave under
generalized boosts, i. e. switches of the $\Sigma$ slice spanning $B$. It is
shown that under such boosts the densities behave in a manner which is similar
to the simple boost law for energy-momentum four-vectors in special relativity.
The developed formalism is used to obtain a collection of two-surface or boost
invariants. With these invariants, one may ``build"" several different mass

in D=26. If we start from the field theory, in which the string excitations
exist, and change the variables in the path integral to the string variables,
then the Jacobian appears. This Jacobian generates the correction to the
Nambu-Goto action. For this effective action the conformal anomaly cancels in
D=4. Thus we get the quantum string theory in D=4.

a short introduction on strings in Minkowski and curved spacetimes, we focus on
strings in cosmological spacetimes. The classical behaviour of strings in FRW
and inflationary spacetimes is now understood in a large extent from various
types of explicit string solutions. Three different types of behaviour appear
in cosmological spacetimes: {\bf unstable, dual} to unstable and {\bf stable}.
For the unstable strings, the energy and size grow for large scale factors $R
\to \infty$, proportional to $R$. For the dual to unstable strings, the energy
and size blow up for $R\to 0$ as $1/R$. For stable strings, the energy and
proper size are bounded. (In Minkowski spacetime, all string solutions are of
the stable type).Recent progress on self-consistent solutions to the Einstein
equations for string dominated universes is reviewed. The energy-momentum
tensor for a gas of strings is then considered as source of the spacetime
geometry and from the above string behaviours the string equation of state is
determined. The self-consistent string solution exhibits the realistic matter
dominated behaviour $R \sim (X^0)^{2/3}\; $ for large times and the radiation
dominated behaviour $R \sim (X^0)^{1/2}\;$ for early times. Finally, we report
on the exact integrability of the string equations plus the constraints in de
Sitter spacetime that allows to systematically find {\bf exact} string
solutions by soliton methods and the multistring solutions. {\bf Multistring
solutions} are a new feature in curved spacetimes. That is, a single
world-sheet simultaneously describes many different and independent strings.
This phenomenon has no analogue in flat spacetime and follows to the coupling
of the strings with the geometry.
