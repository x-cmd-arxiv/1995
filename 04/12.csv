  to appear in the Astronomical Journal",,"10.1086/117532",,"astro-ph",,"  The origin of the highly eccentric, inclined, and resonance-locked orbit of
Pluto has long been a puzzle. A possible explanation has been proposed recently
[Malhotra, R., {\it Nature} 365:819-21 (1993)] which suggests that these
extraordinary orbital properties may be a natural consequence of the formation
and early dynamical evolution of the outer Solar system. A resonance capture
mechanism is possible during the clearing of the residual planetesimal debris
and the formation of the Oort Cloud of comets by planetesimal mass loss from
the vicinity of the giant planets. If this mechanism were in operation during
the early history of the planetary system, the entire region between the orbit
of Neptune and approximately 50 AU would have been swept by first order mean
motion resonances. Thus, resonance capture could occur not only for Pluto, but
quite generally for other trans-Neptunian small bodies. Some consequences of
this evolution for the present-day dynamical structure of the trans-Neptunian
region are: (i) most of the objects in the region beyond Neptune and up to
$\sim\!50$ AU exist in very narrow zones located at orbital resonances with
Neptune (particularly the 3:2 and the 2:1 resonances), and (ii) these resonant
objects would have significantly large eccentricities. The distribution of
objects in the Kuiper Belt as predicted by this theory is presented here.

we systematically detected the clustering and its evolution of QSO's Ly$\alpha$

Ly$\alpha$ absorbers do exist on scales as large as at least 20 h$^{-1}$ Mpc at
significance levels of 2-4 $\sigma$. Independent data sets show about the same
strength distribution of the decomposed clusters. The number densities of the
clusters on scales of 10 - 20 h$^{-1}$ Mpc are found to evolve in an opposite
sense as that of the lines themselves, i.e. they decrease with redshift. We
also showed that the number density and the strength distribution of clusters
can play an important role in testing or discriminating models, i.e. it can
distinguish real data and simulated samples, which cannot be discriminated by
traditional ways. We used Daubechies 4 and Mallat wavelets as the bases of the
SSD. All above-mentioned conclusions do not depend on either wavelet basis.

near-infrared images of arc(let)s and the ROSAT/HRI X-ray map. A lensing model
is proposed with two dark matter clumps, centered on the two bright galaxies
around which the various arcs are observed. Two of them, close to the most
massive clump around the brightest galaxy, are required to be fold images,
given their position angle with respect to the major axis. A third image for
each of the two arcs is then predicted to be on the opposite side of the major
axis. Both images are indeed found at the expected positions, with consistent
magnitudes, colors and shapes. One of the arcs has a known redshift of $0.7$,
and the model predicts that the other arc should be at higher redshift, $z
\approx 3$. Photometric data in UBrzJK' indicates that a redshift close to 3 is
indeed probable for this arc. The dark matter halo is found to be sharply
peaked on the giant central galaxy. The ROSAT/HRI X-ray map shows a strongly
clumped image, poorly correlated with the cD light and the mass model on scales
below $\sim$ 200$h_{50}^{-1}$kpc, but similar to the distribution of galaxies
and the mass model when smoothed on this scale. The large degree of central
substructure implied helps to account for the discrepancy previously found (in
the two massive clusters A2218 \& A1689) between the mass derived from the
gravitational lenses and that derived from the X-ray profile and temperature
distributions, in a model of hydrostatic equilibrium. Most of the discrepancy
can probably be explained by bulk motions and acceleration of the gas, and
projection effects enhancing the lensing power of the cluster.

density profiles. Cosmological simulations with non-baryonic dark matter
predict however self similar haloes with central density cusps. This
contradiction has lead to the conclusion that dark matter must be baryonic.
Here it is shown that the dark matter haloes of dwarf spiral galaxies represent
a one parameter family with self similar density profiles. The observed global
halo parameters are coupled with each other through simple scaling relations
which can be explained by the standard cold dark matter model if one assumes
that all the haloes formed from density fluctuations with the same primordial
amplitude. We find that the finite central halo densities correlate with the
other global parameters. This result rules out scenarios where the flat halo
cores formed subsequently through violent dynamical processes in the baryonic
component. These cores instead provide important information on the origin and
nature of dark matter in dwarf galaxies.

field has fast temporal decorrelation is studied as a case model for
understanding the appearance of anomalous scaling in turbulent systems. We
demonstrate how the techniques of renormalized perturbation theory lead (after
exact resummations) to equations for the statistical quantities that reveal
also non perturbative effects. It is shown that ultraviolet divergences in the
diagrammatic expansion translate into anomalous scaling with the inner length
acting as the renormalization scale. In this paper we compute analytically the
infinite set of anomalous exponents that stem from the ultraviolet divergences.
Notwithstanding, non-perturbative effects furnish a possibility of anomalous
scaling based on the outer renormalization scale. The mechanism for this
intricate behavior is examined and explained in detail. We show that in the
language of L'vov, Procaccia and Fairhall [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 50}, 4684 (1994)]
the problem is ``critical"" i.e. the anomalous exponent of the scalar primary
field $\Delta=\Delta_c$. This is precisely the condition that allows for
anomalous scaling in the structure functions as well, and we prove that this
anomaly must be based on the outer renormalization scale. Finally, we derive
the scaling laws that were proposed by Kraichnan for this problem, and show
that his scaling exponents are consistent with our theory.

have provided important tests of the Einstein Equivalence Principle, which

Comparisons of atomic clocks with gravitational clocks test the Strong
Equivalence Principle by bounding cosmological variations in Newton's constant.
Stable clocks also play a role in the search for gravitational radiation:
comparision of atomic clocks with the binary pulsar's orbital clock has
verified gravitational-wave damping, and phase-sensitive detection of waves
from inspiralling compact binaries using laser interferometric gravitational
observatories will facilitate extraction of useful source information from the

them it is possible to couple continuum fermions to lattice gauge fields, by
introducing an interpolation of the latter. Following this line of thinking,
this paper presents two Euclidean formulations of the effective action that
appears after functional integration over fermion fields, one for vector-like
and the other for chiral couplings. With suitable finite-mode regulators both
effective actions can be evaluated in a finite computation. The prescriptions
provided here contain some details not found in previous work marrying
continuum fermions to the lattice via an interpolation. For example, the
counter-terms needed to maintain chiral gauge invariance are explicitly given.
By construction coupling-constant renormalization, anomaly structure, and (in
the chiral gauge theory) fermion nonconserving amplitudes all satisfy one's
expectations from perturbative and semi-classical analyses.

to as the finetuning problem. The conspicuous values assumed by many physical
constants (e.g., the vanishing effective cosmological constant, the smallness
of the Higgs mass compared to the Planck scale, the finestructure constants,
$\Theta_{QCD}$) seem to coincide with values that are obtained if one assumes
that Nature in general seeks out multiple point values for intensive
parameters. Multiple point values would occur in the presence of many
coexisting phases. Such coexistence could be enforced by having fixed but not
finetuned amounts of extensive quantities. We show that universally fixed
amounts of extensive quantities is tantamount to having long range nonlocal
interactions of a special type: these interactions are identical between fields
at all pairs of spacetime points regardless of the spacetime distance between
them. Such omnipresent nonlocal interactions, which can be described by a very
general form of a reparameterization invariant action, would not be perceived
as ``action at a distance'' but rather most likely incorporated into our theory
as constants of Nature. Hence one can speculate that this mild form of
nonlocality is the underlying explanation of Nature's affinity for the multiple
point. We also speculate that nonlocal effects, described by fields depending
on two spacetime points, may be responsible for the replication of the fields
in three generations. Such a nonlocal mechanism would also triple the number of
boson fields, as in the antigrand unification model. We briefly review the
multiple point predictions for the three fine structure constants and the
resolution of the quark-lepton mass hierarchy problem in this antigrand unified
extension of the Standard Model.
