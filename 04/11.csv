  Keywords: simulatability, computability, dynamics, emergence, system
  representation, universal simulator",,,,"adap-org nlin.AO",,"  Unlike computation or the numerical analysis of differential equations,
simulation does not have a well established conceptual and mathematical
foundation. Simulation is an arguable unique union of modeling and computation.
However, simulation also qualifies as a separate species of system
representation with its own motivations, characteristics, and implications.
This work outlines how simulation can be rooted in mathematics and shows which
properties some of the elements of such a mathematical framework has. The
properties of simulation are described and analyzed in terms of properties of
dynamical systems. It is shown how and why a simulation produces emergent
behavior and why the analysis of the dynamics of the system being simulated
always is an analysis of emergent phenomena. A notion of a universal simulator
and the definition of simulatability is proposed. This allows a description of
conditions under which simulations can distribute update functions over system
components, thereby determining simulatability. The connection between the
notion of simulatability and the notion of computability is defined and the
concepts are distinguished. The basis of practical detection methods for
determining effectively non-simulatable systems in practice is presented. The
conceptual framework is illustrated through examples from molecular
self-assembly end engineering.

and a late ($z_f \sim 1$) era of galaxy formation respectively. Galaxy
evolution has been treated by considering a variety of stellar types, different
initial mass functions and star formation histories, and with an accounting of
dust absorption and emission. We find that the dominant factor influencing the
EBL is the epoch of galaxy formation. A recently proposed method for observing
the EBL utilizing the absorption of $\sim 0.1$ to 10 TeV gamma-rays from active
galactic nuclei (AGN) is shown to be capable of discriminating between
different galaxy formation epochs. The one AGN viewed in TeV light, Mrk 421,
does show some evidence for a cutoff above 3 TeV; based on the EBL models
presented here, we suggest that this is due to extinction in the source. The
large absorption predicted at energies $>200$ GeV for sources at $z>0.5$
indicates that observations of TeV gamma-ray bursts (GRB) would constrain or
eliminate models in which the GRB sources lie at cosmological distances.

disordered $O(n)$ model in $d-2$ dimensions. The pure system has a stable fixed
point only for $n>4$ and so the physical case ($n = 2$) is likely to have a
