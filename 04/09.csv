functions by means of the multivariate Edgeworth expansion. We stress the
potential interest of this technique in all those cosmological problems in
which the determination of a non-Gaussian signature is relevant, e.g. in the
analysis of large scale structure and cosmic microwave background. A first
important result is that the asymptotic confidence limits on the parameters are
systematically widened when the higher order correlation functions are
positive, with respect to the Gaussian case.

magnetization relaxation (S), dominated by quantum tunneling, is $\propto{\sqrt
j_c}$, which crosses over to the conventional classical rate $\propto T/j_c$ at
higher $T$ and lower $j_c$, with the crossover $T^*\sim j_c^{3/2}$. I argue
that due to interactions between flux lines there exist three relaxation
regimes, depending on whether $B<B_\phi$, $B\approx B_\phi$, $B>B_\phi$,
corresponding to Strongly-pinned Bose Glass (SBG) with large $j_{c2}$, Mott
Insulator (MI) with vanishing S, and Weakly-pinned Bose Glass (WBG)
characterized by small $j_{c1}$. I discuss the effects of interactions on $j_c$
and focus attention on the recent experiment which is consistently described by
the theory.

$SU(2)$ instanton is solved completely, revealing an underlying multi-link
intersection theory. Link invariants are also shown to survive the coupling to
a certain kind of matter (hyperinstantons). The physical relevance of
topological field theory and its invariants is discovered. By embedding
topological Yang-Mills theory into pure Yang-Mills theory, it is shown that the
topological version TQFT of a quantum field theory QFT allows us to formulate
consistently the perturbative expansion of QFT in the topologically nontrivial
sectors. In particular, TQFT classifies the set of good measures over the
instanton moduli space and solves the inconsistency problems of the previous
approaches. The qualitatively new physical implications are pointed out. Link
numbers in QCD are related to a non abelian analogoue of the Aharonov-Bohm
effect.
