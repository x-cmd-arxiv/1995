components (A and B) of UM 425, thought to be images, separated by 6.5"", of the
same z = 1.47 quasar. These components have been imaged through an R filter in
order to obtain their light curves. The photometry was obtained by
simultaneously fitting a stellar two-dimensional profile on each component. The
brightest image (component A, m(R) = 15.7) shows a slow and smooth increase in
brightness of 0.2 magnitude in seven years, while the faintest one (component
B, m(R) = 20.1) displays an outburst of 0.4 magnitude which lasts approximately
two years. The variation of component B may be interpreted in two ways,
assuming UM 425 is gravitationally lensed. If it is due to an intrinsic
variation of the quasar, we derive a lower limit of 3 years on the time delay
from the fact that it is not observed in component A. On the other hand, if it
is a microlensing ``High Amplification Event'', we estimate the size of the
source to be ~ 10^{-3} pc, in agreement with standard models of AGNs. These
observations are consistent with the gravitational lens interpretation of the
object.
  Furthermore, all the CCD frames obtained under the best seeing conditions
have been co-added, in an attempt to detect the deflector. The final R image
reveals a rich field of faint galaxies in the magnitude range m(R) 22-24. No
obvious deflector, nor any system of arcs or arclets is detected, down to a
limiting magnitude of m(R) 24.

spectra which lead to anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The
amplitudes and shapes of these spectra can be parametrized by $Q_S^2$, $r\equiv
Q_T^2/Q_S^2$, $n_S$ and $n_T$ where $Q_S^2$ and $Q_T^2$ are the scalar and
tensor contributions to the square of the CMB quadrupole and $n_S$ and $n_T$
are the power-lawspectral indices. Even if we restrict ourselves to information
from angles greater than one third of a degree, three of these observables can
be measured with some precision. The combination $130^{1-n_S}Q_S^2$ can be
known to better than $\pm 0.3\%$. The scalar index $n_S$ can be determined to
better than $\pm 0.02$. The ratio $r$ can be known to about $\pm 0.1$ for $n_S
\simeq 1$ and slightly better for smaller $n_S$. The precision with which $n_T$
can be measured depends weakly on $n_S$ and strongly on $r$. For $n_S \simeq 1$
$n_T$ can be determined with a precision of about $\pm 0.056(1.5+r)/r$. A
full-sky experiment with a $20'$beam using technology available today, similar
to those being planned by several groups, can achieve the above precision. Good
angular resolution is more important than high signal-to-noise ratio; for a
given detector sensitivity and observing time a smaller beam provides
significantly more information than a larger beam. The uncertainties in $n_S$
and $r$ are roughly proportional to the beam size. We briefly discuss the
effects of uncertainty in the Hubble constant, baryon density, cosmological
constant and ionization history.

the full relativistic expression for photon splitting at neutron star magnetic
field strengths (Mentzel et al. 1994). Using these results we demonstrate that
Adler's (1971) widely used approximation formula for photon splitting
underestimates the correct splitting rate by {\em several} orders of magnitude,
at these magnetic field strengths. Even down at X-ray energies of a few tens of
keV magnetic photon splitting is found to be an efficient photon conversion
process, producing mean free paths as short as several tens of centimeters for
fields on the order of $5 \times 10^{12}$ gauss. We conclude that previous
analyses of the contributions of magnetic photon splitting to spectral
formation based on Adler's approximation formula are physically unreliable,
and, in particular, that photon splitting must be included in realistic
modelings of spectra of both strongly magnetized cosmic X-ray and $\gamma$-ray

providing meanings for lexical items and rules for determining the meaning of
larger units given the meanings of their parts. Meanings are often assumed to
combine via function application, which works well when constituent structure
trees are used to guide semantic composition. However, we believe that the
functional structure of Lexical-Functional Grammar is best used to provide the
syntactic information necessary for constraining derivations of meaning in a
cross-linguistically uniform format. It has been difficult, however, to
reconcile this approach with the combination of meanings by function
application. In contrast to compositional approaches, we present a deductive
approach to assembling meanings, based on reasoning with constraints, which
meshes well with the unordered nature of information in the functional
structure. Our use of linear logic as a `glue' for assembling meanings allows
for a coherent treatment of the LFG requirements of completeness and coherence
as well as of modification and quantification.

kinetic-like term for the dilaton) interacting with scalar matter near two
dimensions. The one-loop effective action and the beta functions for this
general theory are written down. It is proven that the theory possesses a
non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point which yields an asymptotically free
gravitational coupling constant (at $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$) in this regime.
Moreover, at the fixed point the theory can be cast under the form of a
string-inspired model with free scalar matter. The renormalization of the
Jackiw-Teitelboim model and of lineal gravity in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions is
also discussed. We show that these two theories are distinguished at the
quantum level. Finally, fermion-dilatonic gravity near two dimensions is
considered.

type IIA superstring is combined with the conjectured equivalence of the latter
to a compactified 11-dimensional supermembrane to derive a string membrane
duality in seven dimensions; the membrane is a soliton of the string theory and
vice versa. A prediction of this duality is that the heterotic string is a
$K_3$ compactification of the solitonic 11-dimensional fivebrane. It is
verified that the worldsheet action of the D=10 heterotic string is indeed
obtainable by $K_3$ compactification of the worldvolume action of the
11-dimensional fivebrane, and it is suggested how the worldvolume action of the
D=11 supermebrane may be similarly obtained by $T^3$ compactification of the
worldvolume action of a D=10 heterotic fivebrane. Generalizations to $D=8$
string-threebrane and membrane-membrane duality are also discussed.

function of Rayleigh number for several negative and positive Soret coupling
strengths (separation ratios) and different Lewis and Prandtl numbers
characterizing different mixtures. A finite difference method was used to solve
the full hydrodynamic field equations in a range of experimentally accessible
parameters. We elucidate the important role that the concentration field plays
in the nonlinear states of stationary overturning convection (SOC) and of
traveling wave (TW) convection. Structural differences in the concentration
boundary layers and of the concentration plumes in TW's and SOC's and their
physical consequences are discussed. These properties show that the states con-
sidered here are indeed strongly nonlinear, as expected from the magnitude of
advection and diffusion in the concentration balance. The bifurcation behaviour
of the states is analysed using different order parameters such as flow
intensity, Nusselt number, a newly defined mixing parameter characterized by
the variance of the concentration field, and the TW frequency. For further
comparison with experiments, light intensity distributions are determined that
can be observed in side-view shadowgraphs. Structural analyses of all fields
are made using colour coded isoplots, vertical and lateral field profiles, and
lateral Fourier decompositions. Transport properties of TWs are also discussed,
in particular the mean lateral concentration current that is caused by the
phase difference between concentration wave and velocity wave and that is
roughly proportional to the TW frequency. This current plays an important role
in the structural dynamics and stability of spatially-localized traveling-wave
convection (cf. accompanying paper).
