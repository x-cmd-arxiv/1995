sufficiently large to get a gel structure at the end of the process. In the
case of monodisperse spheres, the wavevector dependent scattered intensity
$I(q)$ is calculated from the product of the form factor $P(q)$ of a sphere by
the structure factor $S(q)$, which is related to the Fourier transform of
$g(r)-1$, where $g(r)$ is the pair correlation function between sphere centers.
The structure factor $S(q)$ exhibits large-$q$ damped oscillations
characteristics of the short range (intra-aggregate) correlations between
spheres. These oscillations influence the $I(q)$ curve in the $q$-region
between the fractal regime and the Porod regime and quantitative comparisons
are made with experiments on colloidal aerogels. Moreover, at small-$q$ values,
$S(q)$ goes through a maximum characteristic of large range (inter-aggregate)
correlations. Quantitative fits of the maximum in the experimental $I(q)$
curves of base-catalyzed aerogel are presented. In the case of polydisperse
spheres, $I(q)$ is calculated directly from a single aggregate simulation. It
is shown that increasing polydispersity shifts the location of the cross-over
between the fractal and Porod regimes towards low $q$-value.

These fields can be thought of as either moduli or as the Nambu-Goldstone
bosons of the spontaneously broken flavor symmetry which is non-linearly
realized by the soft terms. We show that the soft terms align with the quark
and lepton Yukawa couplings, just as spins align with an external magnetic
field. As a result, the soft terms conserve individual lepton numbers and do
not cause large flavor or CP violations. The vacuum adjusts so as to allow
large sparticle splittings to naturally coexist with flavor conservation.
Consequently, the resulting phenomenology is different from that of minimal
supersymmetric theories. We also propose theories in which the shape of the
soft terms in flavor space is a dynamical variable which depends on fields that
have no tree level potential. This dynamically leads to partial degeneracy
among sparticles and further supression of flavor violations. The ideas of this
paper suggest a connection between the space of moduli and the spontaneously

superspace with a double set of $SU(2)$ harmonic variables, we present its
generalization which provides an off-shell description of a wide class of
$(4,4)$ sigma models with torsion and non-commuting left and right complex
structures. The distinguishing features of the action constructed are: (i) a
nonabelian and in general nonlinear gauge invariance ensuring a correct number
of physical degrees of freedom; (ii) an infinite tower of auxiliary fields. For
a particular class of such models we explicitly demonstrate the
non-commutativity of complex structures on the bosonic target.

curvature function over the world line possess $n+1$ gauge invariances. A
geometrical characterization of these symmetries is obtained via Frenet
equations by rephrasing the $n$-th curvature model in $\reals^d$ in terms of a
standard relativistic particle in $S^{d-n}$. We ``prove by example'' that the
algebra of these infinitesimal gauge invariances is nothing but $\W_{n+2}$,
thus providing a geometrical picture of the $\W$-symmetry for these models. As
a spin-off of our approach we give a new global invariant for four-dimensional
curves subject to a curvature constraint.

"hep-th/9504072",,"Vu B Ho","A geometric formulation of strong interaction","Latex, 5 pages",,,,"hep-th gr-qc",,"  It is observed that, at short range, the field equations of general
relativity admit a line element that takes the form of Yukawa potential. The
result leads to the possibility that strong interaction may also be described
by field equations that have the same form as that of general relativity. It is
then shown how such field equations may arise from the coupling of two strong
fields.

continuous} if it carries weakly convergent sequences into norm convergent
sequences. Isolated is a universal operator for the class of
non-completely-continuous operators from $L_1$ into an arbitrary Banach space,
namely, the operator from $L_1$ into $\ell_\infty$ defined by $$ T_0 (f)
=\left( \int r_n f \, d\mu \right)_{n\ge 0} \ , $$ where $r_n$ is the
$n^{\text{th}}$ Rademacher function. It is also shown that there does not exist
a universal operator for the class of non-completely-continuous operators
between two arbitrary Banach space. The proof uses the factorization theorem
for weakly compact operators and a Tsirelson-like space.

"math/9504213",,"Jonathan Berry, Mark Goldberg","Path optimization and near-greedy analysis for graph partitioning: an
  empirical study",,,,"LACES 68Q-95-25","math.CO cs.CC",,"  This paper presents the results of an experimental study of graph
partitioning. We describe a new heuristic technique, path optimization, and its
application to two variations of graph partitioning: the max_cut problem and
the min_quotient_cut problem. We present the results of computational
comparisons between this technique and the Kernighan-Lin algorithm, the
simulated annealing algorithm, the FLOW-lagorithm the multilevel algorithm, and
teh recent 0.878-approximation algorithm. The experiments were conducted on two
classes of graphs that have become standard for such tests: random and random
geometric. They show that for both classes of inputs and both variations of the
problem, the new heuristic is competitive with the other algorithms and holds
an advantage for min_quotient_cut when applied to very large, sparse geometric
graphs. In the last part of the paper, we describe an approach to analyzing
graph partitioning algorithms from the statistical point of view. Every
partitioning of a graph is viewed as a result achieved by a ""near gready""
partitioning algorithm. The experiments show that for ""good"" partitionings, the
number of non-greedy steps needed to obtain them is quite small; moreover, it
is ""statistically"" smaller for better partitionings. This led us to conjecture
that there exists an ""optimal"" distribution of the non-greedy steps that
characterize the classes of graphs that we studied.

vector current hypothesis is confirmed through the observed constancy of the
vector coupling constant determined from the superallowed Fermi transitions and
from the measurement of the weak-magnetism term in mirror Gamow-Teller
transitions. The axial-vector and pseudoscalar coupling constants in the
nucleon are determined from neutron decay and muon capture on the proton
respectively. In finite nuclei, evidence for these coupling constants being
reduced relative to their free-nucleon values is discussed. Meson-exchange
currents are shown to be an important correction to the time-like part of the
axial current as evident in first-forbidden beta decays. Tests of the Standard
Model are discussed, as well as extensions beyond it involving right-hand
currents and scalar interactions.
