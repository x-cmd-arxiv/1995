From
their optical emission lines these objects are classified as narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1), almost all with extremely large Fe II/H-beta ratios
and relatively narrow optical lines of hydrogen. Our results are based on a
systematic study of 46 NLS1. We find that NLS1 have generally steeper soft
X-ray continuum slopes than normal Seyfert 1s, and there may exist an
anticorrelation between 0.1-2.4 keV continuum slope and the FWHM of the H-beta
line. Objects with steep 0.1-2.4 keV continuum slopes and H-beta FWHM > 3000 km
s^{-1} are clearly discriminated against by nature. When simple power-law
models are fit to the data, photon indices reach values up to about 5, much
higher than is usually seen in Seyfert 1s. We discuss steep ROSAT spectra in
light of soft X-ray excess and hard X-ray tail models. We consider models for
NLS1 where they are Seyfert 1s with extremal values of pole-on orientation,
black hole mass and/or accretion rate, warm absorption and BLR thickness and
confront these models with the known properties of NLS1. All simple models
appear to have drawbacks, but models with smaller mass black holes and thicker
BLRs show some promise. We suggest specific further tests of the models.

merger involving a low-mass satellite companion. During a prograde satellite
accretion, the disk galaxy forms a strong bar in response to the perturbation
of the companion. After the accretion event is over, the bar buckles vertically
due to a bending instability, sending disk material well out of the disk plane.
The material forms into an X-shaped feature when seen edge-on, morphologically
similar to X-structures observed in several S0/Sa galaxies. The mechanism
described here unites previously suggested accretion and bar instability
hypotheses for forming X-structures into a self-consistent scenario for
merger-induced formation and evolution of S0 galaxies. To complement these
models, we also present observations of the peculiar S0 galaxy Hickson 87a. The
thick disk, isophotal warping, and strong X-structure described in the merger
model are all evident in Hickson 87a, suggesting this galaxy may be an
excellent example of such merger-induced galaxy evolution.

MS~0225.5+3121. Mrk~1040 was found to have decreased in flux by almost a factor
of 4 since an {\it EXOSAT} observation 10\,years ago. The energy spectrum of
Mrk~1040 displays complexity both at soft energies (below 0.8\thinspace keV)
and at hard energies (6--7\thinspace keV). The latter is readily interpreted as
fluorescent K$\alpha$ emission from cold iron expected when the primary X-ray
source illuminates cold optically-thick material. This line is both broad (with
FWHM 16\,000--70\,000 km\,s$^{-1}$) and strong (equivalent width $\sim 550\pm
250$\, eV) suggesting that it originates from material close to the compact
object with non-solar abundances. Abundance effects on the equivalent width of
such a line are investigated via Monte Carlo simulations. We find that strong
lines can be produced with physically plausible abundances. The effect of
abundances on the associated reflection continuum is also discussed. The soft
spectral complexity implies either a strong soft excess together with intrinsic
absorption, or a complex absorber. Various models for the nature of such a
complex absorber are discussed. MS~0225.5+3121 shows no evidence for any
variability and has a spectrum that is well described by a power law with
Galactic absorption.

challenge it presents to theoretical frameworks for cluster dynamics. Recently,
the model of diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) has been applied to describe
urban growth, and results in tree-like dendritic structures which have a core

exists only one large fractal cluster that is almost perfectly screened from
incoming ``development units'' (people, capital, resources, etc), so that
almost all the cluster growth occurs in the extreme peripheral tips. Here we
propose and develop an alternative model to DLA that describes the morphology

urban perimeter of individual cities. Our results agree both qualitatively and
quantitatively with actual urban data. The resulting growth morphology can be
understood in terms of the effects of interactions among the constituent units

model in the presence of a gradient.

are presented assuming non--vanishing strange quark form factors for the
constituent nucleons. For charged current processes the exchange current
corrections can lower the impulse approximation results by 10\% while these
corrections are found to be sensitive to both the nuclear density and the
strange quark axial form factor of the nucleon for neutral current processes.
Implications on the LSND experiment to determine this form factor are
discussed.

dilepton and charmonium production, especially the x-dependence of the
suppression, can be explained by the absorption of fast initial partons. We
assume the absorption to be x1-dependent and determine the empirical form of
this dependence. Several reactions at different energies are described with the
same parametrization of the absorption cross section. The factorization theorem
constraints and some alternative models are discussed. The obtained description
of data allows to make conclusions about the origin of nuclear effects in
hadro- and electroproduction. In particular, it is concluded that the parton
recombination and the excess pion contribution are unimportant in nuclei and an
indication of excess gluons at $x_{2}\sim 0.1$ is observed.

operator $\vr$, which is related to the ordinary density matrix via
$\rho=\vr\vr^\dagger$. This formalism allows a (generalized) unitary evolution
between pure and mixed states. It also preserves much of the connection between
symmetries and conservation laws. The new formalism is illustrated for the case
of a two level system.
