non-affine A-type Toda equation system for the d-fold M. This non-affine
property originates in the vanishing first Chern class of M. Using the results
of the $A{A^{\ast}}$-equation, we obtain a genus one partition function of the
sigma model associated to the M in the recipe of the holomorphic anomaly. By
taking an asymmetrical limit of the complexified {\kae} parameters
${\bar{t}\rightarrow \infty}$ and $t$ is fixed, the ${A^{\ast}}$(M)-model part
is decoupled and we can obtain a partition function (or one point function of
the operator ${{\cal O}^{(1)}}$ associated to a {\kae} form of M) of the
$A$(M)-matter coupled with the topological gravity at the stringy one loop
level. The coefficients of the series expansion with respect to an
indeterminate $q:={e^{2\pi i t}}$ are integrals of the top Chern class of the
vector bundle {\Large $\nu $} over the moduli space of stable maps with
definite degrees.

two types of quantum systems. In the first we consider quantum mechanics on
coset spaces G/H, and argue that G-invariance is central to the emergence of
the H-connection as induced gauge fields in the different quantum sectors. We
then demonstrate why the same connection, now giving rise to the non-abelian
generalization of Berry's phase, can also be found in systems which have slow
variables taking values in such a coset space.

the physical vacuum, and the corresponding mathematics are discrete on the
Planck scale we develop a certain framework in form of a '{\it cellular
network}' consisting of cells interacting with each other via bonds. Both the
internal states of the cells and the ""strength"" of the bonds are assumed to be
dynamical variables. In section 3 the basis is laid for a version of '{\it
discrete analysis}' which, starting from different, perhaps more physically
oriented principles, manages to make contact with the much more abstract
machinery of Connes et al. and may complement the latter approach. In section 4
a, as far as we can see, new concept of '{\it topological dimension}' in form
of a '{\it degree of connectivity}' for graphs, networks and the like is
developed. It is then indicated how this '{\it dimension}', which for
continuous structures or lattices being embedded in a continuous background
agrees with the usual notion of dimension, may change dynamically as a result
of a '{\it phase transition like}' change in '{\it connectivity}' in the
network. A certain speculative argument, along the lines of statistical
mechanics, is supplied in favor of the naturalness of dimension 4 of ordinary
(classical) space-time.

the notion ``$A_\hbar$ converges in the classical limit''. The limit is a
function on phase space. Convergence is in norm in the sense that $A_\hbar\to0$
is equivalent with $\Vert A_\hbar\Vert\to0$. The $\hbar$-wise product of
convergent observables converges to the product of the limiting phase space
functions. $\hbar^{-1}$ times the commutator of suitable observables converges
to the Poisson bracket of the limits. For a large class of convergent
Hamiltonians the $\hbar$-wise action of the corresponding dynamics converges to
the classical Hamiltonian dynamics. The connections with earlier approaches,
based on the WKB method, or on Wigner distribution functions, or on the limits
of coherent states are reviewed.
