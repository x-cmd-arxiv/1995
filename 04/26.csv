peculiar-velocity fields is presented. The calculation is purely Lagrangian and
it is derived using the second-order solutions of the Lagrange-Newton system
obtained by Buchert & Ehlers. The procedure is applied to two particular
solutions given generic initial conditions. In this approach, the continuity
equation yields a relation between the over-density and peculiar-velocity
fields that automatically satisfies Euler's equation because the orbits are
derived from the Lagrange-Newton system. This scheme generalizes some results
obtained by Nusser et al. (1991) in the context of the Zel'dovich
approximation. As opposed to several other reconstruction schemes, in this
approach it is not necessary to truncate the expansion of the Jacobian given by
the continuity equation in order to calculate a first- or second-order
expression for the density field. In these previous schemes, the density
contrast given by (a) the continuity equation and (b) Euler's equation are
mutually incompatible. This inconsistency arises as a consequence of an
improper handling of Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates in the analysis. Here,
we take into account the fact that an exact calculation of the density is
feasible in the Lagrangian picture and therefore an accurate and consistent
description is obtained.

photometric surveys provides converging evidences that this intermediate
population is a sequel of the violent heating of early disc populations by a
merging satellite galaxy.
  The thick disc population is revisited under the light of new data in a
number of galactic sample fields. Various thick disc hypotheses are fitted to
observational data through a maximum likelihood technique. The resulting
characteristics of the thick disc are the following : a scale height of 760
$\pm$ 50 pc, with a local density of 5.6 $\pm$ 1 \% of the thin disc. The scale
length is constrained to be 2.8 $\pm$ 0.8 kpc, well in agreement with the disc
scale length (2.5 $\pm$ 0.3 kpc). The mean metallicity of the thick disc is
found to be -0.7 $\pm$ 0.2 dex, with no {significant} metallicity gradients.
  These photometric constraints in combination with kinematic data give new
constraints on the thick disc formation. We show that thick disc
characteristics are {hardly compatible with a top-down formation scenario} but
fully compatible with a violent merging event arising at the early thin disc
life time as described by Quinn, Hernquist \& Fullagar (1993).

been given for it. This thesis provides one for those infelicities that occur
when a pragmatic inference is cancelled.
  Our contribution assumes the existence of a finer grained taxonomy with
respect to pragmatic inferences. It is shown that if one wants to account for
the natural language expressiveness, one should distinguish between pragmatic
inferences that are felicitous to defeat and pragmatic inferences that are
infelicitously defeasible. Thus, it is shown that one should consider at least
three types of information: indefeasible, felicitously defeasible, and
infelicitously defeasible. The cancellation of the last of these determines the
pragmatic infelicities.
  A new formalism has been devised to accommodate the three levels of
information, called ``stratified logic''. Within it, we are able to express
formally notions such as ``utterance U presupposes P'' or ``utterance U is
infelicitous''. Special attention is paid to the implications that our work has
in solving some well-known existential philosophical puzzles. The formalism
yields an algorithm for computing interpretations for utterances, for
determining their associated presuppositions, and for signalling infelicitous
utterances that has been implemented in Common Lisp. The algorithm applies
equally to simple and complex utterances and sequences of utterances.

widths leads to a significant alteration of the result obtained in the
zero-width approximation usually discussed in the literature. The origin of
this strong momentum dependence lies in the difference between the rho and
omega meson widths.

Starting from path integral representations for scattering observables, we
present results of numerical calculations for potential scattering and
scattering off a schematic $^4 \rm He $ nucleus. The convergence properties of
Monte-Carlo algorithms for scattering systems are analyzed using stochastic
differential equation as a path sampling method.

  algebras, II. Parafermionic space","34 pages, 2 tables, Latex",,,,"q-alg hep-th math.QA",,"  The standard modules for an affine Lie algebra $\ga$ have natural
subquotients called parafermionic spaces -- the underlying spaces for the
so-called parafermionic conformal field theories associated with $\ga.$
  We study the case $\ga = \widehat{sl}(n+1,\C)$ for any positive integral
level $k \geq 2.$ Generalizing the $\cal Z$-algebra approach of Lepowsky,
Wilson and Primc, we construct a combinatorial basis for the parafermionic
spaces in terms of colored partitions. The parts of these partitions represent
''Fourier coefficients'' of generalized vertex operators (parafermionic
currents) and can be interpreted as statistically interacting quasi-particles
of color $i,\;1\leq i \leq n,$ and charge $s,\; 1\leq s \leq k-1.$ From a
combinatorial point of view, these bases are essentially identical with the
bases for level $k-1$ principal subspaces constructed by the author in [GeI].
In the particular case of the vacuum module, the character (string function)
associated with our basis is the formula of Kuniba, Nakanishi and Suzuki [KNS]
conjectured in a Bethe Ansatz layout.
  New combinatorial characters are established for the whole standard vacuum
$\ga$-modules.
