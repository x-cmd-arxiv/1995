the cluster at a distance of 6 arcmin from the core. The location of this
emission along the direction of proper motion of the cluster suggests that it
might be due to a bow shock. We show that a simple shock model fits the
observed luminosity and temperature. However, a bow shock can only form if the
rotation of the halo gas at the height of 47 Tuc (z = 3.3 kpc) is small
compared to the rotation of the galactic plane. Therefore this observation
provides not only the first x-ray detection of hot gas in a globular cluster,
but also constrains the dynamics of the halo gas. We also find two sources of
diffuse x-ray emission to the NE of the cluster which are brighter and harder.
We consider a variety of models for this emission, including thermal emission
from a high velocity wind from a hot white dwarf, and propose that it is due to
inverse Compton emission from acceleration in the bow shock of low energy
cosmic ray electrons from the population of millisecond pulsars in the cluster.

found in nonleptonic decays at next to leading order in $1/N_c$, concentrating
on quark exchange mechanism. The contradiction originates in the fact that the
standard factorization assumption approximates the asymptotic final states by a
non-orthogonal set of states, thus leading to an overcounting of the decay
probability. We consider a system with two heavy quarks treated as classical
color sources with constant velocity, and two mass-degenerate antiquarks.
Exploiting permutation symmetry in an adiabatic approximation, we find that
final state interaction restores duality. Three $O(1/N_c)$ effects are
exhibited: i) a proper treatment of orthogonality yields a global correction
$1/N_c\to 1/2N_c$ within a generalized factorization \`a la BSW, (such a factor
was present in an Ansatz by Shifman), ii) the distorsion of the meson wave
functions at the time of the weak decay, iii) relative phases generated by the
later evolution. The latter effect becomes dominant for light antiquarks or for
a small velocity of the final mesons, and may thoroughly modify the
factorization picture. For exclusive decay it may interchange the role of class
I and class II final channels, and for semi-inclusive decay it may lead to an
equal sharing of the probability between the two sets of final states. In the
heavy antiquark and large velocity limit, the replacement $1/N_c\to 1/2N_c$ is
the dominant correction.

function is a convolution of components $W_N$ for an isolated nucleon and
$W_{\NA}$ for a nucleus composed of point-nucleons. $W_N$ is represented by its
elastic and lowest-energy inelastic parts, while $W_{\NA}$ is computed from its
asymptotic limit, supplemented by final state interactions due to binary
collisions between the knocked-out and core nucleons. $(q/M)W_{\NA}$ per
nucleon appears to be practically independent of mass number $A$ and momentum
transfer $q$. Consequently, predicted inclusive cross sections per nucleon for
given kinematic conditions hardly depend on the target and the same can be
extracted from the data. Exceptions are low energy loss regions, where
relatively small cross sections are shown to be sensitive to details of the
single nucleon momentum distribution and to FSI, involving multiple collisions.
The agreement with the data is good.

spatiotemporal chaos, we have investigated the defect--defect correlation
functions in the defect turbulence regime of the two--dimensional, anisotropic
complex Ginzburg--Landau equation. We compare our results with the predictions
of generic scale invariance. Using the topological nature of the defects, we
prove that defect--defect correlations cannot decay as slowly as predicted by
generic scale invariance. We also present results on the fluctuations of the
amplitude field $A$.

microwave field is presented. The analysis is based on the scale transformation
which reduces the number of parameters and reveals the functional dependencies
of the processes. It is shown that the observed ionisation of Rydberg atoms by
subpicosecond electromagnetic pulses scale classically. The threshold electric
field required to ionise a Rydberg state may be simply evaluated in the
photonic basis approach for the quantum dynamics or from the multiphoton
ionisation theory.
