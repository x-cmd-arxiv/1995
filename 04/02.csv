  galaxies","14 pages, latex documentstyle {l-aa}",,,"OAUJ 95-01","astro-ph",,"  The evolution of large-scale magnetic fields in disk galaxies is investigated
numerically. The gasdynamical simulations in a disk perturbed by spiral or bar
potential are incorporated into the kinematic calculations of induction
equations to elucidate the effects of non-axisymmetric disk structure on
magnetic fields. The effects of interstellar turbulence are given as the
turbulent diffusion of magnetic fields. The usually adopted dynamo mechanism of
alpha-effect is not considered in our computations, because it is not obvious
about the actual existence of the effect in a galaxy. Our principal concern is
to clear how observationally and theoretically well-established gas flow
affects the magnetic-field structure and evolution, without putting a lot of
artificial parameters in the model. We have found that the density-wave
streaming motion of gas has a significant influence on the distribution of
magnetic fields: the lines of force are well aligned with spiral arms due to
the compressional and additional shearing flow of gas in these regions.

local relaxation times offer a natural time scale, too. Generalizing existing
proposals, we relate {\it thermodynamic} time scale to the standard kinetic
coefficients of irreversible thermodynamics. Criteria for minimum entropy
production in slow, slightly irreversible processes are discussed.
Euler-Lagrange equations are derived for optimum thermodynamic control for
fixed clock-time period as well as for fixed {\it thermodynamic} time period.
Only this latter requires constant thermodynamic speed as the optimum control
proposed earlier. An easy-to-implement stepwise algorithm is constructed to
realize control at constant thermodynamic speed. Since thermodynamic time is
shown to correspond to the number of steps, thus the sophisticated task of
determining thermodynamic time in real control problems can be substituted by
measuring ordinary intensive variables. Most remarkably, optimum paths are
Riemannian geodesics which would not be the case had we used ordinary time.

boson, the CC and NC cross sections have comparable magnitudes, demonstrating
the equal strengths of the weak and electromagnetic interactions at high $Q^2$.
The $Q^2$ dependence of the CC cross section determines the mass term in the CC
propagator to be $M_{W} = 76 \pm 16 \pm 13$~GeV.

includes resummation of supposedly large perturbative corrections, originating
from the running of the strong coupling. We argue that the low value of the BLM
scale found previously for inclusive decays is a manifestation of the
renormalon divergence of the perturbative series starting already in third
order. A reliable determination of $|V_{cb}|$ from inclusive decays is possible
if one either uses a short-distance b quark mass or eliminates all unphysical
mass parameters in terms of measured observables, such that all infra-red
contributions of order $1/m_b$ cancel explicitly. We find that using the
$\overline{\rm MS}$ running mass significantly reduces the perturbative
coefficients already in low orders. For a semileptonic branching ratio of
$10.9\%$ we obtain $|V_{cb}|(\tau_B/1.50\,{\rm ps})^{1/2}= 0.041\pm 0.002$ from
inclusive decays, in good agreement with the value extracted from exclusive
decays.

directions for three-dimensionally expanding, finite systems. These are
discussed in detail for the case of a longitudinally expanding system with a
transverse flow and a transverse temperature profile. For systems with large
geometrical sizes we find an $m_t$-scaling for the parameters of the
Bose-Einstein correlation function, which may be valid in the whole transverse
mass region for certain model parameters. In this limit, the Bose-Einstein
correlations view only a small part of the source. The large geometrical sizes
can be inferred from a simultaneous analysis of the invariant momentum
distribution and the Bose-Einstein correlation function. A preliminary analysis
of the NA44 data indicates that instead of a small fireball we are observing a
big and expanding snowball in $S + Pb $ reactions at CERN SPS energies.
