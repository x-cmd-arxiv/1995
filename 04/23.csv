"astro-ph/9504077","Nir J. Shaviv","Nir J. Shaviv","On the Source and Location of Temporal Variability in Fireballs","3 pages, latex, no figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Most cosmological models for gamma-ray bursts invoke the production of a
``fireball'' in a compact region, as indicated by the short time variability of
the observed GRBs. The high density of $e^+e^-$ pairs in such fireballs
inevitably makes them opaque to gamma-rays and requires the gamma-ray emission
to take place only after the fireball has expanded and became optically thin to
gamma's. Many of the ``traditional'' scenarios explain the temporal variability
of GRBs as being formed by growing instabilities in the expanding fireball.
Here we explore this possiblity and examine its validity.

Galactic bulge is statistically estimated from Einstein ring crossing times
$t_{\rm e}$. For a Gaussian mass function, the best fitting parameters are
$\langle \log (m/M_{\odot}) \rangle = -1.12$ and $\sigma_{\log (m/M_{\odot})} =
0.57$. If the mass function follows a power-law distribution, the best fitting
mass cut-off and power are $m_{\rm cut} = 0.04\ M_{\odot}$ and $p = -2.1$. Both
mass spectra indicate that a significant fraction of events are caused by
MACHOs in substellar mass range. Both best determined mass functions are
compared with that obtained from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. The
power law is marginally favored ($2.3\sigma$) over the Gaussian mass function,
and significantly over HST mass function ($5.5\sigma$), indicating that MACHOs
have a different mass function from stars in the solar neighborhood. In
addition, the fact that all the models have very poor fits to the longest four
events with $t_{e} \geq 70\ {\rm days}$ remains a puzzle.

community, which I think is a pity. In this paper, I try to summarize the
issues involved and recap current thinking on this topic. My goal is not to
answer this question (I don't think we know enough to be able to do so), but
rather to increase the visibility of this issue in the research community, in
the hope of getting some input and ideas on this very important question. I
conclude with a list of specific research areas I would like to see more work
in, because I think they would increase the `value-added' of NLG over
templates.

$tan\beta$, to the down quark mass matrix. These result in corrections to down
quark masses and to Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa [CKM] matrix elements. The
corrections to CKM matrix elements are the novel feature of this paper. For
grand unified theories with large $\tan\beta$ these corrections may
significantly alter the low energy predictions of four of the CKM matrix
elements and the Jarlskog parameter J, a measure of CP violation. The angles
$\alpha,\: \beta$ and $\gamma$ of the unitarity triangle and the ratio
$|{V_{ub} \over V_{cb}}|$, however, are not corrected to this order. We also
discuss these corrections in the light of recent models for fermion masses.
Here the corrections may be useful in selecting among the various models.
Moreover, if one model fits the data, it will only do so for a particular range
of SUSY parameters.

  astrophysical systems","177 pages (LaTex), figures available by the author",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph nucl-th",,"  The highlights and main results of this work can be summarized as follows :
(1) The energy per nucleon of cold nuclear matter, derived by us using chiral
sigma model, is in good agreement with the preliminary estimates inferred from
heavy-ion collision data in the density range between one to four times the
nuclear saturation density. (2) For a system of high density nuclear matter,
based on the chiral sigma model, we find that a strict first order phase
transition to quark matter is not favoured. This does not, of course, preclude
a phase transition of second order. However, we have not investigated the
latter problem. (3) The mass formulae for finite lumps of strange quark matter
with $u,~d$ and $s$ quarks and non-strange quark matter are derived in a
non-relativistic approach, taking into account the finite size effects such as
surface and curvature. We find that there is a good possibility for the
formation of metastable strangelets of large mass detectable in experiment. (4)
The maximum mass for stable neutron stars predicted by our equation of state
for ($n,~p,~e$) matter is 2.59 times the solar mass. The corresponding radius
($R$), crustal length ($\Delta$) and surface red shift ratio ($\alpha$) are
14.03 $km$, 1.0 $km$ and 0.674 respectively. The maximum moment of inertia is
$4.79 \times 10^{45}~g~cm^{2}$. These suggest that our equation of state for
neutron star matter is comparatively ``stiff"". (5) The neutrino emissivity from
two and three flavour quark matter is numerically calculated and compared with
the result given by Iwamoto. We find that the emissivity is smaller than
Iwamoto's result by about two orders of magnitude when
$p_{f}(u)+p_{f}(e)-p_{f}(d(s))$ is comparable to the temperature. We attribute
this to the severe restriction imposed by momentum conservation on the phase
