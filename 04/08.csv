galaxy NGC 2403 in the CO J=1-0 line. These data emphasize the relatively small
contribution of molecular hydrogen to the cold gas content of this galaxy, and
confirm that the gas surface densities in the inner 2.8 kpc of NGC 2403 lie
below the critical surface density for star formation under the theory proposed
by Kennicutt (1989). Since star formation is occurring throughout the inner
disk, the simple dynamical model used by Kennicutt cannot be the only important
process regulating star formation in galaxies. We suggest that stochastic star
formation processes are responsible for the star formation seen in these
regions, and thus that supercritical gas densities may not be a necessary
condition for star formation in the inner regions of galactic disks.

plays in many of them. In particular it is noted that the constraints on
\OmegaB\ from big bang nucleosynthesis do not overlap with the constraints on
\OmegaVis\ nor have significant overlap with the lower bound on $\Omega$ from
cluster studies. The former implies that the bulk of the baryons are dark and
the later is the principle argument for non-baryonic dark matter. A comparison
with hot x-ray emitting gas in clusters is also made. The lower bound on the
age of the universe from globular cluster ages (hydrogen burning in low mass
stars) and from nucleocosmochronology also illustrates the Hubble constant
requirement $H_0 \le 66 \Hunits$ for $\Omega_0 = 1$\@. It is also noted that
high values of $H_0$ ($\sim 80\Hunits$) even more strongly require the presence
of non-baryonic dark matter. The lower limit on $H_0$ ($\ge 38\Hunits$) from
carbon detonation driven type~Ia supernova constrains long ages and only
marginally allows \OmegaB\ to overlap with \OmegaClus. Diagrams of \HOmega\ for
$\Lambda_0=0$ and $\Lambda_0\neq 0$ are presented to show that the need for
non-baryonic dark matter is independent of $\Lambda$.

point expansion is carried out to one-loop order of perturbation theory.
Dimensional regularization and heat kernel techniques are used to determine the
one-loop divergences. These are partly canceled by the usual renormalizations
of the quark mass and the coupling constant in QCD. An additional divergence
can be absorbed in a multiplicative renormalization of the quark boundary
fields. The corresponding boundary counterterm is a local polynomial in the
