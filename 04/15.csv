of lithium in Pop I and Pop II stars. Large corrections for unseen LiII and for
non-gas phase lithium have provided obstacles to using interstellar data for
abundance determinations. An approach to surmounting these difficulties is
proposed and is applied to the Galaxy and the LMC. The key is that since
potassium and lithium behave similarly regarding ionization and depletion,
their observed ratio (LiI/KI) can be used to probe the abundance and evolution
of lithium. For ten lines-of-sight in the interstellar medium of the Galaxy
(ISM) the Li/K ratio observed $(\log (N_{Li}/N_K)_{ISM} = - 1.88 \pm 0.09)$ is
entirely consistent with the solar system value $(\log (N_{Li}/N_{K})_{\odot} =
- 1.82 \pm 0.05)$. The absence of LiI in front of SN87A in the LMC, coupled
with the observed KI, corresponds to an upper bound (at $\rsim 95 \% \ CL$) of
$\log (N_{Li}/N_K)_{LMC} < - 0.3 + \log (N_{Li}/N_K)_{ISM}.$ This low upper
bound to LMC lithium suggests that cosmic lithium is on its way up from a
primordial abundance lower, by at least a factor of two, than the present Pop I
value of $[Li]_{PopI} \equiv 12 + \log (Li/H)_{PopI} = 3.2 \pm 0.1$.

A401, A1656 (Coma), A2029, A2199, and A2256 to constrain their intrinsic shapes
and baryon fractions. Following Buote & Tsai we probed the aggregate structure
of the clusters on scales $\sim 1.5h^{-1}_{80}$ Mpc to reduce effects of
possible substructure on smaller scales ($\lesssim$ a few hundred kpc). The
ellipticities of the X-ray isophotes are typically $\epsilon\approx 0.15 -
0.25$ and display negative radial gradients significant (except Coma). By
assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and a variety of mass models we obtain
ellipticities $\epsilon_{mass} \approx 0.40-0.55$ for isothermal models of the
total gravitating matter of the clusters; the $\epsilon_{mass}$ constraints
change by $<10%$ upon consideration of the small temperature gradients shown by
ASCA to be typical for rich clusters; the observed X-ray ellipticity gradients
require that mass models with constant ellipticity have steep density profiles,
$\rho\propto r^{-4}$. Estimates of the gas masses are highly insensitive to the
ellipticities of the X-ray isophotes. The clusters in our sample have
increasing fractions of gas mass to total mass with radius and have
$M_{gas}/M_{tot} = (4% - 11%)h^{-3/2}_{80}$ within a radius $1.5h^{-1}_{80}$
Mpc, in excellent agreement with the results of White & Fabian and the Baryon
Catastrophe proposed by White et al. (1993). Finally, the ellipticities of the
dark matter distributions are essentially identical to $\epsilon_{mass}$ and
are consistent with the shapes of dark halos predicted by N-body simulations
and the shapes of the galaxy isopleths in the clusters in contrast to our
previous conclusions using {\it Einstein} data.

In Grant space, which contains nonchronal regions, whether $\left\langle

not depends on the field mass. For a sufficiently large mass $\left\langle
0\left| T_{\mu\nu} \right|0\right\rangle$ remains finite, and the metric
backreaction caused by a massive quantized field may not be large enough to
significantly change the Grant space geometry.

present during inflation. In supergravity models, such a source of
supersymmetry breaking typically makes a contribution to scalar masses of order
${\tilde m}^2 \sim H^2$, where $H^2 \sim V/M_P^2$ is the Hubble parameter
during inflation. We show that in supergravity models which possess a
Heisenberg symmetry, supersymmetry breaking makes no contribution to scalar
masses, leaving supersymmetric flat directions flat at tree-level. One-loop
corrections in general lift the flat directions, but naturally give small
negative squared masses $\sim - g^2 H^2/(4\pi)^2$ for all flat directions that
do not involve the stop. No-scale supergravity of the SU(N,1) type and the
untwisted sectors from orbifold compactifications are special cases of this
general set of models. We point out the importance of the preservation of flat
directions for baryogenesis.
