"alg-geom/9504008","Scott Nollet","Scott Nollet","Integral Subschemes of Codimension Two","26 pages, amstex",,,,"alg-geom math.AC math.AG",,"  In this paper we study the problem of describing the integral subschemes
within a fixed even linkage class $\L$ of subschemes in $\Pn$ of codimension
two. In the case that $\L$ is not the class of arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay
subschemes, we associate to any $X \in \L$ two invariants $\theta_X$ and
$\eta_X$. When taken with the height $h_X$, each of these invariants determines
the location of $X$ in $\L$, thought of as a poset under domination. In terms
of these invariants, necessary conditions are given for integral subschemes.
The necessary conditions are almost sufficient in the sense that if a subscheme
$X$ satisfies the necessary conditions and dominates an integral subscheme $Y$,
then $X$ can be deformed with constant cohomology through subschemes in $\L$ to
an integral subscheme. In particular, if an even linkage class has a minimal
element which is integral, then the conditions are both necessary and
sufficient.

  GRAPE","23 pages, uuencoded postscript file, 2 figures included",,"10.1093/mnras/278.4.1005",,"astro-ph",,"  A combined N--body/SPH code is presented which benefits from the high speed
of the special purpose hardware GRAPE (GRAvity PipE). Besides gravitational
forces, GRAPE also returns the list of neighbours and can, therefore, be used
to speed up the hydrodynamical part, too. After the interaction list has been
passed, density, pressure forces, propagation and interpolation of particles
etc. are calculated on the front end, a 50 MHz SUN SPARC 10. In order to
combine SPH and GRAPE, possible limitations due to the hardware design of GRAPE
are carefully analyzed and modifications compared to current SPH codes are
discussed. The resulting code, GRAPESPH, is similarly flexible as TREESPH. It
seems especially well suited to investigate the formation of individual objects
in a large scale structure environment, like eg. galaxies or clusters. The
total performance is at least half as good as treesph on a CRAY and for most
applications it seems to be even better. The CPU time per time step is only
slightly dependent on the clustering state. GRAPESPH, therefore, provides a
very attractive alternative to the use of supercomputers in cosmology.

  Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1994",,,,"cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  Like many verb-final languages, Germn displays considerable word-order
freedom: there is no syntactic constraint on the ordering of the nominal
arguments of a verb, as long as the verb remains in final position. This effect
is referred to as ``scrambling'', and is interpreted in transformational
frameworks as leftward movement of the arguments. Furthermore, arguments from
an embedded clause may move out of their clause; this effect is referred to as
``long-distance scrambling''. While scrambling has recently received
considerable attention in the syntactic literature, the status of long-distance
scrambling has only rarely been addressed. The reason for this is the
problematic status of the data: not only is long-distance scrambling highly
dependent on pragmatic context, it also is strongly subject to degradation due
to processing constraints. As in the case of center-embedding, it is not
immediately clear whether to assume that observed unacceptability of highly
complex sentences is due to grammatical restrictions, or whether we should
assume that the competence grammar does not place any restrictions on
scrambling (and that, therefore, all such sentences are in fact grammatical),
and the unacceptability of some (or most) of the grammatically possible word
orders is due to processing limitations. In this paper, we will argue for the
second view by presenting a processing model for German.

the $\nu = 1/2$ state using the non-equilibrium Green's function technique. The
lowest order perturbative correction to the self-energy due to the strong gauge
field fluctuations suggests that there is no well defined
Landau-quasi-particle. Therefore, we cannot assume the existence of the
Landau-quasi-particles {\it a priori} in the derivation of the QBE. Using an
alternative formulation, we derive the QBE for the generalized Fermi surface
displacement which corresponds to the local variation of the chemical potential
in momentum space. {}From this QBE, one can understand in a unified fashion the
Fermi-liquid behaviors of the density-density and the current-current
correlation functions at $\nu = 1/2$ (in the long wave length and the low
frequency limits) and the singular behavior of the energy gap obtained from the
finite temperature activation behavior of the compressibility near $\nu = 1/2$.
Implications of these results to the recent experiments are also discussed.

exponentially large domains with different values of the effective
gravitational constant. Such a process can be described by diffusion equations
for the probability of finding a certain value of the inflaton and dilaton
fields in a physical volume of the Universe. For a typical chaotic inflation
potential, the solutions for the probability distribution never become
stationary but grow forever towards larger values of the fields. We show here
that a non-minimal conformal coupling of the inflaton to the curvature scalar,
as well as radiative corrections to the effective potential, may provide a
dynamical cutoff and generate stationary solutions. We also analyze the
possibility of large nonperturbative jumps of the fluctuating inflaton scalar
field, which was recently revealed in the context of the Einstein theory. We
find that in the Brans--Dicke theory the amplitude of such jumps is strongly
suppressed.
