to be narrower at higher energy. If gamma-ray bursts are cosmological, the
energy dependence of gamma-ray burst time scales must be understood in order to
correct the time scale dependence due to the expansion of the universe. By
using the average autocorrelation function and the average pulse width, we show
that the narrowing with energy follows, quite well, a power law. The power law
index is about -0.4. This is the first quantitative relationship between
temporal and spectral structure in gamma-ray bursts. It is unclear what physics
causes this relationship. The average autocorrelation has a universal shape
such that one energy range scales linearly with time into all other energy
ranges. This shape is approximately the sum of two exponential.

have a total extent of about 20 kpc (for $H_0 = 100$ \kms ${\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and
$\Omega_0 = 1.0$) are observed to approximately surround the quasar. One of the
wisps appears to pass through a companion galaxy that is located at a projected
distance of three~kpc from the center of the quasar light. The companion
galaxy, if located at the distance of \pks, has an intrinsic size and
luminosity similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud. A faint extended nebulosity,
which is detected over a region of 35 kpc by 50 kpc and is centered about 5 kpc
from the quasar nucleus, overlaps the wisps. The immediate environment of \pks
is different from the enivronments of the other eight luminous quasars that we
have studied previously with HST. If the multiple light components of the HST
images are fit to a single de~Vaucouleurs profile, as was done in previous
analyses of ground--based data, then the result obtained for the total
luminosity of the model galaxy is in agreement with the earlier ground-based

an adjoint quark to adjoint glue (``gluelumps''). Good scaling behavior is
found for the masses of both magnetic (angular momentum $J=0$) and electric
($J=1$) gluelumps, and the magnetic gluelump is found to be the lowest-lying
state. It is naively expected that the potential for adjoint quarks should
saturate above a separation $R_{\rm scr}$ where it becomes energetically
favorable to produce a pair of gluelumps. We obtain a good estimate of the
naive screening distance $R_{\rm scr}$. However we find little evidence of
saturation in the potential out to separations $R$ of about twice $R_{\rm
