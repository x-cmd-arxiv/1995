spectrum.The standard picture of the matter clustering, the Cold Dark Matter
model (and its variant), assumes that,on scales smaller than a certain
``flattening scale'' $\lambda_f$, the power spectrum increases with the scale,
while on much larger scales it decreases so to match the tiny fluctuations
observed in the microwave background. The standard picture also assumes that,
once a statistically homogeneous sample is reached, the power spectrum
amplitude is fixed, and any major variation should be attributed to luminosity
segregation. However, the determination of $\lambda_f$ and of the absolute
amplitude, if any, is still matter of debate. In particular, there is no
consensus on whether the turnaround has been detected or not, and on the actual
importance of the luminosity segregation effect. We show that, due to the
finiteness of the sample the standard analysis of self-similar (fractal)
distributions yields a turnaround for scales close to the survey scale, and a
systematic amplitude shift with the survey scale. We point out that both
features, bending and scaling, are in agreement with recent determination of
the power spectrum, in particular with the CfA2 spectrum. We remark that the
standard power spectrum is not a well defined statistical tool to characterize
the galaxy distribution when a homogeneity scale has not been reached. In order
to perform an analysis that does not imply any a priori assumption one should
study the PS of the density, rather than the PS of the density contrast.

determine simultaneously the redshift distribution of the faint blue galaxies
and the mass distributions of foreground clusters of galaxies. The method is
based on gravitational lensing and makes use of the following: (1) the
amplitude of lensing-induced distortions of background galaxies increases with
redshift; (2) the surface brightnesses of galaxies decrease steeply with
redshift. The distortions of galaxy images due to lensing are thus expected to
be inversely correlated with surface brightness, allowing us to obtain relative
distances to galaxies as a function of surface brightness. If the redshifts of
the brightest galaxies are measured, then the relative distance scale can be
converted to mean galaxy redshifts as a function of surface brightness.
Further, by comparing the angular sizes of lensed galaxies with those of
similar galaxies in empty control fields, it is possible to break the so-called
mass sheet degeneracy inherent to cluster mass reconstruction techniques which
are based purely on image ellipticities. This allows an unambiguous
determination of the surface density of a lensing cluster. We describe an
iterative algorithm based on these ideas and present numerical simulations
which show that the proposed techniques are feasible with a sample of ~ 10 rich
clusters at moderate redshifts ~ 0.3-0.4 and an equal number of control fields.
The numerical tests show that the method can be used to determine the redshifts
of galaxies with an accuracy of dz ~ 0.1-0.2 at z ~ 1-1.7, and to measure the
masses of lensing clusters to about 5% accuracy.

CKM matrix elements in the standard model, and experiments on the angles

we invoke mixing to a new isosinglet down quark (as in E$_6$) which induces
FCNC that allow a $Z^0$ mediated contribution to $B-\bar B$ mixing and which
brings in new phases. We then repeat the $\chi^2$ analysis, now including
experimental constraints from FCNC as well, finding much larger ranges of
prediction for the $B$ factory. We then add projected $B$ factory results on
$\sin(2\beta)$ and $\sin(2\alpha)$ and repeat both analyses. In $(\rho,\eta)$

find multiple regions that will require experiments on $\sin{(\gamma)}$ and/or

propose a modified algorithm which involves solving the classical equations of
motion for the effective hard thermal loop Hamiltonian with an ultraviolet
