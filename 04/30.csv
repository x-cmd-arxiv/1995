"cmp-lg/9504032",,"Lauri Karttunen, Rank Xerox Research Centre","The Replace Operator","To appear in the Proceedings of ACL-95. 8 pages, PostScript",,,,"cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  This paper introduces to the calculus of regular expressions a replace
operator, ->, and defines a set of replacement expressions that concisely
encode several alternate variations of the operation.
  The basic case is unconditional obligatory replacement:
  UPPER -> LOWER
  Conditional versions of replacement, such as,
  UPPER -> LOWER || LEFT _ RIGHT constrain the operation by left and right
contexts. UPPER, LOWER, LEFT, and RIGHT may be regular expressions of any
complexity.
  Replace expressions denote regular relations. The replace operator is defined
in terms of other regular expression operators using techniques introduced by
Ronald M. Kaplan and Martin Kay in ""Regular Models of Phonological Rule
Systems"" (Computational Linguistics 20:3 331-378. 1994).

effects of inertia (Kramers' problem), in spaces with curvature and torsion.
This is done by invoking the recently discovered generalized equivalence
principle, according to which the equations of motion of a point particle in
such spaces can be obtained from the Newton equation in euclidean space by
means of a nonholonomic mapping. By this principle, the known Langevin equation
in euclidean space goes over into the correct Langevin equation in the Cartan
space. This, in turn, serves to derive the Kubo and Fokker-Planck equations
satisfied by the particle distribution as a function of time in such a space.
The theory can be applied to classical diffusion processes in crystals with
defects.

Chern--Simons Landau--Ginsberg (CSLG) description of the Fractional Quantum
Hall Effect (FQHE) is studied. Beginning with the conventional description of
this model at some chemical potential $\mu_0$ and magnetic field $B$
corresponding to a ``special'' filling fraction $\nu=2\pi\rho/eB=1/n$
($n=1,3,5\cdot \cdot\cdot$) we show that a deviation of $\mu$ in a finite range
around $\mu_0$ does not change the Mean Field solution and thus the mean
density of particles in the model. This result holds not only for the lowest
energy Mean Field solution but for the vortex excitations as well. The vortex
configurations do not depend on $\mu$ in a finite range about $\mu_0$ in this
model. However when $\mu-\mu_0 < \mu_{cr}^-$ (or $\mu-\mu_0>\mu_{cr}^+$) the
lowest energy Mean Field solution describes a condensate of vortices (or
antivortices). We give numerical examples of vortex and antivortex
configurations and discuss the range of $\mu$ and $\nu$ over which the system
of vortices is dilute.

theory when certain subtleties are not taken into account. With the Berry's

integral, the gauge anomalies associated with homotopically nontrivial gauge
transformations are shown explicitly to be eliminated, without any extra
quantum fields introduced. This is in contra-distinction to other quantisations
of `anomalous' gauge theory where extra, new fields are introduced to
explicitly cancel the anomalies.
