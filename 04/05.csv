zero total energy in the vicinity of a Newtonian point mass are characterized
by a single dimensionless parameter, the thickness of incoming flow. In the
limit of thin accretion flows with vanishing thickness, we show that the
governing equations become self-similar, involving no free parameters. We study
numerically thin accretion flows with finite thickness as well as those with
vanishing thickness. Mass elements of the incoming flow enter the computational
regime as thin rings. In the case with finite thickness, after a transient
period of initial adjustment, an almost steady-state accretion shock with a
small oscillation amplitude forms, confirming the previous work by Molteni,
Lanzafame, \& Chakrabarti (1994). The gas in the region of vorticity between
the funnel wall and the accretion shock follows closed streamlines, forming a
torus. This torus, in turn, behaves as an effective barrier to the incoming
flow and supports the accretion shock which reflects the incoming gas away from
the equatorial plane. The postshock flow, which is further accelerated by the
pressure gradient behind the shock, goes through a second shock which then
reflects the flow away from the symmetry axis to form a conical outgoing wind.
As the thickness of the inflowing layer decreases (or if the ratio of the half
thickness to the distance to the funnel wall along the equatorial plan is
smaller than $\sim0.1$), the flow becomes unstable. In the case with vanishing
thickness, the accretion shock formed to stop the incoming flow behind the
funnel wall oscillates quasi-periodically with an amplitude comparable to the
thickness. The structure between the funnel wall and the accretion shock is
destroyed as the shock moves inwards toward the central mass and re-generated

clusters of galaxies (where most of the mass is dark matter) is highly peaked
towards the center, while X-ray observations imply that the gas is more
extended. The additional fact that the gas is cooling in the center has often
led one to expect that the gas temperature should be lower near the center, and
therefore the gas should be more concentrated than the dark matter. We show
that such expectation is not correct, and that the gas temperature must remain
approximately constant within the cooling region in order to have consistency
with the observed X-ray profiles and lenses. A multiphase cooling flow
naturally produces an approximately constant temperature profile, and a more
extended distribution for the gas compared to the mass. Cool phases are
deposited at relatively large radius, while hot phases are adiabatically heated
as they flow inwards and can keep the average temperature constant. Thus,
cooling flows result in an {\it increase} of the central temperature, relative
to a case where there is no cooling and the gas follows the mass distribution.
  The increased central temperatures caused by cooling flows give a
characteristic core radius to the gas profiles, which is of order the cooling
radius. This provides a natural explanation for the typical cores observed in
X-ray clusters. It also brings into better agreement with observations the rate
of cluster evolution expected in self-similar hierarchical models. We propose
that clusters having core radii much larger than their cooling radii are in the
process of merging and are not in dynamical equilibrium.

quite common. Deep optical multi-colour CCD imaging has revealed the presence
of dust lanes and patches, and the technique of co-adding IRAS survey scans has
led to many detections of elliptical galaxies. The optical and far-infrared
surveys reported similar detection rates of dust, which may indicate that dust
in elliptical galaxies is generally distributed in the optically detected lanes
or patches. However, we show here that the amount of dust as derived from the
optical extinction values is typically an order of magnitude smaller than that
derived from the IRAS flux densities, in strong contrast with the situation in
spiral galaxies.
  To unriddle this dilemma, we postulate that the majority of the dust in
elliptical galaxies exists as a diffusely distributed component which is
undetectable using optical methods. Employing a multiple scattering model for
the dust, we show that the presence of this newly postulated dust component
implies significant radial colour gradients which were essentially thought to
arise from stellar population gradients only.
  The energetics of the diffusely distributed dust component is shown to be
consistent with the IRAS data. A comparison of the detectable amount of dust in
elliptical galaxies embedded in hot, X-ray-emitting gas with the amount
expected in case the production and destruction rates of dust are equal
indicates that most of the dust in elliptical galaxies has been accreted from
other galaxies.

unifies these two properties. Hence with the knowledge of the whole MF spectrum
one obtains information on the correlations in space as well as on the mass
function.
  From a theoretical point of view one would like to identify the dynamical
process that leads to such a MF distribution. In order to gain some insight
into this complex problem we have developed a simple stochastic model that
includes some of the basic properties of aggregation process and allows us to
pose a variety of interesting question concerning the possible dynamical origin
of the MF distribution. The dynamics is characterised by some parameters, that
have a direct physical meaning in term of cosmological processes. In this way
we can relate the input parameters of the dynamics to the properties of the
final configuration and produce a sort of phase diagram.

the condition of spherical symmetry about every point, so that the Universe in

dominate, leading to an almost complete suppression of the intra-layer spin
correlation and the breaking of the intra-layer pairs. The ground state with
two holes in this regime has s-like symmetry. The data suggest that the

which commute with these identifications are found. These yield the
supersymmetries for the black hole as found in recent studies as well as the
usual geometric isometries. It is also shown that in the limit of vanishing
cosmological constant, the black hole vacuum becomes a null orbifold, a
solution previously discussed in the context of string theory.

function, mass and coupling constant renormalization are identified and summed
in this approximation. In four dimensions the model fails to have an
interacting continuum limit, but in three dimensions there is a non trivial
fixed point for the approximate RG relations. The critical exponents of the
three dimensional model at this fixed point are $\nu = 0.665069$ and
$\eta=0.19882$. The existence (or non existence) of the fixed point and the
critical exponents display a fairly high degree of universality since they do
not seem to depend on the specific (non universal) assumptions made in the

studied in asymptotically free GUTs and in finite GUTs in curved spacetime,
with explicit examples. The running gravitational coupling is used to calculate
the leading quantum GUT corrections to the Newtonian potential, which turn out
to be of logarithmic form in asymptotically free GUTs. A comparison with the
effective theory for the conformal factor ---where leading quantum corrections
to the Newtonian potential are again logarithmic--- is made. A totally
asymptotically free $O(N)$ GUT with quantum higher derivative gravity is then
constructed, using the technique of introducing renormalization group (RG)
potentials in the space of couplings. RG equations for the cosmological and
gravitational couplings in this theory are derived, and solved numerically,
showing the influence of higher-derivative quantum gravity on the Newtonian
potential. The RG-improved effective gravitational Lagrangian for
asymptotically free massive GUTs is calculated in the strong (almost constant)
curvature regime, and the non-singular De Sitter solution to the quantum
corrected gravitational equations is subsequently discussed. Finally, possible
extensions of the results here obtained are briefly outlined.

quantization of commutative algebras. There is an open problem whether any
Poisson bracket on the polynomial algebra of $n$ variables can be quantized. It
is known (Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem) that any linear P.b. for all $n$ can
be quantized. On the other hand, it is easy to show that in case $n=2$ any P.b.
is quantizable as well. Quadratic P.b. appear as the unitial terms for the
quantization of polynomial algebras as quadratic algebras. The problem of the
quantization of quadratic P.b. is also open. In the paper we show that in case
$n=3$ any quadratic P.b can be quantized. Moreover, the quantization is given
as the quotient algebra of tensor algebra of three variables by relations which
are similar to those in the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem. The proof uses a
classification of all quadratic Poisson brackets of three variables, which we
also give in the paper. In Appendix we give explicit algebraic constructions of
the quantized algebras appeared here to show that they are related to algebras
of global dimension three considered by M.Artin, W.Schelter, J.Tate, and M.Van
Den Bergh from a different point of view.
