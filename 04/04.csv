with interacting artificial cells which have metabolic networks within, and
divide into two when the final product is accumulated. Results of simulations
with coupled chemical networks and division process lead to the following
scenario of the differentiation: Up to some numbers of cells, divisions bring
about almost identical cells with synchronized metabolic oscillations. As the
number is increased the oscillations lose the synchrony, leading to groups of
cells with different phases of oscillations. At later stage this
differentiation is fixed in time, and cells spilt into groups with different
chemical constituents spontaneously, which are transmitted to daughter cells by
cell divisions. Hierarchical differentiation, origin of stem cells, and
anomalous differentiation by transplantations are also discussed with relevance
to real biological experimental results. (Keywords: differentiation, metabolic

photometry during a microlensing event of a giant star can in addition
determine the angular radius of the Einstein ring and the proper motion of the
lens. This possibility results from the fact that the extended atmospheres of
giants emit the cores of resonant lines primarily from a narrow ring (limb
brightening). The radius of the emission ring can be determined to a precision
of 20% by detailed spectroscopic observations of the source after the lensing
event has ended. A considerable fraction of the clump giant stars in the bulge
have a ring radius >10^{12} cm, within the range of Einstein radii for
sub-solar mass lenses. The extended thin ring also provides a sensitive probe
of possible planetary companions as it sweeps across the lens plane. The ring
signature can be detected photometrically, using a narrow-band filter centered
on the CaII K line at 3933 A.

non-Fermi liquid fixed point to infinite coupling where we can apply a
perturbative strong-coupling expansion. The fixed point Hamiltonian involves a
three-body Majorana zero mode whose scattering effects give rise to marginal
self-energies. The compactified model is the N=3 member of a family of ""O(N)""
Kondo models that can be solved by semiclassical methods in the large $N$

mean-field theory generate a fermionic $N$-body bound-state which
asymptotically decouples at low energies. For N=3, our semi-classical methods
fully recover the non-Fermi liquid physics of the original two channel model.
Using the same methods, we find that the corresponding O(3) Kondo lattice model
develops a spin-gap and a gapless band of coherently propagating three-body
bound-states. Its strong-coupling limit offers a rather interesting realization

antimuonium($\mu^- e^+$) conversion in the models which accommodate the
dilepton gauge bosons. The effective Hamiltonian for the conversion due to
dileptons turns out to be in the $(V-A)\times(V+A)$ form and, in consequence,
the conversion probability is rather insensitive to the strength of the
magnetic field. The reduction is less than $20\%$ for up to $B \approx 300$ G
and $33\%$ even in the large $B$ limit.

right-handed neutrinos, without and with left-right symmetry, and with
arbitrary mass terms. We find the conditions which must be satisfied by the
neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices for CP conservation. These
constraints, which are independent of the choice of weak basis, are proven to
be also sufficient in simple cases. This invariant formulation makes apparent
the necessary requirements for CP violation, as well as the size of CP
violating effects. As an example, we show that CP violation can be much larger
in left-right symmetric models than in models with only additional right-handed
neutrinos, {\it i.e.}, without right-handed currents.

the proof that these manifolds provide the analog of superspace for W-gravity

constructing the relationship between the Beltrami differentials which
naturally occur in the higher dimensional manifolds and the Beltrami
differentials which occur in W-gravity. This also resolves an old puzzle
regarding the relationship between KdV flows and W-diffeomorphisms.

backgrounds under consideration include the $2+1$ black hole anti de Sitter
spacetime and its dual, the black string, the ordinary $D\geq 4$ black holes
with or without a cosmological constant, the de Sitter and anti de Sitter
spacetimes and static Robertson-Walker spacetimes. Exact solutions to the
string equations of motion and constraints are obtained in these backgrounds
and their physical properties (length, energy, pressure) are described. The
existence of {\it multi-string} solutions, describing finitely or infinitely
many strings, is shown to be a general feature of spacetimes with a positive or
negative cosmological constant. Furthermore, using a canonical quantization
procedure, we find the string mass spectrum in de Sitter and anti de Sitter
spacetimes. New features as compared to the string spectrum in flat Minkowski
spacetime appear, for instance the {\it fine-structure effect} at all levels
beyond the graviton in both de Sitter and anti de Sitter spacetimes, and the
{\it non-existence} of a Hagedorn temperature in anti de Sitter spacetime.
Finally, we consider the effect of spatial curvature on the string dynamics in
Robertson-Walker spacetimes.
