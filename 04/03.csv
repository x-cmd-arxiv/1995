  hunt@mathematik.uni-kl.de , LaTeX v 2.09",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  In this paper we consider a special class of arithmetic quotients of bounded
symmetric domains which can roughly be described as higher- dimensional
analogues of the Hilbert modular varities. The algebraic groups are defined as
the unitary groups over two-dimensional right vector spaces over a division
algebra with involution. If $d$ denotes the degree of the division algebra,
then $d=1$ is essentially just case giving rise to Hilbert modular varieties.
We determine the class number (number of cusps) of the arithmetic quotients,
and find inter- esting modular subvarities whos existence derives from the
algebraic structure of the division algebras. Also the moduli interpretation,
given by Shimuras theory, is described.

{\rm~ergs~s^{-1}}$ in the central region of 30 Doradus. These two sources
appear point-like in images taken with the {\sl ROSAT} HRI. One of the sources
is most likely associated with a close spectroscopic binary R140a2 (WN6) with
an orbital period of 2.76 days. The mass of the unknown binary component is
likely in the range of $2.4 - 15{\rm~M}_\odot$. This suggests that the X-ray
source could represent a long-sought class of binaries containing a Wolf-Rayet
star and a black hole. The other source, which coincides spatially with Mk34
(WN4.5), may have a similar nature. Available X-ray spectral data support this
Wolf-Rayet + black-hole binary explanation of the two sources. I have used a
{\sl ROSAT} PSPC observation to show that the sources have ultrasoft spectra
with possible intrinsic absorption. Modeled with multicolor blackbody disks,
the spectra provide estimates of the disks' characteristic inner radii, which
are in agreement with those obtained for the known black-hole candidates. An
{\sl ASCA} observation has further revealed a hard X-ray spectral component
from the central 30 Doradus region. This component, represented by a power law
with a photon index of $\sim 2.4$, may belong to the two sources. The
characteristics of both the power-law and ultrasoft components strongly
indicates that the two sources are black-hole candidates in high-mass X-ray
binaries.

properly quantum group commuting with lattice translations. The non-locality
arises from the ordering of factors in the quantum group C*-algebra, and can be
made one-sided, thus allowing semi-local actions on a half chain. Under such
actions, localized quantum group invariant elements remain localized. Hence the
notion of interactions invariant under the quantum group and also under

is no global action of the quantum group. We consider a class of such quantum
