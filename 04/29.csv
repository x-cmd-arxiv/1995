determine the qualitative and quantitative behaviour of a one-basin zonally
averaged thermohaline circulation ocean model. In contrast to earlier studies
which use time stepping to find the steady solutions, the steady state
equations are first solved directly to obtain the multiple equilibria under
identical mixed boundary conditions. This approach is based on the
differentiability of the governing equations and especially the convection
scheme. A linear stability analysis is then performed, in which the normal
modes and corresponding eigenvalues are found for the various equilibrium
states. Resonant periodic solutions superimposed on these states are predicted
for various types of forcing. The results are used to gain insight into the
solutions obtained by Mysak, Stocker and Huang in a previous numerical study in
which the eddy diffusivities were varied in a randomly forced one-basin zonally
averaged model. Resonant stable oscillations with century scale periods are
predicted with structures that compare favorably with those found in the
previous study. In cases with large horizontal diffusivities, the two-cell
pattern is also stable, which parallels cases in the previous study where large
vacillations were seen between the three stable steady states. Further, in
cases with large horizontal {\it and} large vertical diffusivities, no one-cell
pattern can be realised and the only asymptotic behaviour found is the two-cell
pattern.
