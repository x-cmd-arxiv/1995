observations. The spectra are dominated by warm dust emission, which may be fit
with a single temperature in the range 16-21 K (for nu^2 emissivity) along each
line of sight. Dust heated by the attenuated radiation field in molecular
clouds gives rise to intermediate temperature (10-14 K) emission in the inner
Galaxy only. A widespread, very cold component (4-7 K) with optical depth that
is spatially correlated with the warm component is also detected. The cold
component is unlikely to be due to very cold dust shielded from starlight,
because it is present at high latitude. We consider hypotheses that the cold
component is due to enhanced submillimeter emissivity of the dust that gives
rise to the warm component, or that it may be due to very small, large, or
fractal particles. Lack of substantial power above the emission from warm dust
places strong constraints on the amount of cold gas in the Galaxy. The
microwave sky brightness due to interstellar dust is dominated by the cold
component, and its angular variation could limit our ability to discern
primordial fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation.

The saddle-point field configuration is reminiscent of the chiral bag: hedgehog
pions outside a sphere of radius \Lambda^{-1} (\Lambda being the UV cutoff of
the effective theory) matched onto nucleon degrees of freedom for r <

cross-sections data. We obtain to three-loop accuracy: $\overline{m}_s$(1
GeV)=($196.7\pm 29.1$) MeV. By combining this result with the pseudoscalar sum
rule estimate of $(\overline{m}_d +\overline{m}_u)$ and the standard current
algebra values of the light quark mass ratios, we deduce the $average$:
$\overline{m}_d$(1 GeV)=$(10.3\pm 1.5)$ MeV, $\overline{m}_u$(1 GeV)=$(5.0\pm
1.5)$ MeV and $\frac{1}{2}\la \bar uu +\bar dd \ra$ (1 GeV) $ \simeq
-[(228.6\pm 9.1) \mbox{MeV}]^3$. Using also our value of $m_s$, we update the
estimates of the $K'(1.46)$ and $K^*_0(1.43)$ decay constants and of the
(pseudo)scalar two-point correlator subtraction constants. Then, we deduce a
deviation of about 34\% from kaon PCAC and the ratio of the {\it
normal-ordered} condensates: $\la \bar ss \ra /\la \bar uu \ra =
0.68^{+0.15}_{-0.29}$, which confirm previous findings from QCD spectral sum
rules. Finally, using the recent value of the $\overline{m}_b$ from the
$\Upsilon$-sum rules, we deduce the scale independent quark-mass ratio:
$m_b/m_s=34\pm 4$.

Green-Schwarz mechanism is employed to cancel the anomalies, solutions only
exist for a large number of singlets. We find many anomaly-free

with three and four extra singlets do we naturally obtain sfermion masses of

of supersymmetry and the $R$-symmetry in the context of local supersymmetry. In
general the $U(1)_R$ gauge group is broken at or close to the Planck scale. We

\R-symmetry and conserved \R-parity. For conserved \R-symmetry we have models
