$M/\kappa={\bf 1}/\kappa-D$ of the Wilson mass matrix, using QMR, one can carry
out inversions on a {\em whole} trajectory of masses simultaneously, merely at

the computational effort in QMR and BCG by a factor of two. We show that both

standard model which incorporates chaotic inflation and a radiatively generated
intermediate mass scale. Initially a period of chaotic inflation is driven by a
quartic potential associated with the right-handed electron sneutrino.
Supersymmetry relates the quartic coupling of the inflationary potential to the
electron Majorana neutrino Yukawa coupling, $h_1$. The microwave background
temperature anisotropy determines this coupling to be $h_1\simeq 10^{-7}$,
which is similar in magnitude to the electron Dirac Yukawa coupling. A U$(1)$
Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is broken by radiative corrections at an
intermediate scale $\simeq 10^{12}$GeV when the universe cools to a temperature
$T\lesssim 10^3$GeV. This leads to an invisible axion, a weak scale $\mu$-term
and an electron Majorana neutrino mass $M_{N_1}\simeq 10^5$GeV. A second
inflationary period can also occur via a flat-direction field. In this case the
universe can be reheated to a temperature $T_{RH}\simeq 10^6$GeV, without
restoring PQ symmetry. Baryogenesis will then occur via out-of-equilibrium
neutrino decay.
