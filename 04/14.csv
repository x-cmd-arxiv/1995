the power-ratio technique of Buote & Tsai applied to ROSAT PSPC X-ray images.
The clusters exhibit a particularly strong $P_2/P_0 - P_4/P_0$ correlation in
the $1h^{-1}_{80}$ Mpc aperture which may be interpreted as an evolutionary
track; the location of a cluster on the correlation line indicates the
dynamical state of the cluster and the distribution of clusters along this
track measures the rate of formation and evolution of clusters in our sample.
The power ratios anti-correlate with the cooling-flow rate indicating a
reasonable dependence of the flow rate on cluster morphology. The relationship
of the power ratios to the optical Bautz-Morgan (BM) Type is more complex. This
is because the power ratios are sensitive to unrelaxed regions of clusters
within a specified scale, whereas BM types are sensitive to unrelaxed regions
over many scales. We discuss further astrophysical applications exploiting the
relationship between the power ratios and the evolutionary states of clusters.

they enable the largest numbers of particles to be employed. We show that the
functional expansion technique, originally proposed by Clutton-Brock for other
simulation problems, is in fact superior for stability work. For simulations of
linear evolution it is not much slower than grid methods using the same number
of particles, and reproduces analytical results with much greater accuracy.
This success rests on its ability to represent global modes with a modest
number of basis functions; grid methods may be more effective for other
applications, however. Our conclusions are based on implementations of
functional expansion and grid algorithms for disk galaxies.

understood as particle--like, if they behave like free particles. The simplest
solution to the jet clustering conditions leads to a new jet algorithm: a
Lorentz invariant generalization of the JADE algorithm. It is found that this
generalization amplifies hadronization effects in certain phase space regions
in such a way, that hadronization models might become testable in jet physics
