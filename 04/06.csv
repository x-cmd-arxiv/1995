matter, one ``warm'' and the other ``hot''. The hot component is an ordinary
light neutrino with mass $\sim 25h^2$~eV while the warm component is a sterile
neutrino with mass $\sim 700h^2$~eV. The two types of dark matter arise
entirely within the neutrino sector and do not require separate physical
origins. We calculate the linear transfer functions for a representative sample
of warm-plus-hot models. The transfer functions, and results from several
observational tests of structure formation, are compared with those for the
cold-plus-hot models that have been studied extensively in the literature. On
the basis of these tests, we conclude that warm-plus-hot dark matter is
essentially indistinguishable from cold-plus-hot dark matter, and therefore
provides a viable scenario for large scale structure. We demonstrate that a
neutrino mass matrix can be constructed which provides the requisite dark
matter constituents, while remaining consistent with all cosmological bounds.

We calculate the spectrum and the event rate at SK systematically by using the
results of simulations of a supernova explosion and reasonable supernova rates.
We also investigate the effect of a cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, on the
spectrum, since some recent cosmological observations strongly suggest the
existence of $\Lambda$. We find following results. 1) The spectrum has a peak
at about 3 MeV, which is much lower than that of previous estimate ($6 \sim$ 10
MeV). 2) The event rate at SK in the range from 10 MeV to 50 MeV, where the
relic neutrinos from past supernovae is dominant, is about $25 \, {h_{50}}^2 \,
\left( \frac{R_{SN}}{0.1 {\rm yr^{-1}}} \right) \left(\frac{n_G \,
h_{50}^{-3}}{0.02{\rm Mpc}^{-3}}\right)$ events per year, where $R_{SN}$ is the
supernova rate in a galaxy, $n_G$ is the number density of galaxies, and
$h_{50} = H_0 /$ (50km/s/Mpc), where $H_0$ is the Hubble constant. 3) The event
rate is almost insensitive to $\Lambda$. The flux increases in the low energy
side ($< 10$ MeV) with increasing $\Lambda$, but decreases in the high energy
side (10 MeV $<$) in models in which the integrated number of supernovae in one
galaxy is fixed.

Although this signal is background limited, it is observable in some regions

modification of previous analyses necessitated by the observation that those

associated with the $\phi$ meson rectify this problem. The resulting sum rule
fit provides evidence for a significant direct $\omega\rightarrow\pi\pi$

that results for the $q^2$-dependence of the correlator cannot be used to
provide information about the (off-shell) $q^2$-dependence of the off-diagonal
element of the vector meson propagator unless a very specific choice of
interpolating fields for the vector mesons is made. The results for the value

quadrupole moments, in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard
model, in which supersymmetry is broken by soft terms $A_o,\, m_o,\, M_{1/2}$.
Following a renormalization group analysis it is found that the supersymmetric
values of $\Delta k_{\gamma}$ and $\Delta Q_{\gamma}$ can be largely different,
in some cases, from the standard model predictions but of the same order of
magnitude for values of \quad $A_0,m_0,M_{1/2} \leq {\cal O}(1 TeV) $.
Therefore possible supersymmetric structure can be probed provided the accuracy
of measurements for $\Delta k_{\gamma}$, $\Delta Q_{\gamma}$ reaches
$10^{-2}-10^{-3}$ and hence hard to be detected at LEP2. In cases where
$M_{1/2} \ll A_0,m_0 $, the charginos and neutralinos may give substantial
contributions saturating the LEP2 sensitivity limits. This occurs when their
masses $m_{\tilde C},m_{\tilde Z}$ turn out to be both light satisfying
$m_{\tilde C}+m_{\tilde Z} \simeq M_W $. However these extreme cases are
perturbatively untrustworthy and besides unnatural for they occupy a small
region in the parameter space.
