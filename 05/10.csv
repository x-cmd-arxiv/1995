orbital dynamics in a binary system, giving rise to advance (or regression) of
periastron and precession of the orbital plane. We show that these effects are
important in the recently discovered radio pulsar/main sequence star binary
system PSR J0045$-$7319, and can reliably account for the observed peculiar
timing residuals. Precise measurements of the apsidal motion and orbital plane
precession can yield valuable information on the internal structure and
rotation of the star. The detection of orbital precession implies that the spin
of the companion star is not aligned with the orbital angular momentum, and
suggests that the supernova gave the pulsar a kick out of the original orbital
plane. Tidal excitation of g-mode oscillations in the PSR J0045$-$7319 system
induces an orbital period change of order $|\Delta P_{\rm orb}/P_{\rm orb}|\sim
10^{-6}$ at each periastron passage, but the secular trend depends on the
radiative damping time of the g-modes. We also discuss the spin-orbit coupling
effects for the accreting X-ray pulsars and the other known radio pulsar/main
sequence binary, PSR B1259$-$63.

noticeable effects; (3) numerical issues, such as k-range and smoothing are
discussed; (4) short-cut methods, e.g. free-streaming and tilt approximations,

baroque effects are important, such as He recombination and even minimal
reionization; (6) at smaller angular scales there are secondary effects which

subsidiary acoustic peaks and the damping region will be an extremely
challenging problem. However, given the prospect of measuring just such

families of solutions at intermediate accretion rates and no solution for high

dissipating coronae and the second one has coronae which dominate energetically

that such a situation is present in generic systems with many degrees of

Model is reviewed and further explored. Special emphasis is put on questions of
gauge invariance and gauge-parameter (in-)dependence. Owing to the gauge
invariance of the background-field effective action, the vertex functions obey
simple Ward identities which imply important properties of the vertex
functions. Carrying out the renormalization in a way respecting
background-field gauge invariance leads to considerable simplifications. The
generalization of the background-field method to the non-linear realization of
the scalar sector of the Standard Model is illustrated. Furthermore, the
interplay between gauge independence of the S-matrix and Ward identities of
vertex functions is investigated. Finally, the Standard Model contributions to
the $S$, $T$, and $U$ parameters are calculated and discussed within the
background-field method.

the effect of $K^{0}-\bar{K}^{0}$ mixing on $CP$ asymmetries in some weak decay
modes of $D^{\pm}$ and $\stackrel{(-)}{B}$$^{0}_{d}$ mesons. We point out that
a clean signal of $CP$ violation with magnitude of 2Re($\epsilon$) $\approx
3.3\times 10^{-3}$ can manifest in the semileptonic decays $D^{+}\rightarrow
l^{+}\nu^{~}_{l}K_{S}$ ($K_{L}$) vs $D^{-}\rightarrow
l^{-}\bar{\nu}^{~}_{l}K_{S}$ ($K_{L}$). The $CP$ asymmetries are also dominated
by 2Re($\epsilon$) in the two-body nonleptonic decays $D^{\pm} \rightarrow
(\pi^{\pm}, \rho^{\pm}, a^{\pm}_{1})+ (K_{S}, K_{L})$ and in the multi-body
processes $D^{\pm}\rightarrow \pi^{\pm}+n_{0}\pi^{0}+n_{\pm}
(\pi^{\pm}\pi^{\mp})+ (K_{S}, K_{L})$, where $n_{0}$ and $n_{\pm}$ are
integers. It is possible to observe such $CP$-violating signals with about
$10^{7}$ $D^{\pm}$ events at $\tau$-charm factories or hadron machines. Finally
we show that the $CP$ asymmetry induced by Re($\epsilon$) may compete with
those from $B^{0}_{d}-\bar{B}^{0}_{d}$ mixing and final-state interactions in
the semi-inclusive and exclusive decays $B_{d}\rightarrow X(c\bar{c})+(K_{S},
K_{L})$ on the $\Upsilon (4S)$ resonance.

expression of generalized Weyl anomaly of the DS ghost effective action is
found. It is shown that, by a specific choice of the fiber metric $H_h$
depending on the base metric $h$, the effective action reduces into that of a
conformal field theory. Its central charge is computed and found to agree with
that obtained by the methods of hamiltonian reduction and conformal field
theory. The DS holomorphic gauge group and the DS moduli space are defined and
