Caporaso.*
  We prove that Conjecture H of Caporaso et. al. ([CHarM], sec. 6) together
with Lang's conjecture implies the uniformity of rational points on varieties
of general type, as predicted in [CHarM]; a few applications in arithmetic and
geometry are stated.
  Let X be a variety of general type defined over a number field K. It was
conjectured by S. Lang that the set of rational points X(K) is not Zariski
dense in X. In the paper [CHarM] of L. Caporaso, J. Harris and B. Mazur it is
shown that the above conjecture of Lang implies the existence of a uniform
bound on the number of K-rational points of all curves of fixed genus g over K.
  The paper [CHarM] has immediately created a chasm among arithmetic geometers.
This chasm, which often runs right in the middle of the personalities involved,
divides between loyal believers of Lang's conjecture, who marvel in this
powerful implication, and the disbelievers, who try (so far in vain) to use
this implication to derive counterexamples to the conjecture. In this paper we
will attempt to deepen this chasm, using the techniques of [CHarM] and
continuing [aleph], by proving more implications, some of which very strong, of
various conjectures of Lang. Along the way we will often use a conjecture
donned by Caporaso et. al. Conjecture H (see again [CHarM], sec. 6) about
Higher dimensional varieties, which is regarded very plausible among experts of
higher dimensional algebraic geometry. In particular, we will show

randomly distributed in the sky, with no significant concentration to the
galactic plane or to the galactic center. The strong gamma-ray bursts have an
intensity distribution consistent with a number density independent of distance
in Euclidean space. Weak gamma-ray bursts are relatively rare, indicating that
either their number density is reduced at large distances or that the space in
which they are distributed is non-Euclidean. In other words, we appear to be at
the center of a spherical and bounded distribution of bursters. This is
consistent with the distribution of all objects that are known to be at
cosmological distances (like galaxies and quasars), but inconsistent with the
distribution of any objects which are known to be in our galaxy (like stars and
globular clusters). If the bursters are at cosmological distances then the
weakest bursts should be redshifted, i.e. on average their durations should be
longer and their spectra should be softer than the corresponding quantities for
the strong bursts. There is some evidence for both effects in the BATSE data.
  At this time the cosmological distance scale is strongly favored over the
galactic one, but is not proven. A definite proof (or dis-proof) could be
provided with the results of a search for very weak bursts in the Andromeda

  If the bursters are indeed at cosmological distances then they are the most

rescattering does not generate triple product correlations at one loop for

triple-product correlations at the $Z$ are very small, making such measurements

action contains only 1-loop term with the divergent part that can be eliminated

order of the Wronskian used in the derivation. For negatons, the number of
singularities and zeros is finite and they show very interesting time
dependence. The general motion is in the positive $x$ direction, except for
certain negatons which exhibit one oscillation around the origin. In contrast,
there is just one type of positon solution, which we label $[\tilde C^n]$. For
positons, one gets a finite number of singularities for $n$ odd, but an
infinite number for even values of $n$. The general motion of positons is in
the negative $x$ direction with periodic oscillations. Negatons and positons
retain their identities in a scattering process and their phase shifts are
discussed. We obtain a simple explanation of all phase shifts by generalizing

reasons for this and illustrate it by calculating corrections to Maxwell's
equation. The corrections are calculated to cubic order in the field strength,
but are exact to all orders in derivatives. We also test the gauge covariance
of the proper time method by calculating higher (covariant) derivative
corrections to the Yang-Mills equation.

to be equivalent to a natural extension of the standard canonical quantization

of the Born-Jordan rule.

""vacuum polarization"" radiative correction insertion Feynman diagram is carried
out using full, self-consistent Einstein equation propagation of the
intermediate virtual gravitons, which takes into account their important
non-linear interactions with each other. (As a by-product, the subsequent
perturbative treatment of these non-linearities is avoided, which eliminates
the source of the ultraviolet divergences of the second- quantized gravity
theory itself.) The corrected diagram is finite, makes no contribution to
charge renormalization (as could be expected of a diagram involving but a
single transient virtual pair), and its dynamical behaviour accords with the
standard quantum electrodynamics result except at inaccessibly extreme
(Planck-scale-related) values of the momentum transfer. There, the standard
logarithmic rise with momentum transfer which this diagram contributes to the
effective coupling strength falls away, as the diagram proceeds instead to
decrease strongly toward zero. The same self-gravitational correction is made
to the closely related quartically divergent second-order vacuum-to-vacuum
amplitude correction Feynman diagram, and it is found that the result vanishes
identically.

$E$ and compression modulus $K_A$ is made within the energy density formalism
using Skyrme interactions. As compared to the energy expansion, it is found
that, in the pure bulk mode of density vibration, the LDM expansion of $K_A$
shows an anomalous convergence behaviour due to {\it pair \ effect}. A least
squares fit analysis is done to estimate the minimum error, one would expect
even with synthetic data due to the inherent nature of the LDM expansion of
$K_A$ as well as the narrow range of accessible mass number $A$, in the values
of the various coefficients. The dependence of the higher-order coefficients
like curvature and Gauss curvature on the coupling $\beta_c$ between the bulk
and surface parts of the monopole vibrations is analytically studied. It is
shown that the $K_A -$ expansion including the dynamical effect ( $A-$
dependence of $\beta_c$ ) shows an `up-turn' behaviour below mass number about
120, suggesting the inapplicability of the LDM expansion of $K_A$ over this
mass region.
