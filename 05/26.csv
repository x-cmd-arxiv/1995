pairings to each sequence, known as secondary structure. These preimages can be
constructed as random graphs (i.e. the neutral networks associated to the

extension of Eigen's et al. concept of an error threshold in the single peak
landscape. Analogue to the approach of Derrida & Peliti for a of the population
on the neutral network. On the one hand this model of a single shape landscape
allows the derivation of analytical results, on the other hand the concept
gives rise to study various scenarios by means of simulations, e.g. the
interaction of two different networks. It turns out that the intersection of
two sets of compatible sequences (with respect to the pair of secondary
structures) plays a key role in the search for ''fitter'' secondary structures.

suggested that the physical conditions accompanying the formation of a NS may
result in the surface magnetic field of the NS having a low value (~ 10^8 -
10^9 G) while the bulk of the flux is submerged under the stellar surface. The
subsequent growth of the surface magnetic field occurs owing to ohmic diffusion
of a strong internal field (10^12-10^13 G) and proceeds over a time scale of
10^2-10^3 yrs, depending on the early thermal history of the NS, the initial
distribution of magnetic flux and the electrical resistivity in the stellar
crust, as well as on the details of the stellar structure. Referring to this
suggestion, we perform numerical computations to demonstrate its possible
relevance to young radio pulsars. In our calculations, we use different NS
structures based on a model of dense matter presenting a phase transition to
kaon condensation which implies both slow and fast neutrino cooling, depending
on the stellar mass. We present sequences of secular evolution of the surface
magnetic field, spin-down luminosity, spin period, `braking index', and
spin-down age best matching the corresponding measured quantities for PSR
0531+21 (Crab), PSR 0540-69, and PSR 1509-58. We conclude that the effect under
consideration reproduces remarkably well both the observed rotational
characteristics and derived values of the surface magnetic field strength for
these radio pulsars, the only ones having reliable measurements of the braking
indices. In addition, our analysis suggests that the NSs in the Crab and PSR
0540-69 have experienced fast neutrino cooling while the NS in PSR 1509-58 has
undergone slow cooling and hence has a mass below the critical mass.

ordinary particles apart from the difference in critical speed. At speed larger

$\gamma$-ray bursters is examined in the context of a disk origin model and a
halo model of $\gamma$-ray bursters. The conversion formula from a
2-dimensional velocity distribution function to a 3-dimensional distribution
function is derived and applied to reproduce the distribution function of the
kick velocity of radio pulsars. Monte Carlo simulations of the kicked neutron
stars show that the disk neutron star model of $\gamma$-ray bursters still
needs unnatural assumptions if the velocity distribution of the $\gamma$-ray
bursters is the same as that of neutron stars---only neutron stars with very
high kick velocities can become $\gamma$-ray bursters and there are silent
majorities. On the other hand, the core radius of $\gamma$-ray bursters is not
found to be extended by the kick velocity if the core-halo structure similar to
the Galactic dark matter distribution is based on the initial distribution of
the halo neutron stars. Thus the introduction of a kick velocity to neutron
stars do not improve the statistics of neither the disk model nor the halo
model. Two possibilities to save Galactic models are suggested: (1) The
$\gamma-$ray bursters are old neutron stars which were accelerated to
velocities faster than $750~{\rm km\; s^{-1}}$ by jet propulsion and passed the
death line for pulsars due to spin down from the rotational energy loss by jet
ejection. (2) The initial distribution of neutron stars is fairly uniform and
the extent of the halo is large enough for the halo model to be consistent with
the observations. It implies that the initial star formation burst of the
Galaxy occurred fairly uniformly in the extended halo region.

ultraviolet emission is highly polarized (~40\%) with the magnetic vector
aligned roughly with the jet axis, except in the region of the brightest knot

becomes perpendicular to the jet axis. A similar behaviour is seen in the 2cm

ultraviolet--2cm spectral index, depolarization and rotation measure maps. We
identify a region of high depolarization adjacent to Knot A. This is the first
direct observational evidence that indicates the presence of a cloud or
filament of dense thermal material which is mixed with the synchrotron emitting
plasma of the jet. The interaction of the jet with this cloud is likely to be
responsible for the sudden increase in the brightness of the jet at Knot A due
to an induced shock. We suggest that the dark line seen in the 2cm radio data
between Knot A and Knot C could be the shadow or magnetotail of the
depolarizing cloud in the jet.

transitions, using a semiempirical model with the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger type

gap insulator to the metal as the pi-conjugations increase. High pressure
experiments could observe such pressure-induced metal-insulator transitions.

on the SUSY $SO(10)$ theory with $\tan\beta\sim 1$. The inter-family hierarchy
is first generated in a sector of hypothetical superheavy fermions and then
transfered inversely to ordinary quarks and leptons by means of the universal
seesaw mechanism. The Yukawa matrices are simply parametrized by the small
complex coefficients $\eps_{u,d,e}$ which are related by the $SO(10)$ symmetry
properties. Their values are determined by the ratio of the GUT scale
$M_X\simeq 10^{16}$ GeV to a higher (possibly string) scale $M\simeq

of 30 than the scale of the standard $SU(2)\times U(1)$ model. An interesting
aspect of this model is that the sterile neutrinos arise from the hidden mirror
sector of the theory and thus their lightness is more natural than in the usual
neutrino mass scenarios. The needed pattern of the neutrino mass matrix in this
model is obtained by assuming a conserved ZKM-type global lepton number $\bar

string theory compactification on a \cym\ with $(2,2)$ world--sheet
supersymmetry. At the classical level these states (the \sing's of $E_6$)
correspond to the cohomology group $H^1(\M,{\rm End}\>T)$. We examine the first
order contribution of instantons to the mass matrix of these particles. In
principle, these corrections depend on the \K\ parameters $t_i$ through factors
of the form $e^{2\p i t_i}$ and also depend on the complex structure
parameters. For simplicity we consider in greatest detail the quintic threefold
$\cp4[5]$. It follows on general grounds that the total mass is often, and
perhaps always, zero. The contribution of individual instantons is however
nonzero and the contribution of a given instanton may develop poles associated
with instantons coalescing for certain values of the complex structure. This
can happen when the underlying \cym\ is smooth. Hence these poles must cancel
between the coalescing instantons in order that the superpotential be finite.
We examine also the \Y\ couplings involving neutral matter \ysing\ and neutral
and charged fields \ymix, which have been little investigated even though they
are of phenomenological interest. We study the general conditions under which
these couplings vanish classically. We also calculate the first--order
world--sheet instanton correction to these couplings and argue that these also
vanish.

privileged in the sphere $S^D$ case, it is more involved in generic cases. An
interpretation on the validity of the formula is put in terms of the operator
formalism. Operators from this path integral formula are also discussed.

the framework of the Green's function approach. The method provides a very
efficient representation of the single-particle Green's function for a
correlated system. The reliability of this method is established by comparing
its results to those obtained in more elaborate calculations. The sensitivity
of the momentum distribution on the nucleon-nucleon interaction and the nuclear
density is studied. The momentum distributions of nucleons in finite nuclei are
derived from those in nuclear matter using a local-density approximation. These
results are compared to those obtained directly for light nuclei like $^{16}O$.

that limit, which we therefore refer to as the `canonical limit'.) Like with
the Poincar\'e algebra, our deformed Poincar\'e algebra has two Casimir
functions which we associate with `mass' and `spin'. We parametrize the
symplectic leaves of ${\bf R}^4\times SL(2,C)$ with space-time coordinates,
momenta and spin, thereby obtaining realizations of the deformed algebra for
the cases of a spinless and a spinning particle. The formalism can be applied
for finding a one parameter family of canonically inequivalent descriptions of
the photon.
