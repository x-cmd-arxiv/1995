find that with any significant processing, the final D and $^3$He abundances,
which are independent of their initial standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN)
values, rise quickly to a level several orders of magnitude above the
observationally inferred primordial values. Solutions for specific models show
that the only initial abundances that can be photoprocessed into agreement with
observations are those that undergo virtually no processing and are already in
agreement with observation. Thus it is unlikely that this model can work for
any non-trivial case unless an artificial density and/or photon distribution is
invoked.

dominate the energy density of the universe. The field acts as an effective
cosmological constant for several expansion times and then relaxes into a
condensate of coherent non-relativistic bosons. Such a model can reconcile
dynamical estimates of the density parameter, $\Omega_m \sim 0.2$, with a
spatially flat universe, and can yield an expansion age $H_0 t_0 \simeq 1$

our conjecture that these two string theories are equivalent. A feature of the

magnetically charged and dyonic states whose masses also tend to zero, a result
that applies equally to N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. These extra
non-perturbative massless states in the $K_3$ compactification result from
$p$-branes wrapping around collapsed homology two-cycles of $K_3$. Finally, we
show how membrane `wrapping modes' lead to symmetry enhancement in D=11
