matters such as the dependence of Donaldson invariants on the second
Stieffel-Whitney class, are also analyzed.

all the physical curvature invariants are always finite, showing the absence of

the pseudopotential method have been used to study the stoichiometric and
reduced SnO2 (110) surface. The ionic relaxations are found to be moderate for
both the stoichiometric and reduced surfaces, and are very similar to those
found in recent DFT-pseudopotential work on TiO2. Removal of neutral oxygen
leaves two electrons per oxygen on the surface, which are distributed in
channels passing through bridging oxygen sites. The associated electron density
can be attributed to reduction of tin from Sn4+ to Sn2+, but only if the charge
distribution on Sn2+ is recognized to be highly asymmetric. Reduction of the
surface gives rise to a broad distribution of gap states, in qualitative
agreement with spectroscopic measurements.

  the Royal Society of London (Proc.Roy.Soc.A) I will mail the paper's figures
  on request (write to tim.palmer@ecmwf.int)",,,,"quant-ph chao-dyn gr-qc nlin.CD",,"  The conventional view, that Einstein was wrong to believe that quantum
physics is local and deterministic, is challenged. A parametrised model, Q, for
the state vector evolution of spin 1/2 particles during measurement is
developed. Q draws on recent work on so-called riddled basins in dynamical
systems theory, and is local, deterministic, nonlinear and time asymmetric.
Moreover the evolution of the state vector to one of two chaotic attractors
(taken to represent observed spin states) is effectively uncomputable.
Motivation for this model arises from Penrose's speculations about the nature
and role of quantum gravity. Although the evolution of Q's state vector is
uncomputable, the probability that the system will evolve to one of the two
attractors is computable. These probabilities correspond quantitatively to the
statistics of spin 1/2 particles. In an ensemble sense the evolution of the
state vector towards an attractor can be described by a diffusive random walk.
Bell's theorem and a version of the Bell-Kochen_specker quantum entanglement
paradox are discussed. It is shown that proving an inconsistency with locality
demands the existence of definite truth values to certain counterfactual
propositions. In Q these deterministic propositions are physically uncomputable
and no non-algorithmic solution is either known or suspected. Adapting the
mathematical formalist approach, the non-existence of definite truth values to
such counterfactual propositions is posited. No inconsistency with experiment
is found. Hence Q is not necessarily constrained by Bell's inequality.
