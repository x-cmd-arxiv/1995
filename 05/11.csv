renormalized effective potential is found for any value of the curvature and
its asymptotic expansion is given explicitly, both for small and for strong

of some U(2) flavor-like and discrete symmetries is described in detail. %It is
seen explicitly that the effect of a %negative curvature is similar to that of
a magnetic field. The phase diagram in $S^2$ is constructed and it is shown
that, for any value of the coupling constant, a curvature exists above which
chiral symmetry is restored. For the case of $H^2$, chiral symmetry is always
broken. In three dimensions, in the case of positive curvature, $S^3$, it is
seen that some values of the coupling constants lead to a gap equation which
has no solutions. Both for $H^3$ and $S^3$ the configuration given by the
auxiliary fields equated to zero is not a solution of the gap equation.

fraction is studied at finite temperature. An analysis is performed of the
liquid-gas phase transition in a system with two conserved charges (baryon
number and isospin) using the stability conditions on the free energy, the
conservation laws, and Gibbs' criteria for phase equilibrium. For a binary
system with two phases, the coexistence surface (binodal) is two-dimensional.
The Maxwell construction through the phase-separation region is discussed, and
it is shown that the stable configuration can be determined uniquely at every
density. Moreover, because of the greater dimensionality of the binodal
surface, the liquid-gas phase transition is continuous (second order by
Ehrenfest's definition), rather than discontinuous (first order), as in
familiar one-component systems. Using a mean-field equation of state calibrated
to the properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei, various phase-separation
scenarios are considered. The model is then applied to the liquid-gas phase
transition that may occur in the warm, dilute matter produced in energetic
heavy-ion collisions. In asymmetric matter, instabilities that produce a
liquid-gas phase separation arise from fluctuations in the proton concentration
(chemical instability), rather than from fluctuations in the baryon density
(mechanical instability).
