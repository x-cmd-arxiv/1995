jamming of vehicular traffic in cities. Each site of the automaton represents a
crossing where a finite number of cars can wait approaching the crossing from
each of the four directions. The flow of cars obeys realistic traffic rules. We
investigate the dependence of the average velocity of cars on the global
traffic density. At a critical threshold for the density the average velocity
reduces drastically caused by jamming. For the low density regime we provide
analytical results which agree with the numerical results.

  Phys. Rev. B",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.52.13585",,"cond-mat",,"  We determine the magnetic phase diagram for the YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ and
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ systems from various NMR experiments. We discuss the
possible interpretation of NMR and neutron scattering experiments in these
systems in terms of both the non-linear $\sigma$-model of nearly localized
spins and a nearly antiferromagnetic Fermi liquid description of magnetically
coupled quasiparticles. We show for both the 2:1:4 and 1:2:3 systems that bulk
properties, such as the spin susceptibiltiy, and probes at the
antiferromagnetic wavevector $(\pi, \pi)$, such as $^{63}T_1$, the $ ^{63}Cu$
spin relaxation time, both display a crossover at a temperature $T_{cr}$, which
increases linearly with decreasing hole concentration, from a non-universal
regime to a $z=1$ scaling regime characterized by spin pseudogap behavior. We
pursue the consequences of the ansatz that $T_{cr}$ corresponds to a fixed
value of the antiferromagnetic correlation length, $\xi$, and show how this
enables one to extract the magnitude and temperature dependence of $\xi$ from
measurements of $T_1$ alone. We show that like $T_{cr}$, the temperature $T_*$
which marks a crossover at low temperatures from the $z=1$ scaling regime to a
quantum disordered regime, exhibits the same dependence on doping for the 2:1:4
and 1:2:3 systems, and so arrive at a unified description of magnetic behavior
in the cuprates, in which the determining factor is the planar hole
concentration. We apply our quantitative results for YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ to the
recent neutron scattering experiments of Fong {\em et al}, and show that the
spin excitation near $40 meV$ measured by them corresponds to a spin gap
excitation, which is overdamped in the normal state, but becomes visible in the
superconducting state.

reliable predictions for the hadronic matrix elements can be made with
presently available data. We compare the Standard Model predictions with those
of a Two-Higgs doublet model as well as TopColor models, all of which give
distinct signals in this region.
