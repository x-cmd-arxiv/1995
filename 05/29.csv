QCD is studied on the lattice. Using the one-plaquette gauge action and the
Wilson quark action, the transition in the chiral limit is shown to be
continuous for the case of degenerate two flavors, $N_F=2$, while it is of
first order for $N_F \geq 3$. For a more realistic case of massless up and down
quarks and a light strange quark, $N_F=2+1$, clear two state signals are
observed both for $m_s \simeq 150$ and 400 MeV. In contrast to a previous
result with staggered quarks, this suggests a first order transition in the
real world. In order to see the implication of these results to the continuum
limit, we started to study these issues using improved actions. First results
using a RG improved gauge action combined with the standard Wilson quark is
presented for the case of $N_F=2$: With this action the finite temperature
transition is shown to be continuous in the chiral limit confirming the result
of the standard action. Furthermore, not like the case of the standard action
where lattice artifacts make the transition once very strong at intermediate
values of the hopping parameter $K$ on $N_t=4$ and 6 lattices, a smooth
crossover is found for the improved action when we increase $1/K-1/K_c$, in
accord with a naive expectation about the fate of second order chiral
transition at finite $m_q$.

the QCD constraints known so far. We then discuss in detail how the hard gluon

nonperturbative with perturbative effects in the way required by OPE,

affect the shape of the distribution and, thus, can be determined by matching
to the experimental data. The data, still scarce, while not giving precise

of the standard Hilbert and Yang-Mills Lagrangians, but allow for more general
diffeomorphism and gauge invariant actions. The analysis is carried out in all
spacetime dimensions larger than 2 and for all ghost numbers. This covers the
classification of all candidate anomalies, of all consistent deformations of
the action, as well as the computation of the (equivariant) characteristic
cohomology, i.e. the cohomology of the spacetime exterior derivative in the
space of (gauge invariant) local differential forms modulo forms that vanish
on-shell. We show in particular that for a semi-simple Yang-Mills gauge group
the antifield dependence can be entirely removed both from the consistent
deformations of the Lagrangian and from the candidate anomalies. Thus, the
allowed deformations of the action necessarily preserve the gauge structure,
while the only candidate anomalies are those provided by previous works not
dealing with antifields, and by ``topological"" candidate anomalies which are
present only in special spacetime dimensions (6,9,10,13,...). This result no
longer holds in presence of abelian factors where new candidate anomalies and
deformations of the action can be constructed out of the conserved Noether
currents (if any). The Noether currents themselves are shown to be
covariantizable, with a few exceptions discussed as well.

models. It solves the problem of the fractional ghost numbers of Vafa's old
BRST operator and shows how the model is obtained by gauge fixing a zero
action. An essential role is played by the anti-BRST operator,which is given by
one of the supersymmetries of the $N=2$ algebra. Its presence is needed in
proving that the model is indeed a topological field theory. The space of
physical observables, defined by taking the anti-BRST cohomology in the BRST
cohomology groups, is unchanged.

analyses of $\pi$N elastic scattering data with laboratory kinetic energies
below 2.1~GeV. Resonance structures have been extracted using Breit-Wigner
fits, speed plots, and a complex plane mapping of the associated poles and
zeroes. This is the first set of resonance parameters from a VPI analysis
constrained by fixed-t dispersion relations. We have searched our solutions for
structures which may have been missed in our previous analyses, finding
candidates in the $S_{11}$ and $F_{15}$ partial-wave amplitudes. Our results
are compared with those found by the Karlsruhe, Carnegie-Mellon$-$Berkeley, and
Kent State groups.

colour-singlet partition function for massless quarks (with two flavours) and
abelian gluons confined in a bag with a temperature dependent bag pressure
constant $B(T)$. The non-perturbative aspect of QCD interaction is included
through colour-singlet restriction on quark-gluon partition function in a
phenomenological way. The entropy bound inequality $ S/E \ \leq \ 2\pi R/\hbar
c $, where $S, \ E $ and $R$ are entropy, energy and radius, respectively of
the enclosed system with $\hbar c \ = \ 197.331 $ MeVfm, is found to be
consistent with the equilibrium solutions of the baryon mass upto a temperature
$T_E$. There is a region of temperature $T_E < T < T_C$ ($T_C$ is critical
temperature for quark-gluon plasma formation) in which no admissible
equilibrium states exist for the bag. We say that the system expriences a phase
jump from hadron to quark-gluon plasma through thermodynamic non-equlibrium
processes.

finite size strangelets at finite temperature with baryon number $A \leq 100$.
The light quarks $u$ and $d$ are considered massless while mass of the $s$
quark is taken as $150$ MeV. Using discrete eigen energies of the
non-interacting quarks in the bag, grand canonical partition function is
constructed and then the free energy is minimized with respect to the bag
radius. In the $T\rightarrow 0$ limit clear shell structures are found which
persist upto about $T=10$ MeV. Infact for $A=6$ the shell structure disappears
only at $T > 20$ MeV.
