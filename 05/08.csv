(DTL) in general also have FODO lattices. Therefore the natural solution for
the matching between these is a FODO lattice. For matching in all three planes
one then needs sixteen degrees of freedom. However, different requirements,
depending on the applications, may change this solution. For example, in the
production environment (like medical and industrial applications), one needs
fixed current and fixed beam quality. On the other hand, in the research
environment one not only needs all degrees of freedom, but may also want to
chop of beam pulse. This paper discusses matching solutions for these different
requirements.

relationship to Higgs bundles. To a G-principal Higgs bundle on a variety S
corresponds a cameral cover \widetilde{S} of S (a W-Galois cover, where W is
the Weyl group of G) together with a sheaf on \widetilde{S} which in simple
cases is a line bundle, and is W-equivariant up to certain twists and shifts.
Various other types of spectral covers, depending on the choice of a
representation or weight of G, arise as associated objects of \widetilde{S}. We
focus on the decomposition of the Picards of these spectral covers into Pryms
(this includes various well-known Prym identities as special cases) and on the
interpretation, in the spirit of Hitchin's abelianization program, of a
distinguished Prym component as parameter space for higgs bundles.

  presented at the Workshop on ""Astro-Particle Physics"", Ringberg Castle,
  Tegernsee, March 6-10, 1995",,,,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  The neutrino signal from SN~1987A provides an excellent opportunity to
constrain physical theories for matter at extreme conditions and properties of
particles that are produced in supernova (SN) cores. Phase transitions in the
supranuclear equation of state (EOS) may change the cooling history of the
collapsed stellar core and may even lead to a collapse of the protoneutron star
to a black hole on a time scale of several seconds. The implications of such a
scenario for the characteristics of the neutrino emission are tested. Moreover,
the consequences of a reduction of the neutrino opacities by a possible
suppression of the axial-vector interaction in a dense medium (Raffelt and
Seckel 1994) are investigated. Since the strongest constraints from SN~1987A
for the considered theories rely on the signal duration marked by the last
three events in Kamiokande, we also discuss attempts to explain these events
different from the standard protoneutron star cooling scenario. In particular,
attention is focussed on the scenario of a rapid cooling of the protoneutron
star within the time interval of the first 8 Kamiokande events or the IMB
signal which is only about 2--$5\,{\rm s}$. Such a short neutrino emission
could be the consequence of low neutrino opacities or convectively enhanced
neutrino transport. Since the driving force of neutrino heating around the
protoneutron star diminishes, the pressure support of the overlying material
decreases and some matter might fall back to the neutron star. However,
analytical estimates and numerical simulations indicate that the neutrino
emission associated with the accretion of this material is hardly energetic
enough to account for the last bunch of neutrinos at Kamiokande.

through the expectation value of some scalar field (e.g. moduli in supergravity

that of the standard invisible axion, since the initial values of the fields
are usually far away from their true minima, allowing for the color group
becoming strong in the very early universe and fixing the axion field to its
minimum. The effect disappears as soon as scalar field adjusts to its present
value, but the above is enough to ensure that the deviation of the axion
expectation value from the minimum is negligible at the moment of the QCD phase
transition and thus to eliminate the troublesome coherent oscillations. This
may imply that the standard axion window does not necessarily hold in generic
supergravity theories. The above observation may open a natural possibility for

in the second order of perturbation theory in the Lobachevsky space. An
essential ingredient of the used model is the Weinberg's $2(2j+1)$ component
formalism for describing a particle of spin $j$, recently developed
substantially. The boson-boson amplitude is then compared with the two-fermion
amplitude obtained long ago by Skachkov on the ground of the hamiltonian
formulation of quantum field theory on the mass hyperboloid, $p_0^2 -{\bf
p}^2=M^2$, proposed by Kadyshevsky. The parametrization of the amplitudes by
means of the momentum transfer in the Lobachevsky space leads to same spin
structures in the expressions of $T$ matrices for the fermion and the boson
cases. However, certain differences are found. Possible physical applications
are discussed.

E_0(X,M) as a normed linear space. We also build three first countable Eberlein

contains only the constant functions, and E_0(G,M) = C(G,M). If M is the
Hilbert cube or any infinite dimensional Banach space, E_0(H,M) is not all of
