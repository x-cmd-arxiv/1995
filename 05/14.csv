  Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics, February-2-1995",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present CCD phase-binned light curves at 490 nm for 97 Cepheid variable
stars in the bar of the LMC. The photometry was obtained as part of the French
EROS project and has excellent phase coverage, permitting accurate
decomposition into Fourier components. We identify as `sinusoidal' or
s-Cepheids those stars with periods less than 5.5 d and small second-harmonic
components. These stars comprise $\sim$30% of our sample and most form a
sequence $\sim$1 mag brighter than the LMC classical Cepheids in the
period-luminosity diagram. They are also generally bluer and have
lower-amplitude light curves. We infer that the s-Cepheids are first-overtone
pulsators because, when their periods are converted to expected
fundamental-mode values, they obey a common period-luminosity-colour relation
with classical Cepheids. This also confirms the reality of the colour term in
the Cepheid period-luminosity-colour relation. Further, the blue edge of the
classical Cepheid instability strip agrees well with the theoretical
calculations for the fundamental mode made by Chiosi et al. (1993) for the
Hertzsprung-Russell and period-luminosity diagrams, but we find that our
observed s-Cepheids are $>0.2$ mag brighter and bluer than the Chiosi et al.\
predictions for the first-overtone. We identify a number of features in plots
of our stars' Fourier-component amplitude ratios and phase differences. These
features have been identified with resonances between different pulsation
modes. In the LMC we find these features seem to occur at periods very similar
to Galactic ones for classical Cepheids, but at different periods for
s-Cepheids. We discover a double-mode Cepheid in the LMC, for which $P({\rm
first overtone})/P({\rm fundamental}) = 0.710 \pm 0.001$, very similar to
observed ratios for Galactic double-mode Cepheids.

the conversion of polarized muonium, but it gets quenched by a magnetic field

unpolarized muonium is independent of magnetic field. Magnetic fields of 0.1
Tesla or stronger starts to suppress conversion induced by $PP$ interactions in
the lowest Breit-Rabi level, but gets partially compensated by a rise in
conversion probability in the other unpolarized level. The effects of $(S\mp
P)(S\mp P)$ and $(S\mp P)(S\pm P)$ operators behave in the same way as $(V\mp
A)(V\mp A)$ and $(V\mp A)(V\pm A)$ operators, respectively.

to $N_f$ flavors of quarks in the fundamental representation. The quantum
moduli spaces for $N_f < N_c$ are determined completely by imposing
$R$-symmetry, instanton corrections and the proper classical singularity
structure. These curves are verified by residue and weak coupling monodromy
calculations. The quantum moduli spaces for $N_f\geq N_c$ theories are
parameterized and their general structure is worked out using residue
calculations. Global symmetry considerations suggest a complete description of
them. The results are supported by weak coupling monodromy calculations. The
exact metrics on the quantum moduli spaces as well as the exact spectrum of
stable massive states are derived. We find an example of a novel symmetry of a
quantum moduli space: Invariance under the exchange of a moduli parameter and
the bare mass. We apply our method for the construction of the quantum moduli
spaces of vacua of $N=1$ supersymmetric theories in the coulomb phase.

The fixed area partition function is numerically calculated with arbitrary
precision by developing an efficient algorithm for recursively solving the
quintic equations so encountered. An analytic method for studying finite size
effects is developed based on the behaviour of the free energy near its
singular points. The generic form of finite size corrections so obtained are
seen to be quite different from the phenomenological parameterisations used in
the literature. The method of singularities is also applied to study the
magnetic susceptibility. A brief discussion is presented on the implications of
these results to the problem of a reliable determination of string
susceptibility from numerical simulations.

nor flat directions, and hence cannot be studied anywhere in the field space
using holomorphy (``non-calculable''). Some of them are believed to break
supersymmetry dynamically. We propose a simple technique to analyze these
models. Introducing a vector-like field into the model, one finds flat
directions where one can study the dynamics. We unambiguously show that the
supersymmetry is broken when the mass of the vector-like field is small but
finite, and hence Witten index vanishes. If we increase the mass of the
vector-like field, it eventually decouples from the dynamics and the models
reduce to the original non-calculable models. Assuming the continuity of the
Witten index in the parameter space, one can establish the dynamical
supersymmetry breaking in the non-calculable models.
