However, we argue that this is only a lower limit, and conclude that a large
fraction of the gas accreted inside the galaxy could be forming stars. In
addition, the analysis of line-strength gradients in the inner galaxy regions
reveals that, in the mean, they are lower than those of normal ellipticals, and
exhibit a hint of correlation with the mass accretion rate. Simultaneously, the
spectral indices in the outer regions of some galaxies, with and without
cooling flow, attain extremely low values, suggesting that they could be
hosting star formation with an origin not related to the cooling flows.

Han & Gould (1995b) have suggested that they may be due to a kinematically cold

individual events and so to determine their nature, one must measure parallaxes
and proper motions. For long events, parallaxes can be often obtained from
ground-based measurements, but proper motions can only rarely be determined
using conventional methods. Lunar occultations are therefore key to the
understanding of the long events. We carry out realistic simulations to
