brightness (LSB) galaxies. Disney (1976) suggested that the constancy of disk
central surface brightness noticed by Freeman (1970) was not a physical result,
but instead was an artifact of sample selection. Since LSB galaxies do exist,
the pertinent and still controversial issue is if these newly discovered
galaxies constitute a significant percentage of the general galaxy population.
In this paper, we address this issue by determining the space density of
galaxies as a function of disk central surface brightness. Using the physically
reasonable assumption (which is motivated by the data) that central surface
brightness is independent of disk scale length, we arrive at a distribution
which is roughly flat (i.e. approximately equal numbers of galaxies at each
surface brightness) faintwards of the Freeman (1970) value. Brightwards of
this, we find a sharp decline in the distribution which is analogous to the
turn down in the luminosity function at $L^*$. An intrinsically sharply peaked
``Freeman Law'' distribution can be completely ruled out, and no Gaussian
distribution can fit the data. Low surface brightness galaxies (those with
central surface brightnesses fainter than $22~B\sb$) comprise $\gtrsim 1/2$ the
general galaxy population, so a representative sample of galaxies at $z = 0$
does not really exist at present since past surveys have been insensitive to
this component of the general galaxy population.

Abell clusters of galaxies with those predicted using linear perturbation
theory and the 3-D reconstruction algorithm of Branchini \& Plionis (1995) the
value of $\beta$ can be estimated. I show that the anisotropy that causes the
LG motion does not only extend to very large depths ($\sim 160 \; h^{-1}$ Mpc)
but it is also very coherent, which suggests that the value of $\beta \approx
0.21 \pm 0.015$, obtained from the LG velocity, should not be significantly
affected by cosmic variance. Comparing the Abell cluster and QDOT galaxy
dipoles in real space their relative biasing factor are estimated to be
$b_{cI}\approx 3.5\pm0.5$. Finally, using a suitable set of available cluster
peculiar velocities I obtain a somewhat lower value of $\beta\approx 0.15 -
0.17$ but with a large uncertainty ($\gtrsim 0.1$) when weighted by the large

influenced by a steady ``wind shear'' with velocity $\vec v(x,y)=v\,{\rm

For this semi-infinite system, the particle survival probability decays with
time as $t^{-1/4}$, compared to $t^{-1/2}$ in the absence of wind. Scaling
descriptions are developed to elucidate this behavior, as well as the survival
probability within a semi-infinite strip of finite width $|y|<w$ with particle

universal covering su(4). The model can be viewed as an extension of the linear
$\sigma$ model with SO(6) symmetry in place of SO(4) and generalizes the

that the vector representation of SU(4) reduces on the SO(4) level to a

$\sigma$ model with a hedgehog configuration for the pion field, whereas the
imaginary part describes vector meson degrees of freedom via purely transversal
