We concentrate on a set whose zeroth order functions describe the perfect

be shown to be complete in a weak sense. Poisson's equation can be solved
approximately by truncating the expansion of the potential in such a set. A
simple example of a potential which is not one of the basis functions is
expanded using the symmetric members of the basis set up to fourth order. The

that the disk luminosity function (LF) drops sharply for M_V>12 (M<0.25 \ms),
decreasing by a factor \gsim 3 by M_V~14 (M~0.14\ms). This decrease in the LF
is in good agreement with the ground-based photometric study of nearby stars by
Stobie et al. (1989), and in mild conflict with the most recent LF measurements
based on local parallax stars by Reid et al. (1995). The local LF of the faint
Galactic disk stars can be transformed into a local mass function using an
empirical mass-M_V relation. The mass function can be represented analytically
over the mass range 0.1\ms<M<1.6\ms by \log(\phi)=-1.35-1.34\log(M/\ms)-1.85
[\log(M/\ms)]^2 where \phi is the number density per logarithmic unit of mass.
The total column density of M stars is only \Sigma_M=11.8\pm 1.8\ms\pc^{-2},
implying a total `observed' disk column density of \Sigma_\obs~=39\ms\pc^{-2},
lower than previously believed, and also lower than all estimates with which we
are familiar of the dynamically inferred mass of the disk. The measured scale
length for the M-star disk is 3.0\pm 0.4 kpc. The optical depth to microlensing
toward the LMC by the observed stars in the Milky Way disk is \tau~1x10^{-8},
compared to the observed optical depth found in ongoing experiments \tau_\obs~
10^{-7}. The M-stars show evidence for a population with characteristics
intermediate between thin disk and spheroid populations. Approximating what may
be a continuum of populations by two separate component, we find characteristic
exponential scale heights of ~210 pc and ~740 pc.

the perigalactic distances P of well-observed Galactic globulars that do not

correlates somewhat more strongly with P than it does with the present
Galactocentric distances R of globular clusters. It is also found that both P
and R correlate more strongly with the cluster half-light radii rh than they do
with [Fe/H]. This suggests that cluster radii are mainly determined by global
parameters of the (proto)Galaxy, whereas [Fe/H] may have been more strongly
affected by local evolutionary effects. The strong correlation (P) = 0.70 +/-
0.05 between the perigalactic distances and half-light radii of globular
clusters is particularly striking. The half-light radii rh of globular clusters
in the outer halo of the Galaxy are found to correlate with R, and even more
strongly with P. It is not yet clear how this result is to be reconciled with
the Searle-Zinn scenario for the formation of the outer halo of the Galaxy. The

over-estimated, resulting in perigalactic distances that are too large. Halo

Chandrasekhar--mass CO white dwarf (WD) with a CO WD companion, explosion of a
sub--Chandrasekhar mass CO WD induced by accretion of material from a He star
companion, and explosion of a sub--Chandrasekhar CO WD in a symbiotic system.
The variation of the SNe Ia rate and explosion characteristics with time is
derived, and its correlation with parent population age and galaxy redshift is
discussed. Among current scenarios, CO + He star systems should be absent from
E galaxies. Explosion of CO WDs in symbiotic systems could account for the SNe
Ia rate in these galaxies. The same might be true for the CO + CO WD scenario,
depending on the value of the common envelope parameter. A testable prediction
of the sub--Chandrasekhar WD model is that the average brightness and kinetic
energy of the SN Ia events should increase with redshift for a given Hubble
type. Also for this scenario, going along the Hubble sequence from E to Sc
galaxies SNe Ia events should be brighter on average and should show larger
mean velocities of the ejecta. The observational correlations strongly suggest
that the characteristics of the SNe Ia explosion are linked to parent
population age. The scenario in which WDs with masses below the Chandrasekhar
mass explode appears the most promising one to explain the observed variation
of the SN Ia rate with galaxy type together with the luminosity--expansion
velocity trend.

sequence mass in the range of about $18 - 30 M_{\odot}$ explode, returning
matter to the Galaxy, and then go into low-mass ($\geq 1.5 M_{\odot}$) black
holes. Even more massive main-sequence stars would, presumably, chiefly g o
into high-mass ($\sim 10 M_{\odot}$) black holes. The Brown-Bethe estimates
gave approximately $5 \times {10}^{8}$ low-mass black holes in the Galaxy. A
pressing question, which we attempt to answer here, is why, with the possible
exception of the compact objects in SN1987A and 4U\,1700--37, none of these
have been seen.
  We address this question in three parts. Firstly, black holes are generally
``seen'' only in binaries, by the accretion of matter from a companion star.
High mass black holes are capable of accreting more matter than low-mass black
holes, so there is a selection effect favoring them. This, in itself, would not
be sufficient to show why low-mass black holes have not been seen, since
neutron stars (of nearly the same mass) are seen in abundance.
  Secondly, and this is our main point, the primary star in a binary ---the
first star to evolve--- loses its hydrogen envelope by transfer of matter to
the secondary and loss into space, and the resulting ``naked'' helium star
evolves differently than a helium core, which is at least initially covered by
the hydrogen envelope in a massive main-sequence star. We show that primary
stars in binaries can end up as neutron stars even if their initial mass
substantially exceeds the mass limit for neutron star formation from single
stars ($\sim 18 M_{\odot}$). An example is 4U\,1223--62, in which we suggest
that the initial primary mass exceeded $35 M_{\odot}$, yet X-ray pulsations

the generalized hodograph solutions of the dKP hierarchy, which show that all
