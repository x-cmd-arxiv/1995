considerations, the use of a well adapted moving grid and a well adapted moving

hydrodynamical equations are written in a moving frame which mimics the bulk of
the movement of the fluid, resulting in very small relative velocities and a
well suited spatial resolution throughout the calculations. Therefore, the
numerical calculations are considerably simplified, smoothing in particular the
Courant condition. Typical runs are performed within a few hours on a

one-parameter family of WDM models. The linear power spectra for these models
is calculated and compared with the corresponding spectra for cold dark matter
(CDM), hot dark matter (HDM) and mixed dark matter (MDM) as well as the power
spectrum derived from observations. Our linear analyses suggest that a model
universe dominated by a particle whose mass to temperature ratio $m_x/T_x$ is
increased by a factor of two as compared with the standard HDM neutrino gives a
reasonable fit to the data on large $(>8h^{-1} {\rm ~Mpc})$ scales. $N$-body
simulations for this particular WDM model show features of both HDM and CDM. As
in HDM, the first objects to collapse are large pancake-like structures. The
final matter distribution is rather smooth and structures as small as galaxy
halos are excluded. However, there appear to be virialized rich clusters
evident in the CDM but not the HDM simulations. Unfortunately, a simple
comparison of the matter distribution and its statistical properties with
observations indicates that WDM, like CDM, has too much power at small scales.
This is particularly evident in the small-scale pairwize velocity dispersion.
The cluster multiplicity function has the wrong shape with too many rich
clusters being produced, though this conclusion is based on the simple
assumption that light traces mass in groups of galaxies.

of 0.5 - 1, on the scale of 0.5 - 3 h^{-1} Mpc (comoving), or 100 - 600 km/s,

anticorrelation on the scale of 3 - 6 h^{-1} Mpc. The strength of the positive
correlations is comparable to that predicted from the primordial power spectrum
inferred from optically-selected galaxy redshift surveys. If the
anticorrelations are physical, it becomes unclear whether the detected
clustering is consistent with current models of structure formation with a
homogeneous photoionizing UV metagalactic background. Instead, the
anti-clustering may require inhomogeneity in the UV background, and possibly in

sound even when this frequency is removed from the stimulus is an interesting
phenomenon related to the pitch of complex sounds. This capability is known as
``residue'' or ``virtual pitch'' perception and was first reported last century
in the pioneering work of Seebeck. It is residue perception that allows one to
listen to music with small transistor radios, which in general have a very poor
and sometimes negligible response to low frequencies. The first attempt, due to
Helmholtz, to explain the residue as a nonlinear effect in the ear considered
it to originate from difference combination tones. However, later experiments
have shown that the residue does not coincide with a difference combination
tone. These results and the fact that dichotically presented signals also
elicit residue perception have led to nonlinear theories being gradually
abandoned in favour of central processor models. In this paper we use recent
results from the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems to show that physical
frequencies produced by generic nonlinear oscillators acted upon by two
independent periodic excitations can reproduce with great precision most of the
experimental data about the residue without resorting to any kind of central
processing mechanism.

peak appears in the static structure factor $S(q)$ for low filling fractions $f

by generalizing to non-diagonal hardness matrices, thereby allowing us to test
for transferability to non-spherically symmetric environments. We apply the
method to study the transferability of norm-conserving pseudopotentials for a
variety of elements in the Periodic Table. We find that the self-consistent
corrections are frequently significant, and should not be neglected. We prove
that the partial-core correction improves the pseudopotential hardness of
alkali metals considerably. We propose a quantity to represent the average

a function of pseudopotential cutoff radii. We find that the atomic
polarizabilities are usually well reproduced by the norm-conserving
pseudopotentials. Our results provide useful guidelines for making optimal
choices in the pseudopotential generation procedure.

by using a $\Sigma$ nucleus optical potential constructed within the
relativistic mean field approach. The analysis leads to potentials with a
repulsive real part in the nuclear interior. The data are sufficient to
establish the size of the isovector meson--hyperon coupling. Implications to
$\Sigma$ hypernuclei are discussed.

nuclear collisions and their role in signalling quark-gluon plasma formation.
We report on new insights into the formation mechanisms of strange particles
during ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions and discuss interesting new
details of the strangeness phase diagram. In the main part of the review we
show how the measured (multi-)strange particle abundances can be used as a
testing ground for chemical equilibration in nuclear collisions, and how the
results of such an analysis lead to important constraints on the collision
dynamics and space-time evolution of high energy heavy-ion reactions.
