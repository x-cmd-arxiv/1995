To appear in ICGA-95",,,,"adap-org nlin.AO",,"  This paper extends previous work done by Tanese on the distributed genetic
algorithm (DGA). Tanese found that the DGA outperformed the canonical serial
genetic algorithm (CGA) on a class of difficult, randomly-generated Walsh
polynomials. This left open the question of whether the DGA would have similar
success on functions that were more amenable to optimization by the CGA. In
this work, experiments were done to compare the DGA's performance on the Royal
Road class of fitness functions to that of the CGA. Besides achieving
superlinear speedup on KSR parallel computers, the DGA again outperformed the
CGA on the functions R3 and R4 with regard to the metrics of best fitness,
average fitness, and number of times the optimum was reached. Its performance
on R1 and R2 was comparable to that of the CGA. The effect of varying the DGA's
migration parameters was also investigated. The results of the experiments are
presented and discussed, and suggestions for future research are made.

based upon an assemblage of randomly overlapped, strongly absorbing, pressure
broadened lines, is compared to detailed radiative transfer calculations of the

accurate to within ~ 1.2 K. Similar levels of accuracy are found when the model
is compared to detailed calculations of the middle (7.3 micron) and lower (8.3
micron) tropospheric water vapor radiance, provided that the emission from the
underlying surface is taken into account. Based upon these results, the RSL
model is used to interpret TOVS-observed water vapor radiances in terms of the
relative humidity averaged over deep layers of the upper, middle, and lower
troposphere. We then present near-global maps of the geographic distribution

from TOVS for the period 1981-1991. These maps clearly depict the role of

$\epsilon(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{-1.5}$. Such a dependence has been observed

explain the observed structures, the center of the source must much more highly
magnified than its outer regions. Lensing predicts a small counterimage to the
arc, which we find adjacent to the lensing galaxy. A red component in the
observed spectrum suggests a lens redshift of unity, and the lens model yields
a mass estimate of $M(r<3kpc)\approx10^{11}{M_solar}$, consistent with an
ordinary elliptical galaxy. We present new high-resolution optical images which
show a thin arc of emission, implying an intrinsically small source ($<0.5kpc$)
which is highly magnified ($\sim20\times$). Since the optical is strongly
polarized with a Seyfert~II spectrum, we propose that the optical arc is
magnified image of the inner region of an obscured AGN. The obscuring ``torus''
will be similarly magnified, naturally accounting for the large IR flux. We
show that finding objects like F10214+4724 in redshift surveys is probable,

minimal extension of the Standard Model based on the quark-lepton symmetry
$SU(4)_V \otimes SU(2)_L \otimes G_R$ of the Pati-Salam type. Given this
symmetry the third type of mixing in the interactions ot the $SU(4)_V$
leptoquarks with quarks and leptons is shown to be required. An additional
arbitrariness of the mixing parameters could allow, in principle, to decrease
noticeably the lower bound on the vector leptoquark mass originated from the
low-energy rare processes. The decays $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$, $\mu
\rightarrow e \gamma \gamma$, and $\mu \rightarrow e e \bar e$ via the vector
leptoquark are analysed and the specific hierarchy of the decay probabilities
$\Gamma(\mu \rightarrow e e \bar e) \gg \Gamma(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma \gamma)
\gg \Gamma(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma)$ is shown to exist. The upper limits on
the branching ratios at a level of $10^{-18}$ for the $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma
\gamma$ decay and at a level of $10^{-15}$ for the $\mu \rightarrow e e \bar e$
decay are established.

photons. We show that the former dominates strongly below $x\simeq 0.01$, and
the latter above this value. This fact makes $F_2^{\gamma}({\rm charm})$ for $x
\geq 0.01$ calculable, whereas for $x \leq 0.01$ it serves to constrain the
small-$x$ gluon density in the photon. Both ranges in $x$ are accessible at
LEP2. Theoretical uncertainties are well under control. We present rates for
single-tag events for the process for $e^+e^- \rightarrow e^+e^- c X$ for LEP2.
Although these event rates are small, we believe a measurement of
$F_2^{\gamma}({\rm charm})$ is feasible.

Explicitly shown is the fact that a uniform acceleration stabilizes certain

close inspection of the geometry reveals that this is possible only for
near-extremal black holes and that most nonextremal varieties continue to
evaporate with a modified spectrum under the acceleration. We also introduce a
two-dimensional toy model where the energy-momentum flow is easily obtained for
general accelerations, and find the behavior to be in accordance with the
four-dimensional results. After a brief comparison to the classical system of a
uniformly accelerated charge, we close by pointing out the importance of this
result in the WKB expansion of the black hole pair-creation rate.

more involved example of a particle in a magnetic field. In each case, edge

conditions. Second quantization of these quantum mechanical systems leads to a
multi-particle ground state carrying a persistent current at the edge. We show
that the theory quantized with this vacuum displays an ``anomaly'' at the edge

external magnetic field. We also offer interpretations for the physics of such
boundary conditions which may have a bearing on the nature of the excitations
