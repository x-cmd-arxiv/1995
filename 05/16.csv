  Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 5-Jan-1995",,"10.1093/mnras/274.4.1029",,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  An improved formula for the timing of binary pulsars that accounts for the
relativistic deflection of light in the gravitational field of the pulsar's
companion is presented, and the measurability of this effect together with its
variance estimates are discussed. The deflection of the pulsar's beam
trajectory in the gravitational field of its companion leads to variation in
the pulsar's rotational phase. This variation appears as the narrow sharp
growth of the magnitude of the post-fit pulsar timing residuals in the vicinity
of the moment of the superior conjunction of the pulsar with its companion. In
contrast to the relativistic Shapiro effect the amplitude of the effect of
gravitational deflection of the pulsar radio beam has two peaks with opposite
signs, which become sharper as the inclination $i$ of the pulsar's orbit
approaches 90$^{\circ}$. The effect under consideration influences the
estimation of parameters of the relativistic Shapiro effect in the binary
pulsars with nearly edgewise orbits. Its inclusion in the fitting procedure
provide more careful measurement of sine of the orbital inclination $i$ as well
as the masses of the pulsar $m_p$ and its companion $m_c$. This permits an
improved testing of alternative theories of gravity in the strong field regime.
Moreover, the measurement of this effect permits independent geometric
constraints on the position of the pulsar rotational axis in space. The effect
of the gravitational deflection of light has been numerically investigated for
binary pulsars with nearly edgewise orbits. It is shown that the effect is
observed in general only when $\cos i\leq 0.003.$ This estimate becomes less
restrictive as the pulsar's spin axis approaches the line of the sight.

loops are generated by numerically evolving parent loops with different initial
conditions forward in time until they self-intersect, fragmenting into two
child loops. The fragmentation of the child loops is followed recursively until
only non-self-intersecting loops remain. The properties of the final
non-self-intersecting loops are found to be independent of the initial
conditions of the parent loops. We have calculated the radiated energy and
momentum for a total of 11,625 stable child loops. We find that the majority of
the final loops do not radiate significant amounts of spatial momentum. The
velocity gained due to the rocket effect is typically small compared to the
center-of-mass velocity of the fragmented loops. The distribution of
gravitational radiation rates in the center of mass frame of the loops,
$\gamma^0 \equiv (G\mu^2)^{-1} \Delta E/\Delta \tau$, is strongly peaked in the
range $\gamma^0=45-55$, however there are no loops found with $\gamma^0 < 40$.
Because the radiated spatial momentum is small, the distribution of
gravitational radiation rates appears roughly the same in any reference frame.
We conjecture that in the center-of-mass frame there is a lower bound
$\gamma^0_{\rm min}>0$ for the radiation rate from cosmic string loops. In a
second conjecture, we identify a candidate for the loop with the minimal
radiation rate and suggest that $\gamma^0_{\rm min}\cong 39.003$.

V=\oplus_i^n I_i$, define $n$ quadratic algebras $(V, J_m)$ where
$J_m=\oplus_{i\neq m} I_i$. This decomposition defines also the quantum
semigroup $M(V;I_1,...,I_n)$ which acts on all these quadratic algebras. With
the decomposition we associate a family of associative algebras
$A_k=A_k(I_1,...I_n)$, $k\geq 2$. In the classical case, when $V\otimes V$
decomposes into the symmetric and skewsymmetric tensors, $A_k$ coincides with
the group algebra of the symmetric group $S_k$. Let $I_{ih}$ be deformations of
the subspaces $I_i$. In the paper we give a criteria for flatness of the
corresponding deformations of the quadratic algebras $(V[[h]],J_{ih}$ and the
quantum semigroup $M(V[[h]];I_{1h},...,I_{nh})$. It says that the deformations
will be flat if the algebras $A_k(I_1,...,I_n)$ are semisimple and under the
deformation their dimension does not change.
  Usually, the decomposition into $I_i$ is defined by a given Yang-Baxter
operator $S$ on $V\otimes V$, for which $I_i$ are its eigensubspaces, and the
deformations $I_{ih}$ are defined by a deformation $S_h$ of $S$. We consider
the cases when $S_h$ is a deformation of Hecke or Birman-Wenzl symmetry, and
also the case when $S_h$ is the Yang-Baxter operator which appears by a
representation of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group. Applying the flatness
criteria we prove that in all these cases we obtain flat deformations of the
