coupled to the minimal standard model of particle physics. The non-minimal
coupling parameter between gravity and the Higgs field must then be very large,
yielding some new cosmological consequences for the early Universe and new
constraints on the Higgs mass. As an outcome, new inflation is only possible
for very special initial conditions producing first a short contraction era
after which an inflationary expansion automatically follows; a chaotic
inflationary scenario is successfully achieved. The contrast of density
perturbations required to explain the seed of astronomic structures are
obtained for very large values of the Higgs mass ($M_{H} >> G_{F}^{-1/2}$),
otherwise the perturbations have a small amplitude; in any case, the spectral
index of scalar perturbations agrees with the observed one.

radial velocities from these spectra, as well as from high-resolution IUE

strong deviations from a pure Keplerian radial-velocity curve, which are
autocorrelated within one night, but not from one night to another. Since lines
of different ions exhibit very similar changes in profile, these deviations
most likely reflect large-scale motions of the stellar surface akin to
non-radial pulsations. A possible cause could be that the varying tidal force
exerted by the neutron star in its eccentric orbit excites high-order pulsation
modes in the optical star which interfere constructively for short time
intervals. The effect of such velocity excursions on the orbital solution is
estimated by means of a Monte-Carlo simulation technique. We investigate
sources of systematic error, due to, e.g., the tidal deformation of the star,
and find, in particular, evidence for a systematic perturbation of the radial
velocity near the time of velocity minimum. This possible distortion severely
compromises the accuracy of the radial-velocity amplitude, leading to a 95\%

The model is inspired by the magneto-hydrodynamic approach of Camenzind (1986),

the radio core. Simultaneous conservation of three out of four physical
parameters is used to derive analytic solutions for the equation of motion of
the idealized jet features. These are the jet's kinetic energy, angular
momentum, and momentum along the jet axis. Conservation of angular momentum is
required to fit the observed trajectories at distances larger than 3
milliarcsec, in agreement with the kinematic predictions of Camenzind's model.
The best-fit model variant preserves angular momentum, kinetic energy, and
opening angle, with an inclination of the jet axis to the line of sight 6.8
degrees, an opening angle 0.95 degrees, and Lorentz factors 5.8 and 4.6 for

turbulent small-scale motion of the jet components, and it does not take into

QSOs above a given magnitude threshold and thereby enhances the probability for
observing damped absorption systems. Second, the bending of light rays from the
source effectively limits the minimum impact parameter of the line-of-sight
relative to the center of the absorber, thus providing an upper cut-off to the
observed neutral hydrogen (HI) column density. The combination of these effects
yields a pronounced peak in the observed abundance of absorbers with high
column densities (>2*10^{21} cm^{-2}) and low redshifts (z<1). The inferred
value of the cosmological density parameter of neutral hydrogen, Omega_{HI},
increases with increasing redshift and luminosity of the sources even if the
true HI density remains constant. This trend resembles the observed evolution
of Omega_{HI}(z). Damped Lyman-alpha absorbers with column densities >10^{21}
cm^{-2} and redshifts 0.5<z<1 are reliable flags for lensed QSOs with a close

find that the metallicity resulting from this hypothesis is adequate only for

occur much earlier than those from ellipticals, due to the smaller binding
energy of the gas, we show that the gas ejected by dwarf galaxies is enriched
mostly by Type II supernovae, as opposed to Type I supernovae in the case of
large galaxies. We further point out that the gas in small scale structures,
which never cools and forms stars due to low temperatures and, consequently,
large cooling time scale, gets dispersed in the process of hierarchical
clustering, and is incorporated as the diffuse intracluster gas. We show that
this process can provide enough hot gas to be compatible with X-ray

that the emission of pre-equilibrium particles and mixing of events from
different classes cannot be ignored in the analysis of nuclear fragmentation

compatible with its higher symmetries is considered. It is demonstrated that
this problem is reduced to finding of the differential constraints consistent
with the ZS-AKNS hierarchy. A method of their construction is offered based on
the B\""acklund transformations. It is shown that the generalized Toda lattices
corresponding to the non-exceptional Lie algebras of finite growth can be
obtained by imposing one of the four simplest integrable boundary conditions on
the both ends of the lattice. This fact allows, in particular, to solve the
problem of reduction of the series $A$ Toda lattices into the series $D$ ones.
Deformations of the found boundary conditions are presented which leads to the
Painlev\'e type equations.
