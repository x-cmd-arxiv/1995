mapped this cloud in J=1${\rightarrow}$0 transitions of $^{12}$CO and
$^{13}$CO. It is found that the distribution of the emission in the line {\it
wings} show clear evidence for substantial mass motions. Also, the ``virial''
mass of the cloud is found to be five times the actual cloud mass determined
from the $^{13}$CO column density map. It is argued that this cloud has
abnormally high star formation efficiency and is possibly disintegrating. The

the star ${\epsilon}$ Orionis which is also possibly responsible for the

that the combination of perturbative and nonperturbative contributions be

section. This is at the level $1/Q$ for the thrust distribution and Drell-Yan
process, and $1/m^2$ for B decay. We discuss the universality of $1/Q$
