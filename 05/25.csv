$\Delta$ inherits the Zariski topology from $X$. In this article some
cohomological invariants of $X$ are studied in terms of whether or not they
depend only on $\Delta$ and not $k$. Secondly some numerical invariants of $X$
are studied in terms of whether or not they are topological invariants of the
fan $\Delta$. That is, whether or not they depend only on the finite
topological space defined on $\Delta$. The invariants with which we are mostly
concerned are the class group of Weil divisors, the Picard group, the Brauer
group and the dimensions of the torsion free part of the \'etale cohomology
groups with coefficients in the sheaf of units. The notion of an open
neighborhood of a fan is introduced and examples are given for which the above

properties and spatial distribution of bright giants near the centers of the
core-collapsed globular clusters NGC5946 and NGC7099. The former cluster is
located at a low Galactic latitude and is heavily reddened; nevertheless, the
K, J-K color-magnitude diagram (CMD) shows a well-defined giant branch, with a
width +/- 0.05 magnitudes in J-K. Most of the observed width is due to
differential reddening. The upper giant branch is relatively steep, and
comparisons with less reddened clusters indicate that (1) NGC5946 must be very
metal-poor, with [Fe/H] ~ -2, and (2) E(B-V) ~ 0.6. The distance to NGC5946
derived using the near-infrared brightness of the giant branch tip is in
excellent agreement with that computed from the V brightness of the HB if
E(B-V) = 0.6.
  The NGC7099 giant branch terminates ~ 1 mag fainter in K than the expected
tip brightness. The integrated J-K color of NGC7099 changes with radius, such
that Delta (J-K) /Delta log(r) = 0.05 - 0.09, depending on the technique used
to measure colors. Similar radial variations in stellar content might be
expected in NGC5946; however, the integrated J-K color of this cluster remains
constant with radius and, after removing the brightest resolved stars, a color
gradient is seen that is in the opposite sense to that in NGC7099. The relative
density of bright giant branch stars also remains constant within 30 arcsec of
the center of NGC5946. Therefore, it is concluded that NGC5946 does not contain
stellar content gradients similar to those seen in NGC7099 and other post

dependence on the ionic charge, as predicted by the Born model. We analyze this
behavior using second-order perturbation theory. This provides effective
methods to calculating free energies from equilibrium computer simulations. The
average and the fluctuation of the electrostatic potential at charge sites
appear as the first coefficients in a Taylor expansion of the free energy of
charging. Combining the data from different charge states allows calculation of
free-energy profiles as a function of the ionic charge. The first two Taylor
coefficients of the free-energy profiles can be computed accurately from equi-
librium simulations; but they are affected by a strong system-size dependence.
We apply corrections for these finite-size effects by using Ewald lattice sum-
mation and adding the self-interactions consistently. Results are presented for
a model ion with methane-like Lennard-Jones parameters in SPC water. We find
two very closely quadratic regimes with different parameters for positive and
negative ions. We also studied the hydration free energy of potassium, calcium,
fluoride, chloride, and bromide ions. We find negative ions to be solvated more
strongly compared to positive ions of equal size, in agreement with experimen-
tal data. We ascribe this preference of negative ions to their strong interac-
tions with water hydrogens, which can penetrate the ionic van der Waals shell
without direct energetic penalty in the models used. We also find a positive
electrostatic potential at the center of uncharged Lennard-Jones particles in
water, which favors negative ions. Regarding finite-system-size effects, we
show that even using only 16 water molecules it is possible to calculate accu-

that the growth evolves into, whether it becomes fractal and if so the
characteristics of the fractal pattern. Using a time dependent map the growing
region is conformally mapped onto the unit disk and the problem is converted to
the dynamics of a many-body system. The evolution is argued to be Hamiltonian,
and the Hamiltonian is shown to be the conjugate function of the real potential
field. Without surface effects the problem is ill-posed, but the Hamiltonian
structure of the dynamics allows introduction of surface effects as a repulsive
potential between the particles and the interface. This further leads to a
field representation of the problem, where the field's vacuum harbours the
zeros and the poles of the conformal map as particles and antiparticles. These
can be excited from the vacuum either by fluctuations or by surface effects.
Creation and annihilation of particles is shown to be consistent with the
formalism and lead to tip-splitting and side-branching. The Hamiltonian further
allows to make use of statistical mechanical tools to analyse the statistics of
the many-body system. I outline the way to convert the distribution of the
particles into the morphology of the interface. In particular, I relate the
particles statistics to the distributions of the curvature and the growth
probability along the physical interface and to the fractal dimension. If the
pattern turns fractal the latter distribution gives rise to a multifractal
spectrum, which can be explicitly calculated for a given particles
distribution. A `dilute boundary layer approximation' is discussed, which
allows explicit calculations and shows emergence of an algebraically long tail

different temperatures each follows a $q$-dependent master curve as a function
of scaled time. We show that during the early part of the $\alpha$-relaxation,
which is equivalent to the late part of the $\beta$-relaxation, these master
curves are well approximated by the master curve predicted by MCT for the
$\beta$-relaxation. This part is also fitted well by a power-law, the so-called
von Schweidler law. We show that the effective exponent $b'$ of this power-law
depends on the wave vector $q$ if $q$ is varied over a large range. The early
part of the $\beta$-relaxation regime does not show the critical decay
predicted by MCT. The $q$-dependence of the nonergodicity parameter for

conditions upon which fluctuations of a quantum field may transmute into
classical stochastic perturbations, which grew into galaxies. Our earlier works
have discussed the quantum origin of noise in stochastic inflation and quantum
fluctuations as measured by particle creation in semiclassical gravity. Here we
focus on decoherence and the relation of quantum and classical fluctuations.
Instead of using the rather ad hoc splitting of a quantum field into long and
short wavelength parts, the latter providing the noise which decoheres the
former, we treat a nonlinear theory and examine the decoherence of a quantum
mean field by its own quantum fluctuations, or that of other fields it
interacts with. This is an example of `dynamical decoherence' where an
effective open quantum system decoheres through its own dynamics. The model we
use to discuss fluctuation generation has the inflation field coupled to the
graviton field. We show that when the quantum to classical transition is
properly treated, with due consideration of the relation of decoherence, noise,
fluctuation and dissipation, the amplitude of density contrast predicted falls
in the acceptable range without requiring a fine tuning of the coupling
constant of the inflation field ($\lambda$). The conventional treatment which
requires an unnaturally small $\lambda \approx 10^{-12}$ stems from a basic
flaw in naively identifying classical perturbations with quantum fluctuations.

improvement of the chiral behaviour of $B_K$ is observed due to the Clover
action. We have also compared the results for $B_K$ obtained from two different
procedures for the boosting of the coupling constant $g$. We observe a strong
dependence of $B_K$ on the prescription adopted for $g$ in the Wilson case,
contrary to the results of the Clover case which are almost unaffected by the
choice of $g$. Combining some recently obtained non perturbative estimates for
the renormalisation constants with our Clover matrix element, we observe a
significant improvement in the chiral behaviour of $B_K$.
