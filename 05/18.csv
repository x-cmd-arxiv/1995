velocity bias. Using two simulations with identical initial conditions, one
following dark matter only and the other following dark matter and baryons,
both collisionless and collisional methods of tracing galaxies are compared to
one another and against a set of idealized criteria. None of the collisionless
methods proves satisfactory, including an elaborate scheme developed here to
circumvent previously known problems. The main problem is that galactic
overdensities are both secularly and impulsively disrupted while orbiting in
cluster potentials. With dissipation, the baryonic tracers have much higher
density contrasts and much smaller cross sections, allowing them to remain
distinct within the cluster potential. The question remains whether the
incomplete physical model introduces systematic biases. Statistical measures
determined from simulations can vary significantly based solely on the galaxy
tracing method utilized. The two point correlation function differs most on
sub-cluster scales with generally good agreement on larger scales. Pairwise
velocity dispersions show less uniformity on all scales addressed here. All
tracing methods show a velocity bias to varying degrees, but the predictions
are not firm: either the tracing method is not robust or the statistical
significance has not been demonstrated. Though theoretical arguments suggest
that a mild velocity bias should exist, simulation results are not yet
conclusive.

method to describe the growth history of bound virialized objects in the

Here we present the basic tool of this method, ``the confluent system
formalism'', which allows us to follow the filtering evolution of peaks in a
random Gaussian field of density fluctuations. This is applied to derive the
theoretical mass function of objects within the peak model framework. Along the
process followed for the derivation of this function, we prove that the
Gaussian window is the only one consistent with the peak model ansatz. We also
give a well justified derivation of the density of peaks with density contrast
upcrossing a given threshold in infinitesimal ranges of scale and correct this
scale function for the cloud-in-cloud effect. Finally, we characterize the form
of the mass vs. scale and the critical overdensity vs. collapse time relations
which are physically consistent with the peak model in an Einstein-de Sitter
universe with density field endowed with different power spectra. The result is
a fully justified semianalytical mass function which is close to the Press \&
Schechter (1974) one giving good fits to $N$-body simulations. But the interest
of the confluent system formalism is not merely formal. It allows us to
distinguish between accretion and merger events, which is essential for the
detailed modelling of the clustering process experienced by objects.

fraction of the struck quark with respect to $\xpom$, and of $Q^2$. The $\xpom$

pseudo-Goldstone bosons (PGBs), whose masses are typically expected to be
larger than 100 GeV. In this paper, we investigate the production and decay of
these particles at the high energy e^+ e^- experiments, LEP II and NLC. We find
that, in WTC models, the production of neutral PGBs can be significantly
enhanced, by one or two orders of magnitude, with respect to the predictions of
traditional (QCD-like) TC models. The origin of such an enhancement is the
existence of several low energy TC scales, that are likely to appear in WTC
theories. This could allow the PGBs to be observed even at the energy and
luminosity of the LEP II experiment. At LEP II, the PGBs are expected to be
produced in the e^+ e^- ==> P \gamma channel, and, possibly, in the e^+ e^- ==>
P e^+ e^- channel, with a total rate that can be of the order of several tenths
per year. Due to the typical large values of PGB masses, the relative branching
ratios of PGB decays, in WTC theories, are different from those predicted in
traditional TC models. In particular, a large fraction of these decays can
occur in the P ==> \gamma \gamma channel. In considering the PGB production, at
LEP II, we find that, in most of the final states, the distinctive signatures
of WTC events should allow the Standard Model background to be reduced to a
negligible level. We also find that, at a 500 GeV NLC experiment, the
production of neutral PGBs can occur in several channels, and can be of the
order of 10^3 events per year. Instead, when we consider traditional TC models,
we find that no PGB are typically predicted to be observed, both at LEP II and
the NLC experiment.

Lie algebra of physical states of an associated completely compactified
subcritical bosonic string, one can in principle determine the root spaces by
analyzing which (positive norm) physical states decouple from the $N$-string
vertex. Consequently, the Lie algebra of physical states decomposes into a
direct sum of the hyperbolic algebra and the space of decoupled states. Both
these spaces contain transversal and longitudinal states. Longitudinal
decoupling holds generally, and may also be valid for uncompactified strings,
with possible consequences for Liouville theory; the identification of the
decoupled states simply amounts to finding the zeroes of certain ``decoupling
polynomials''. This is not the case for transversal decoupling, which crucially
depends on special properties of the root lattice, as we explicitly demonstrate
for a non-trivial root space of $E_{10}$. Because the $N$-vertices of the
compactified string contain the complete information about decoupling, all the
properties of the hyperbolic algebra are encoded into them. In view of the
integer grading of hyperbolic algebras such as $E_{10}$ by the level, these
algebras can be interpreted as interacting strings moving on the respective
group manifolds associated with the underlying finite-dimensional Lie algebras.

dynamics (AMD). This is done by increasing the number of basic states in the
AMD wave function, introducing a Skyrme-type delta-nucleon potential, and
including $NN\leftrightarrow N\Delta$ reactions in the collision description.
As a test of the delta dynamics, the extended AMD is applied to (p,p$'$)
recations at $E_{\rm lab}=800$ MeV for a $^{12}$C target. It is found that the
ratio and the absolute values for delta peak and quasielastic peak (QEP) in the
$^{12}$C(p,p$'$) reaction are reproduced for angles $\Theta_{\rm lab} \agt
40^\circ$, pointing to a correct treatment of the delta dynamics in the
extended AMD. For forward angles the QEP is overestimated. The results of the
AMD calculations are compared to one-step Monte Carlo (OSMC) calculations and a
detailed analysis of multi-step and delta potential effects is given. As
important side results we present a way to apply a Gallilei invariant theory
for (N,N$'$) reactions up to $E_{\rm lab} \approx 800$ MeV which ensures
approximate Lorentz invariance and we discuss how to fix the width parameter
$\nu$ of the single particle momentum distribution for outgoing nucleons in the
AMD calculation.

essentially a ``complex analogue'' of the notion of symmetric tensor category,
and in fact a vertex tensor category produces a braided tensor category in a
natural way. In this paper, we focus on a particular element $P(z)$ of a
certain moduli space of three-punctured Riemann spheres; in general, every
element of this moduli space will give rise to a notion of tensor product, and
one must consider all these notions in order to construct a vertex tensor
category. Here we present the fundamental properties of the $P(z)$-tensor
product of two modules for a vertex operator algebra. We give two constructions
of a $P(z)$-tensor product, using the results, established in Parts I and II of
this series, for a certain other element of the moduli space. The definitions

the associativity of $P(z)$-tensor products for nonzero complex numbers $z$

associativity isomorphisms constructed in this paper are analogous to
associativity isomorphisms for vector space tensor products in the sense that
it relates the tensor products of three elements in three modules taken in
different ways. The main new feature is that they are controlled by the
decompositions of certain spheres with four punctures into spheres with three
punctures using a sewing operation. We also show that under certain conditions,
the existence of the associativity isomorphisms is equivalent to the
associativity (or (nonmeromorphic) operator product expansion in the language
of physicists) for the intertwining operators (or chiral vertex operators).
Thus the associativity of tensor products provides a means to establish the
(nonmeromorphic) operator product expansion.

one first has to verify that the vertex operator algebra satisfies certain
conditions. We show in the present paper that for any vertex operator algebra
containing a vertex operator subalgebra isomorphic to a tensor product algebra
of minimal Virasoro vertex operator algebras (vertex operator algebras
associated to minimal models), the tensor product theory can be applied. In
particular, intertwining operators for such a vertex operator algebra satisfy
the (nonmeromorphic) commutativity (locality) and the (nonmeromorphic)
associativity (operator product expansion). Combined with a result announced in
[HL4], the results of the present paper also show that the category of modules
for such a vertex operator algebra has a natural structure of a braided tensor
category. In particular, for any pair $p, q$ of relatively prime positive
integers larger than $1$, the category of minimal modules of central charge
$1-6\frac{(p-q)^{2}}{pq}$ for the Virasoro algebra has a natural structure of a
braided tensor category.

involved in standard non-relativistic quantum mechanics, with the help of
analogies from classical physics. A classical or quantum description of a
mechanical system involves a {\it framework}, often chosen implicitly, and a
{\it statement} or assertion about the system which is either true or false
within the framework with which it is associated. Quantum descriptions are no
less ``objective'' than their classical counterparts, but differ from the
latter in the following respects: (i) The framework employs a Hilbert space
rather than a classical phase space. (ii) The rules for constructing meaningful
statements require that the associated projectors commute with each other and,
in the case of time-dependent quantum histories, that consistency conditions be
satisfied. (iii) There are incompatible frameworks which cannot be combined,
either in constructing descriptions or in making logical inferences about them,
even though any one of these frameworks may be used separately for describing a
particular physical system.
  A new type of ``generalized history'' is introduced which extends previous
proposals by Omn\`es, and Gell-Mann and Hartle, and a corresponding consistency
condition which does not involve density matrices or single out a direction of
time. Applications which illustrate the formalism include: measurements of
spin, two-slit diffraction, and the emergence of the classical world from a
fully quantum description.
