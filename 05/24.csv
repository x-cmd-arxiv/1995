  appear in RevMexAA",,,,"astro-ph",,"  A newly developed isochrone synthesis algorithm for the photometric evolution
of galaxies is described. Two initial mass functions, IMFs, in particular, the
recent IMF determined by Kroupa, Tout, and Gilmore, three photometric
transformations, and a 1-Gyr-burst star formation rate, SFR, are used to
compute the $B-V$ and $V-K$ color index evolution. Non-negligible differences
are observed among model results.
  In the framework of the galaxy count model by Col\'in, Schramm, and Peimbert
a simple merging scenario is considered to account for the excess of galaxies
observed in the blue band counts. The excess is explained by the number and
luminosity evolution of a group of galaxies called interacting, I. It is
assumed that the number of I galaxies increases as $(1+z)^{\eta}$ due to
mergers. Moreover, it is proposed that their characteristic luminosity
increases as $(1+z)^3$ due to starbursts driven by galaxy-galaxy collision and
decreases as $(1+z)^{-\eta}$ due to the change in the size of the galaxies. Not
much number evolution is needed to account for the excess; for example, a model
with $\eta = 4.0$ predicts that about 17 \% of the galaxies at $z = 0.4$ are
interacting. Number evolution models with a rather high value of $\eta$ fit
better the data; in particular, the model with $\eta = 4.0$ predicts that about
13 \% of the galaxies have $z > 0.7$ in the $21.0 < m_{b_J} < 22.5$ interval,
this contrasts with the upper bound of 5 \% obtained with the sample of 78
galaxies by Colless et al. The excess of high redshift galaxies can not be
simply explained by changing reasonably the parameters of the luminosity
function of I galaxies. This result could indicate that mergers are not the
whole story. Our best-fit model produces the following values for the

cannot change the gross distribution of CMB anisotropies, but it may
redistribute the power and smooth the sharp features in the CMB power spectrum.
The magnitude of this effect is estimated using observational constraints on
the power spectrum of gravitational potential from galaxy and cluster surveys
and also using the limits on correlated ellipticities in distant galaxies. For
realistic CMB power spectra the effect on CMB multipole moments is less then a
few percent on degree angular scales, but gradually increases towards smaller
scales. On arcminute angular scales the acoustic oscillation peaks may be
partially or completely smoothed out because of the gravitational lensing.

Assuming the disks are co-planar, we characterize their deviation from
axisymmetry by the fractional amplitudes, A_i and phases of the azimuthal
Fourier components at radii R about the photometric galaxy center. We find that
most disks exhibit a wealth of non-axisymmetric structures, specifically: (1)
that about one third of them are substantially lopsided (A_1/A_0>= 0.20) at 2.5
disk exponential scale length, (2) that almost one half of them have strong
two-armed spirals with an arm/interarm surface-brightness contrasts of order
unity, and (3) that typical disks have some intrinsic ellipticity. We estimate
that in the disk plane the characteristic ellipticity of the underlying
potential is 0.045+-0.03. However, the spiral pattern couples significantly to
the estimate of the intrinsic ellipticity, and our measurement may represent an
upper limit on the ``true"" potential triaxiality. We estimate the radial
streaming motions of the disk stars, $v_R$, which are produced by these
distortions. By averaging over our sample of galaxies and all azimuthal angles,
we find v_R=7km/s due to lopsided distortions and 6km/s due to intrinsic
ellipticity. These non-circular motions are expected to contribute about
0.15mags scatter to measurements of the Tully-Fisher relation.

projection) a Local Set---the set of derivation trees generated by a CFG. This
provides a flexible approach to establishing language-theoretic complexity
results for formalisms that are based on systems of well-formedness constraints
on trees. We demonstrate this technique by sketching two such results for
Government and Binding Theory. First, we show that {\em free-indexation\/}, the
mechanism assumed to mediate a variety of agreement and binding relationships
in GB, is not definable in $L^2_{K,P}$ and therefore not enforcible by CFGs.
Second, we show how, in spite of this limitation, a reasonably complete GB
account of English can be defined in $L^2_{K,P}$. Consequently, the language
licensed by that account is strongly context-free. We illustrate some of the
issues involved in establishing this result by looking at the definition, in
$L^2_{K,P}$, of chains. The limitations of this definition provide some insight
into the types of natural linguistic principles that correspond to higher
levels of language complexity. We close with some speculation on the possible
significance of these results for generative linguistics.

  THU-95/14","gr-qc",,"  Ashtekar's canonical theory of classical complex Euclidean GR (no Lorentzian
reality conditions) is found to be invariant under the full algebra of
infinitesimal 4-diffeomorphisms, but non-invariant under some finite proper
4-diffeos when the densitized dreibein, $\tilE^a_i$, is degenerate. The
breakdown of 4-diffeo invariance appears to be due to the inability of the
Ashtekar Hamiltonian to generate births and deaths of $\tilE$ flux loops
(leaving open the possibility that a new `causality condition' forbidding the
birth of flux loops might justify the non-invariance of the theory).
  A fully 4-diffeo invariant canonical theory in Ashtekar's variables, derived
from Plebanski's action, is found to have constraints that are stronger than
Ashtekar's for $rank\tilE < 2$. The corresponding Hamiltonian generates births
and deaths of $\tilE$ flux loops.
  It is argued that this implies a finite amplitude for births and deaths of
loops in the physical states of quantum GR in the loop representation, thus
modifying this (partly defined) theory substantially.
  Some of the new constraints are second class, leading to difficulties in
quantization in the connection representation. This problem might be overcome
in a very nice way by transforming to the classical loop variables, or the
`Faraday line' variables of Newman and Rovelli, and then solving the offending
constraints.
  Note that, though motivated by quantum considerations, the present paper is
classical in substance.

mode occurs at zero temperature. This mode gives rise in finite nuclei

agrees with the observed value. We find that zero sound disappears at a
temperature of a few MeV, leaving only a broad peak in the dipole strength. For
Skyrme forces with a small value of the effective mass (0.4- 0.5), there is no
zero sound at zero temperature but only a weak peak located too high in energy.
The strength distribution in this case is nearly independent of temperature and
shows small collective effects. The relevance of these results for the
saturation of photon multiplicities observed in recent experiments is pointed

which is universal for quantum computation. This is done by explicitly
constructing the three--bit gate introduced by Deutsch [Proc.~R.~Soc.~London.~A
{\bf 425}, 73 (1989)] as a network consisting of replicas of a single two--bit
gate.

and postselection in two different time symmetric ways: We apply the ABL
formalism and the de Broglie--Bohm model. Interpreting these descriptions
ontologically, we get two very different concepts of reality. Finally, we
discuss some problems implied by these concepts.
