spiral galaxies. The method relies on the comparison of model predictions with
high spectral and spatial resolution HI observations of the gas layer.
  The potential arising from the {\em total} mass distribution of the galaxy is
used in the calculation of the vertical distribution of the gas. I developed a
new algorithm to calculate the force field of an arbitrary, azimuthally
symmetric, density distribution. This algorithm is used to calculate the forces
due to the radially truncated stellar disk as well as of the flaring gas layer.
  I use a simple two-parameter family of disk-halo models which have
essentially the same observed equatorial rotation curve but different vertical
forces. This mass model is composed of a stellar disk with constant M/L, and a
DM-halo with a given axial ratio. I approximate the radial force due to the
gaseous disk, and iteratively determine the vertical force due to the global
distribution of the gas.
  The thickness of the gaseous disk is sensitive to both the flattening of the
DM-halo and the self-gravity of the gas, but not to the particular choice of
disk-halo decomposition.
  I show that the determination of the thickness of the gas layer is not
restricted to edge-on galaxies, but can be measured for moderately inclined
systems as well.

rotating suprathermally, i.e. with kinetic energy substantially exceeding $k$
(the Boltzmann constant) over any temperature in the system. The paper studies
suprathermal rotation caused by H$_{2}$ formation and the alignment that takes
place due to crossover events. Gaseous bombardment in the course of a crossover
as well as both gaseous friction and poisoning of active sites are shown to
produce alignment. The first type of alignment happens due to the angular
momentum deposited by a corpuscular flux with a grain, the second is caused by
the change of the mean time back to crossover due to the interaction with a
gaseous flux. We show that the two processes act as to decrease the grain cross
section in respect to the flux and we find the Rayleigh reduction factor for
the joint action of the two processes as well as the range of applicability of
each of the processes. Our study indicates that mechanical alignment can be
more widely spread than it is generally accepted.

only a part of kinetic energy associated with the relative motion of two
subclusters is converted to internal energy of each subcluster at the first
encounter. We performed simulations for a variety of dark-matter (DM)
distributions, and find that the time scale for washing out the double peak
structures after the first encounter strongly depends on the distribution of
the density and velocity distributions of the DM. It takes longer when the DM
is spatially extended. According to our calculation it takes more than $4 imes
10^9$yr after the first encounter until the density contour shows only a single
peak.
  To explain the high fraction of the clusters with substructures among nearby

subcluster merging is still uncertain and possibly much longer than the time

present paper applies two approximate analytical methods to the investigation
of critical properties of the self-avoiding loop model with variable bending
rigidity, discusses their validity and makes comparison with known MC results.
One method is based on the independent loop approximation used in the
literature for studying phase transitions in polymers, liquid helium and cosmic
strings. The second method relies on the known exact solution of the
self-avoiding loop model with bending rigidity $\eta = 1/\sqrt{2}$. The present
investigation confirms recent findings that the strong coupling lattice
Schwinger model becomes critical for $\kappa_{cr} \simeq 0.38-0.39$. The phase
transition is of second order and lies in the Ising model universality class.
Finally, the central charge of the strong coupling Schwinger model at

convolution formula for the nuclear structure function in terms of $\xi$ and

expected to break down. Our analysis is aimed at the final goal of clarifying
the range of applicability of local duality ideas in nuclei.

can reconstruct the topological information encoded in the theta term. In the
topologically trivial cases the theta term gives only a trivial shift to the
ground state energy but in the topologically nontrivial ones it remains to be
coupled to the dynamics in the continuum. In particular for the U($N$) gauge
group on orientable surfaces it gives rise to a phase transition at $\theta=
\pi$, similar to the ones observed in other models. Using the equivalence of 2d

product expansion and Bjorken-Johnson-Low limit techniques. We first study the
two dimensional case and give the covariant expression for the commutators. The
expression in terms of light-cone coordinates is then calculated and found to
be in perfect agreement with the results in the literature. The particular
scenario of the light-cone frame is revisited using a reformulation of the BJL
limit in such a frame. The arguments used for $n=2$ are then generalized to the
case of any even dimensional Minkowskian spacetime and it is shown that there
are no anomalous contributions to the commutators for $n\not=2$. These results
are found to be valid for both fermionic and bosonic free fields. A
generalization of the BJL-limit is later used to obtain double commutators of
energy-momentum tensors and to study the Jacobi identity. The two dimensional
case is studied and we find no existance of 3-cocycles in both the Abelian and
non-Abelian case.
