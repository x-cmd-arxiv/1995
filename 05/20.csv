where a finite number of states, most-commonly two, are available for each
orbital state within a degenerate Landau level and will refer to these systems
as multi-component systems. Physical realizations of the additional degree of
freedom include the electron spin, the valley index in multi-valley
semiconductors, and the layer index in multiple-quantum-well systems. The
consideration of multi-component systems expands the taxonomy of incompressible
states and fractionally charged excitations, and for example, leads to the
appearance of fractions with even denominators. More interestingly, it also
leads us to new physics, including novel spontaneously broken symmetries and in
some cases, finite temperature phase transitions. We present an introduction to

Indeterministic quantum gravity is a theory that unifies general relativity and

the same token the theory claims to describe all the universe.
  Spacetime is the direct product of cosmic time and space. The state of the
universe is given by metric, its derivative with respect to cosmic time, and
the number of an energy level. A quantum jump occurs at the tangency of two
levels. Equations of motion are the restricted Einstein equation (the cosmic

have no other causal pathology. These are Lorentzian universes-from-nothing,
spacetimes with a single spacelike boundary that nevertheless have a smooth
Lorentzian metric. Classically, such spacetimes are locally indistinguishable
from their globally hyperbolic covering spaces. However, the construction of a
quantum field theory (QFT) is more problematic. One can define a family of
local algebras on an atlas of globally hyperbolic subspacetimes. But one cannot
extend a generic positive linear function from a single algebra to the
collection of all local algebras without violating positivity, while satisfying
the physically appropriate overlap conditions. This difficulty can be overcome
by restricting the size of neighborhoods so that the union of any pair is time-
orientable. The structure of local algebras and states is then locally
indistinguishable from that of QFT on a globally hyperbolic spacetime. But this
size restriction on neighborhoods makes the structure unsatisfactory as a
global field theory. The theory allows less information than QFT in a globally
hyperbolic spacetime, because correlations between field operators at a pair of
points are defined only if a curve joining the points lies in a single neigh-
borhood. Moreover, to extend a local state to a collection of states, we use an
antipodally symmetric state on the covering space, a state that would not yield
a sensible state on the spacetime if all correlations could be measured.

back-reaction of a quantised matter field on a classical metric is given by the
expectation value of its energy-momentum tensor, evaluated in a specified
state. This proposal can be expected to be quite sound only when the
fluctuations in the energy-momentum tensor of the quantum field are negligible.
Based on this condition, a dimensionless criterion has been suggested earlier
by Kuo and Ford for drawing the limits on the validity of this semiclassical
theory. In this paper, we examine this criterion for the case of a toy model,
constructed with two degrees of freedom and a coupling between them that
exactly mimics the behaviour of a scalar field in a Friedmann universe. To
reproduce the semiclassical regime of the field theory, in the toy model, one
of degrees of freedom is assumed to be classical and the other quantum
mechanical. Also the backreaction is assumed to be given by the expectation
values of the quantum operators involved in the equations of motion for the
classical system. Motivated by the same physical reasoning as Kuo and Ford, we,
here, suggest another criterion, one which will be shown to perform more
reliably as we evaluate these criterions for different states of the quantum
system in the toy model. Finally, from the results obtained we conclude that
the semiclassical theory being considered for the toy model is reliable, during
all stages of its evolution, only if the quantum system is specified to be in
coherent like states. The implications of these investigations on field theory
are discussed.

well-known diagnostic for the nature of the physics which is responsible for
the decay. Three types of spectra are usually considered when these experiments
are analysed: one each for the standard two-neutrino decay, the neutrinoless
process and a scalar-emitting decay. It has recently been shown that two other
electron spectra can be possible for scalar-emitting modes, in addition to
these traditional three. One of these is softer than the Standard-Model
two-neutrino decay, while the other is intermediate between this and the usual
majoron-emitting spectrum. The models which predict these new spectra are
generically more natural than those which predict the traditional
majoron-emitting spectrum, in that they can accomodate the constraints
following from the steadily improving limits on neutrinoless decay without
requiring the fine-tuning that is endemic to the usual models. This article
reviews the properties of the physics which can produce the new kinds of
electron spectra. (Invited Talk presented to the Workshop on Double Beta Decay

show that, in this very same region, also a well-known discrepancy between the
low and high energy determinations of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ can be disposed of.
Specifically, we find that the lineshape determination of the strong coupling
constant, which in the SM points towards the large central value $\alpha_s(M_Z)

suggested by the wealth of low-energy data, namely $\alpha_s(M_Z) \simeq 0.11$,
which is smaller and more in line with the traditional QCD expectations at low
energy. Our approach differs from previous analyses in that we argue that the
desired matching could originate to a large extent from a purely electroweak
supersymmetric quantum effect.
