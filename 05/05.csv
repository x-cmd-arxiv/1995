cluster Abell 754. Our comparison of new optical data and archival ROSAT PSPC
X-ray data reveal three collision signatures predicted by n-body/hydrodynamical
simulations of hierarchical cluster evolution. First, there is strong evidence
of a non-hydrostatic process; neither of the two major clumps in the galaxy
distribution lies on the off-center peak of the X-ray emission from the
intracluster gas. Second, the peak of the X-ray emission is elongated
perpendicular to the collision axis defined by the centroids of the two galaxy
clumps. Third, there is evidence of compression-heated gas; one of A754's two
X-ray temperature components (Henry & Briel 1995) is among the hottest observed
in any cluster and hotter than that inferred from the velocity dispersion of
the associated galaxy clump. These signatures are consistent with the
qualitative features of simulations (Evrard 1990a,b) in which two subclusters
have collided in the plane of the sky during roughly the last Gyr. The
detection of such collisions is crucial for understanding both the dynamics of
individual clusters and the underlying cosmology. First, for systems like A754,
estimating the cluster X-ray mass from assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium
and isothermality is incorrect and may produce the discrepancies sometimes
found between X-ray masses and those derived from gravitational lens models
(Babul & Miralda-Escude 1994). Second, the fraction of nearby clusters in which
subclusters have collided in the last Gyr is especially sensitive to the mean
mass density parameter Omega_0 (cf. Richstone et al. 1992; Evrard et al. 1993;
Lacey & Cole 1993). With a large, well-defined cluster sample, it will be
possible to place a new and powerful constraint on cosmological models.

Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) in the mass range $10^{-15} M_{\odot}\lsim M
\lsim 10^{-7} M_{\odot}$ provided that GRBs prove to be cosmological.
Previously devised methods for detecting MACHOs have spanned the mass range
$10^{-16} M_{\odot}\lsim M \lsim 10^{7} M_{\odot}$, but with a gap of several
orders of magnitude near $10^{-9} M_{\odot}$. For MACHOs and sources both at a
cosmological distance, the Einstein radius is $\sim 1\,\au\,(M/10^{-7}
M_\odot)^{1/2}$. Hence, if a GRB lies within the Einstein ring of a MACHO of
mass $M\lsim 10^{-7}M_\odot$ as seen by one detector, it will not lie in the
Einstein ring as seen by a second detector $\sim 1\,\au$ away. This implies
that if GRBs are measured to have significantly different fluxes by the two
detectors, this would signal the presence of a MACHO $\lsim 10^{-7}M_\odot$. By
the same token, if the two detectors measured similar fluxes for several
hundred events a cosmological abundance of such low-mass MACHOs would be ruled
out. The lower limit of sensitivity, $M\lsim 10^{-15}M_\odot$ is set by the
finite size of the source. If low-mass MACHOs are detected, there are tests
which can discriminate among events generated by MACHOs in the three mass
ranges $M\lsim 10^{-12}\,M_\odot$, $10^{-12}\,M_\odot\lsim M\lsim
10^{-7}\,M_\odot$, and $M\gsim 10^{-7}\ M_\odot$. Further experiments would
then be required to make more accurate mass measurements.

GR (Schwarzschild) and NGT (Wyman-type) static backgrounds, it is shown that
spherically symmetric systems are not guaranteed to be static, and hence
Birkhoff's theorem is not valid in NGT. This implies that in general one must
consider time dependent exteriors when looking at spherically symmetric systems
in NGT. For the surviving monopole mode considered here there is no energy flux
as it is short ranged by construction. Further work on the spherically
symmetric case will be motivated through a discussion of the possibility that
there remain additional modes that do not show up in weak field situations, but
nonetheless exist in the full theory and may again result in bad global
asymptotics. A presentation of the action and field equations in a general

dealing with the algebraic complications inherent in NGT, as well as offering a
more general framework for discussing the physics of the antisymmetric sector.
