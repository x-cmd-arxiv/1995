Schubert variety in the integral cohomology ring of the flag manifold. This
formula also describes the multiplication of a Schubert polynomial by either an
elementary symmetric polynomial or a complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial.
Thus, we generalize the classical Pieri's rule for symmetric
polynomials/Grassmann varieties to Schubert polynomials/flag manifolds. Our
primary technique is an explicit geometric description of certain intersections
of Schubert varieties. This method allows us to compute additional structure
constants for the cohomology ring, which we express in terms of paths in the
Bruhat order on the symmetric group.

simple and clear physical terms the secular and dynamical instabilities as well
as the bifurcations along equilibrium sequences of rotating, self-gravitating
fluid systems. Here we investigate the secular and dynamical 3rd-harmonic
instabilities that appear first on the Jacobi sequence of incompressible zero-
vorticity ellipsoids. Poincare found a bifurcation point on the Jacobi sequence
where a 3rd-harmonic mode becomes neutral. A sequence of pear-shaped equilibria
branches off at this point but stands at higher energies. Therefore, the Jacobi
ellipsoids remain secularly and dynamically stable. Cartan found that dynamical
3rd-harmonic instability also sets in at the Jacobi-pear bifurcation. We find
that Cartan's instability leads to differentially rotating objects and not to
uniformly rotating pear-shaped equilibria. We demonstrate that the pear-shaped
sequence exists at higher energies and at higher rotation relative to the
Jacobi sequence. The Jacobi ellipsoid undergoes fission on a secular time scale
and a short-period binary is produced. The classical fission hypothesis of
binary-star formation of Poincare and Darwin is thus feasible.

one case the strongest known cosmic ray is paired with the strongest gamma-ray
burst in the BATSE catalogue. The probability of this to have occurred by
chance seems rather small. Without building on post-factum statistics, we think
the above is remarkable enough to suggest that the cosmic ray and gamma-ray
burst were produced by the same outburst. A time delay (and a small positional
disparity) is expected, since the trajectory of a charged cosmic-ray particle
is wriggled by intervening magnetic fields. We estimate that the Galaxy's field
alone may produce a delay of the order observed. We discuss some of the
implications that follow if such an association is confirmed. For example, the
upper limit on the distance to the cosmic-ray source, combined with a
much-better-determined position of the gamma-ray burst source, narrows greatly
the volume in which to look for an optical counterpart. There is also useful
information in the time delay regarding, e.g., intergalactic magnetic fields.

properties compatible with the lightest scalar glueball predicted by lattice
QCD and incompatible with a $\qqbar$ state. We suggest that decays of glueballs
are into pairs of glueballs (including $\eta, \eta'$ or $(\pi\pi)_S$) or by
mixing with nearby $Q\bar{Q}$ states. The partial widths of $f_0(1500)$ are in
accord with this hypothesis, tests of which include characteristic radiative
decays to $\gamma\phi,\gamma\omega, \gamma\rho$ and the prediction of a further
scalar state, $f_0'(1500 - 1800)$ which couples strongly to $K\bar{K}$,
$\eta\eta$ and $\eta\eta'$.

chaotic inflation scenarios. We find that the reheating temperature may depart

These terms correspond to renormalon singularities in the Borel plane and are
expected asymptotically to dominate the coefficients to all orders in the
$1/N_{f}$ expansion. Remarkably, we note that this is already apparent in
comparisons with the exact next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-NLO (NNLO)
perturbative coefficients. The ultra-violet ($UV$) and infra-red ($IR$)
renormalon singularities in the Borel transform are isolated and the Borel sum
(principal value regulated for $IR$) performed. Resummed results are also
obtained for the Minkowski quantities related to the $D$-function, the
$e^{+}e^{-}$ $R$-ratio and the analogous $\tau$-lepton decay ratio, $R_{\tau}$.
The renormalization scheme dependence of these partial resummations is
discussed and they are compared with the results from other groups [1--3] and
with exact fixed order perturbation theory at NNLO. Prospects for improving the
resummation by including more exact details of the Borel transform are
considered.

string unification scale disagrees with the GUT scale obtained by extrapolating
low-energy data within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard

minimal string predictions and thereby bring string-scale unification into
agreement with low-energy data. These include heavy string threshold
corrections, non-standard hypercharge normalizations, light SUSY thresholds,
intermediate gauge structure, and thresholds arising from extra matter beyond
the MSSM. We explicitly evaluate these contributions within a variety of
realistic free-fermionic string models, including the flipped SU(5), SO(6) x
SO(4), and various SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) models, and find that most of these
sources do not substantially alter the minimal string predictions. Indeed, we
find that the only way to reconcile string unification with low-energy data is
through certain types of extra matter. Remarkably, however, many of the
realistic string models contain precisely this required matter in their
low-energy spectra.
