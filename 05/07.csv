computer simulations and mean-field theoretical approaches. The phenomenon of
stochastic resonance is revealed. The characteristic peak obtained for the
correlation function between the external oscillating magnetic field and
magnetization versus the temperature of the system, is studied for various
external fields and lattice sizes. Excellent agreement between simulation and
theoretical results are obtained.

detectable at a luminosity upgraded 2 TeV Fermilab Tevatron collider. Using a
full event-level Monte Carlo based on Pythia/Jetset, we simulate the trilepton
signal examining in detail the effect of constraints on the parameter space. We
also simulate the monolepton and dilepton signals, the missing E_T + jets
signal, and the signals of stop production in supersymmetry all with full
Standard Model backgrounds with realistic detector cuts. We find that large
fractions of parameter space can be probed (or eliminated if no signal is
found), but mass limits on charginos and neutralinos are not possible based
solely on the trilepton signal. Detection efficiencies depend strongly on
supersymmetry parameters beyond simply the neutralino and chargino masses;
analyses (experimental or theoretical) that do not include this will draw
misleading conclusions. Finally, we comment on how searches at LEP II will
complement searches at Fermilab.

order where the parasupersymmetry is between the normal bosons and those
corresponding to the truncated harmonic oscillator. We show that even though
the parasusy algebra is different from that of the usual parasusy quantum
mechanics, still the consequences of the two are identical. We further show
that the parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics of arbitrary order p can also be
rewritten in terms of p supercharges (i.e. all of which obey $Q_i^{2} = 0$).
However, the Hamiltonian cannot be expressed in a simple form in terms of the p
supercharges except in a special case. A model of conformal parasupersymmetry
is also discussed and it is shown that in this case, the p supercharges, the p
conformal supercharges along with Hamiltonian H, conformal generator K and
dilatation generator D form a closed algebra.

  Theories","To be published in the Proceedings of Indian National Science
  Academy, Part A-physical Sciences","Proc.Indian Natl.Sci.Acad.A61:161-178,1995",,"IP-BBSR/95-3, January 95","hep-th",,"  In this article we review some of the recent advances regarding the charged
vortex solutions in abelian and nonabelian gauge theories with Chern-Simons
(CS) term in two space dimensions. Since these nontrivial results are
essentially because of the CS term, hence, we first discuss in some detail the
various properties of the CS term in two space dimensions. In particular, it is
pointed out that this parity (P) and time reversal (T) violating but gauge
invariant term when added to the Maxwell Lagrangian gives a massive gauge
quanta and yet the theory is still gauge invariant. Further, the vacuum of such
a theory shows the magneto-electric effect. Besides, we show that the CS term
can also be generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking as well as by radiative
corrections. A detailed discussion about Coleman-Hill theorem is also given
which aserts that the parity-odd piece of the vacuum polarization tensor at
zero momentum transfer is unaffected by two and multi-loop effects. Topological
quantization of the coefficient of the CS term in nonabelian gauge theories is
also elaborated in some detail. One of the dramatic effect of the CS term is
that the vortices of the abelian (as well as nonabelian) Higgs model now
acquire finite quantized charge and angular momentum. The various properties of
these vortices are discussed at length with special emphasis on some of the
recent developments including the discovery of the self-dual charged vortex
solutions.
