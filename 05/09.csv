this new result with that of Lauer and Postman, with which there is apparent

window functions between the two samples used for the measurements results in a
low level of expected correlation between the estimated bulk flows. We
calculate a $\chi^2$ for the two measurements taken together and find that
their lack of agreement tends to disfavor spectra with excessive power on large
scales, but not at a level sufficient to rule them out. A sample consisting of
other SN type Ia's found in the Asiago catalog is used to study how the

analysis of a five dimensional differential cross section of angular

measurement of TGV's. LEP200 will improve existing measurements of TGV's but
not enough to see loop contributions of new physics. Measurements at the NLC
will be roughly 2 orders of magnitude more precise which would probe the

In analogy with the Watson-Migdal approximation, it is shown that in the limit
of extremely strong final state effects, the amplitude factorizes into a
primary production amplitude and an elastic scattering amplitude describing a
$3 \to 3$ transition. This amplitude determines the energy dependence of the
reaction cross section near the reaction threshold almost solely. The
approximation proposed satisfies the Fermi-Watson theorem and the coherence
formalism. Application of this procedure to meson production in nucleon-nucleon

are small for s-wave pion production, they are crucial for reproducing the

class of realistic free-fermionic string models which have appeared in the
literature, including the flipped SU(5), SO(6)xSO(4), and various
SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) models. If the matter spectrum below the string scale is that
of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), then string unification is
in disagreement with experiment. We therefore examine several effects that may
modify the minimal string predictions. First, we develop a systematic procedure
for evaluating the one-loop heavy string threshold corrections in
free-fermionic string models, and we explicitly evaluate these corrections for
each of the realistic models. We find that these string threshold corrections
are small, and we provide general arguments explaining why such threshold
corrections are suppressed in string theory. Thus heavy thresholds cannot
resolve the disagreement with experiment. We also study the effect of
non-standard hypercharge normalizations, light SUSY thresholds, and
intermediate-scale gauge structure, and similarly conclude that these effects
cannot resolve the disagreement with low-energy data. Finally, we examine the
effects of additional color triplets and electroweak doublets beyond the MSSM.
Although not required in ordinary grand unification scenarios, such states
generically appear within the context of certain realistic free-fermionic
string models. We show that if these states exist at the appropriate
thresholds, then the gauge couplings will indeed unify at the string scale.
Thus, within these string models, string unification can be in agreement with
low-energy data.

relativistic quantum mechanics. It is based on the assumption that whenever
probability distributions arise, there exists a stochastic process that is
either responsible for temporal evolution of a given measure or preserves the
measure in the stationary case. Our departure point is the so-called
Schr\""{o}dinger problem of probabilistic evolution, which provides for a unique
Markov stochastic interpolation between any given pair of boundary probability
densities for a process covering a fixed, finite duration of time, provided we
have decided a priori what kind of primordial dynamical semigroup transition
mechanism is involved. In the nonrelativistic theory, including quantum
mechanics, Feyman-Kac-like kernels are the building blocks for suitable
transition probability densities of the process. In the standard ""free"" case
(Feynman-Kac potential equal to zero) the familiar Wiener noise is recovered.
In the framework of the Schr\""{o}dinger problem, the ""free noise"" can also be
extended to any infinitely divisible probability law, as covered by the
L\'{e}vy-Khintchine formula. Since the relativistic Hamiltonians $|\nabla |$
and $\sqrt {-\triangle +m^2}-m$ are known to generate such laws, we focus on
them for the analysis of probabilistic phenomena, which are shown to be
associated with the relativistic wave (D'Alembert) and matter-wave
(Klein-Gordon) equations, respectively. We show that such stochastic processes
exist and are spatial jump processes. In general, in the presence of external
potentials, they do not share the Markov property, except for stationary
situations. A concrete example of the pseudodifferential Cauchy-Schr\""{o}dinger
evolution is analyzed in detail. The relativistic covariance of related wave
