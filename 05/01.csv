  Accepted for publication to the M.N.R.A.S",,"10.1093/mnras/276.4.1109",,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate the formation of clusters of galaxies in an expanding universe
using a new code that regrids at a region of high density. In particular we
investigate two models for the initial conditions, both with the standard CDM
power spectrum - one has $\Omega = 1$ and the other $\Omega = 0.2$. Both
universes have $H_0 = 100 \kms\mpc^{-1}$ and $\Lambda = 0$. The level of
substructure in the final cluster can be used as a discriminant of the cosmic
density. We discuss various statistics which can be measured observationally
from clusters of galaxies, that can be used to discriminate between the two
models. We find that most of the statistics that use the clusters' member
galaxies may not be the best measures of substructure. Statistics that rely
more on X-ray maps and other observables depending more directly on the mass
distribution could be better discriminants of $\Omega$.

method benefiting from both semantic properties of functional constraints (not

not all the constraints need to be functional. We show that under some
conditions, the existence of solutions can be guaranteed. We first characterize
a particular subset of the variables, which we name a root set. We then
introduce pivot consistency, a new local consistency which is a weak form of
path consistency and can be achieved in O(n^2d^2) complexity (instead of
O(n^3d^3) for path consistency), and we present associated properties; in
particular, we show that any consistent instantiation of the root set can be
linearly extended to a solution, which leads to the presentation of the
aforementioned new method for solving by decomposing functional CSPs.

inadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a
result, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI,
hindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded
optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a
solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture
and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property
for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time
environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated
mail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded
optimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical
complexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs
that are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO
programs can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude
with a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical
basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and
game theory.
