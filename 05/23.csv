degree $\le 10$. All known rational surfaces in $\PP^4$ can be represented as
blow-ups of the plane $\PP^2$. The fine classification of these surfaces
consists of giving explicit open and closed conditions which determine the
configurations of points corresponding to all surfaces in a given family. Using
a restriction argument originally due independently to Alexander and Bauer we
achieve the fine classification in two cases, namely non-special rational
surfaces of degree 9 and special rational surfaces of degree 8. The first case
completes the fine classification of all non-special rational surfaces. In the
second case we obtain a description of the moduli space as the quotient of a
rational variety by the symmetric group $S_5$. We also discuss in how far this
method can be used to study other rational surfaces in $\PP^4$.

the non-Hubble component of galaxy motions. By measuring such distortions in
the linear regime one can constrain the quantity $\beta = \Omega^{0.6}/b$ where
$\Omega$ is the cosmological density parameter and $b$ is the (linear) bias
factor for optically-selected galaxies. In this paper we apply two techniques
for estimating $\beta$ from the Stromlo-APM redshift survey --- (1) measuring
the anisotropy of the redshift space correlation function in spherical
harmonics and (2) comparing the amplitude of the direction-averaged redshift
space correlation function to the real space correlation function. We test the
validity of these techniques, particularly whether the assumption of linear
theory is justified, using two sets of large $N$-body simulations. We find that
the first technique is affected by non-linearities on scales up to $\sim 30
\hMpc$. The second technique is less sensitive to non-linear effects and so is
more useful for existing redshift surveys. The Stromlo-APM survey data favours
a low value for $\beta$, with $\beta \simlt 0.6$. A bias parameter $b \approx
2$ is thus required if $\Omega \equiv 1$. However, higher-order correlations
measured from the APM galaxy survey (Gazta\~{n}aga and Frieman 1994) indicate a
low value for the bias parameter $b \approx 1$, requiring that $\Omega \simlt
0.5$. We also measure the relative bias for samples of galaxies of various
luminosity and morphological type and find that low-luminosity galaxies are
roughly three times less biased than $L^*$ galaxies. For the galaxy population
as a whole, we measure a real space variance of galaxy counts in $8 \hMpc$
spheres of $(\sigma^2_8)_g = 0.89 \pm 0.05$.

and stems from the Landau-Ginzburg theory of phase transitions. Here we examine
higher than 2nd-harmonic disturbances applied to Maclaurin spheroids, the
corresponding bifurcating sequences, and their relation to nonlinear fission
processes. The triangle and ammonite sequences bifurcate from the two
3rd-harmonic neutral points on the Maclaurin sequence while the square and
one-ring sequences bifurcate from two of the three known 4th harmonic neutral
points. In the other three cases, secular instability does not set in at the
corresponding bifurcation points because the sequences stand and terminate at
higher energies relative to the Maclaurin sequence. There is no known
bifurcating sequence at the point of 3rd-harmonic dynamical instability. Our
nonlinear approach easily identifies resonances between the Maclaurin sequence
and various multi-fluid-body sequences that cannot be detected by linear
stability analyses. Resonances appear as first-order phase transitions at
points where the energies of the two sequences are nearly equal but the lower
energy state belongs to one of the multi-fluid-body sequences.

specific types of belief can be used to summarize all the states of nested
belief that can exist about a domain entity.
  Here, we set out to design a ``compiler'' for belief models. This system will
accept as input a description of agents' interactions with a task domain
expressed in a fully-expressive belief logic with non-monotonic and temporal
extensions. It generates an operational belief model for use in that domain,
sufficient for the requirements of cooperative dialogue, including the
negotiation of complex domain plans. The compiled model incorporates the belief
simplification mentioned above, and also uses a simplified temporal logic of
belief based on the restricted circumstances under which beliefs can change.
  We shall review the motivation for creating such a system, and introduce a
general procedure for taking a logical specification for a domain and procesing
it into an operational model. We shall then discuss the specific changes that
are made during this procedure for limiting the level of abstraction at which
the concepts of belief nesting, default reasoning and time are expressed.

by the O(3) non-linear $\sigma$-model with current-current interactions between
the fermionic degrees of freedom and the order-parameter field for the
spin-background, an alternative description in form of an U(1) gauge theory can
be derived by choosing the SQA defined by the local direction of the
order-parameter field via a SU(2) rotation of the fermionic spinor. Within a
large-$N$ expansion of this U(1) gauge theory we obtain the phase diagram for
the doped AF and identify the relevant terms due to doping that lead to a
quantum phase transition at $T=0$ from the antiferromagnetically ordered N\'eel
phase to the quantum-disordered (QD) spin-liquid phase. Furthermore, we
calculate the propagator of the corresponding U(1) gauge field, which mediates
a long-range transverse interaction between the bosonic and fermionic fields.
It is found that the strength of the propagator is proportional to the gap of
the spin-excitations. Therefore, we expect as a consequence of this long-range
interaction the formation of bound states when the spin-gap opens, i.e.\ in the
QD spin-liquid phase. The possible bound states are spin-waves with a (spin-)
gap in the excitation spectrum, spinless fermions and pairs of fermions. Thus,
an alternative picture for charge-spin separation emerges, with composite
charge-separated excitations. Moreover, the present treatment shows an intimate

particle-emitting source can be extracted from gaussian fits to two-particle
correlation data. Although the formalism is completely general, extraction of
the relevant parameters is much simpler for sources within an interesting class
of azimuthally symmetric models. After discussing the standard fitting
procedure, we introduce a new gaussian fitting procedure which is an
azimuthally symmetric generalization of the Yano-Koonin formalism for
spherically symmetric sources. This new fitting procedure has the advantage
that in addition to being able to measure source parameters in a fixed frame or
the longitudinally co-moving system, it can also measure these parameters in
the local rest frame of the source.

broad rapidity interval with the squared proton densities and inversely with
the produced particle rapidity densities. This kind of scaling can be linked to
constant relative sizes of nucleon and pion sources at freeze-out. With
increasing projectile mass the nucleon source blows up stronger than the pion
source. As a result, the scaled deuteron densities drop in central Pb+Pb

  Rev. E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.52.2478",,"patt-sol chao-dyn nlin.CD nlin.PS",,"  We study coupled maps on a Cayley tree, with local (nearest-neighbor)
interactions, and with a variety of boundary conditions. The homogeneous state
(where every lattice site has the same value) and the node-synchronized state
(where sites of a given generation have the same value) are both shown to occur
for particular values of the parameters and coupling constants. We study the
stability of these states and their domains of attraction. As the number of
sites that become synchronized is much higher compared to that on a regular
lattice, control is easier to effect. A general procedure is given to deduce
the eigenvalue spectrum for these states. Perturbations of the synchronized
state lead to different spatio-temporal structures. We find that a mean-field
like treatment is valid on this (effectively infinite dimensional) lattice.

to investigate the magnetic properties of superconducting (Tc~8K) HoNi2B2C. The
inelastic measurements reveal that the lowest two crystal field transitions out
of the ground state occurat 11.28(3) and 16.00(2) meV, while the transition of
4.70(9) meV between these two levels is observed at elevated temperatures. The
temperature dependence of the intensities of these transitions is consistent
with both the ground state and these higher levels being magnetic doublets. The
system becomes magnetically long range ordered below 8K, and since this
ordering energy kTN ~ 0.69meV << 11.28meV the magnetic properties in the
ordered phase are dominated by the ground-state spin dynamics only. The low
temperature structure, which coexists with superconductivity, consists of
ferromagnetic sheets of Ho{3+ moments in the a-b plane, with the sheets coupled
antiferromagnetically along the c-axis. The magnetic state that initially forms
on cooling, however, is dominated by an incommensurate spiral antiferromagnetic
state along the c-axis, with wave vector qc ~0.054 A-1, in which these
ferromagnetic sheets are canted from their low temperature antiparallel
configuration by ~17 deg. The intensity for this spiral state reaches a maximum
near the reentrant superconducting transition at ~5K; the spiral state then
collapses at lower temperature in favor of the commensurate antiferromagnetic
state. We have investigated the field dependence of the magnetic order at and
above this reentrant superconducting transition. Initially the field rotates
the powder particles to align the a-b plane along the field direction,
demonstrating that the moments strongly prefer to lie within this plane due to
the crystal field anisotropy. Upon subsequently increasing the field at
