Quaternionic monopoles. These monopoles are associated with
Spin^h(4)-structures on 4-manifolds and form finite-dimensional moduli spaces.
On a Kahler surface the quaternionic monopole equations decouple and lead to
the projective vortex equation for holomorphic pairs. This vortex equation
comes from a moment map and gives rise to a new complex-geometric stability
concept. The moduli spaces of quaternionic monopoles on Kahler surfaces have
two closed subspaces, both naturally isomorphic with moduli spaces of
canonically stable holomorphic pairs. These components intersect along
Donaldsons instanton space and can be compactified with Seiberg-Witten moduli
spaces. This should provide a link between the two corresponding theories.
Notes: To appear in CMP The revised version contains more details concerning
the Uhlenbeck compactfication of the moduli space of quaternionic monopoles,
and possible applications are discussed. Attention ! Due to an ununderstandable
mistake, the duke server had replaced all the symbols ""="" by ""=3D"" in the

Brotherton (Univ. of Texas at Austin, USA)","AN IMPROVED MEASURE OF QUASAR ORIENTATION","7 pages (aastex), 3 figures added (1 file via uufiles)",,"10.1086/309614",,"astro-ph",,"  Radio core dominance, usually measured by R, the rest frame ratio of core to
lobe flux density, has been used as an indicator of Doppler boosting of
quasars' radio jets and hence the inclination of the central engine's spin axis
to the line of sight. The use of lobe flux density as a means of normalizing
the boosted core flux density to the available intrinsic power of the central
engine introduces scatter. This is because the emission from the radio lobes
depends strongly on the interaction of the jet with the environment at
distances beyond several Kpc from the nucleus. Total kinetic power in the
extended radio emission is approximately proportional to emission line
luminosity, and emission line luminosity is proportional to the luminosity of
AGNs' featureless continua -- both over 4 orders of magnitude. Thus, quasars'
optical luminosity may be an excellent measure of available intrinsic jet
power. Therefore we define a new core dominance parameter, R$_V$, the ratio of
radio core to optical (rest frame V band) continuum luminosity, that is not
directly dependent on jet interactions with the super-Kpc-scale environment. We
show that the use of R$_V$, rather than R, results in significantly improved
inverse correlations with the beaming angle as deduced from apparent
superluminal velocities and inverse Compton scattered X-ray emission, and with
the FWHM of quasars' broad H$\beta$ emission line. We discuss some implications
and applications of the new parameter.

A likely background RR Lyr variable and two foreground contact binaries were
also found in the cluster field. The reddening of Ruprecht 106 is estimated at
E(B-V)=0.20 based on the (B-V) colors exhibited by the cluster RR Lyr variables
at minimum light. Analysis of the ""period"" versus ""amplitude"" and ""period""
versus ""rise-time"" diagrams suggests similar metallicities of Ruprecht 106 and

branch of Ruprecht 106. Its position relative to the horizontal branch is
consistent with a cluster metallicity of [Fe/H]>= -1.6.

infinite regions separated by an equal number of boundary curves where the free
energy is non-analytic; (ii) these curves extend from the origin to complex

results and the number of arcs of zeros protruding into the FM phase in our
recent calculation of partition function zeros for the 2D spin $s$ Ising model.

supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. We focus on models for which gauge-neutral
matter couples to the gauge bosons only through nonminimal gauge kinetic terms,
for the cases of one and several condensing gauge groups. Using only symmetry
arguments, the low-energy expansion, and general properties of supersymmetry,
we compute the low energy Wilson action, as well as the (2PI) effective action
for the composite {\it classical} superfield $U\equiv\langle \Tr\WW \rangle$,
with $W_\alpha$ the supersymmetric gauge field strength. The 2PI effective
action provides a firmer foundation for the approach of Veneziano and
Yankielowicz, who treated the composite superfield, $U$, as a quantum degree of
freedom. We show how to rederive the Wilson action by minimizing the 2PI action
with respect to $U$. We determine, in both formulations and for global and
local supersymmetry, the effective superpotential, $W$, the non-perturbative
contributions to the low-energy K\""ahler potential $K$, and the leading higher
supercovariant derivative terms in an expansion in inverse powers of the
condensation scale. As an application of our results we include the string
moduli dependence of the super- and K\""ahler potentials for simple orbifold
models.
