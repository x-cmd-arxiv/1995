relationship generalizes one between commutative algebras and Lie algebras

show that the cohomology of one moduli space is the graph complex decorated
with the cohomology of the other, which in its turn generalizes Getzler's
result for the genus zero moduli. We also show that a certain class of algebras
over the chain operad of compactified moduli spaces has a natural structure of
a commutative homotopy algebra. This may be regarded as a lifting of the dot
product of Lian-Zuckerman's BV algebra structure to the cochain level, thus
complementing the results of an earlier paper hep-th/9307114 of the authors

variability as simulated in the GFDL coupled ocean-atmosphere general
circulation model is established for a set of ensemble experiments. The
ensembles consist of identical oceanic initial conditions underneath a model
atmosphere chosen randomly from the model climatology. This experimental design
is based on the separation in time scales present in the model which motivates
the assumption that the predictability deduced from these ensembles provides an
upper limit to the model's THC predictability. The climatology is taken from a
multi-century model integration whose THC variability has power concentrated at
the 40-60 year time scale. A linear stochastic perspective is shown to be
generally consistent with the ensemble statistics. The linear theory suggests a
natural measure of ensemble predictability as the time at which the ensemble
variance becomes a subjectively defined fraction (0.5 used here) of the
climatological variance. It is furthermore of interest to distinguish
predictability of the rapidly de-correlating portion of the model's THC from
the longer time correlated portion. The rapidly de-correlating portion shows
predictability for $\approx 1.5$ years. The slower portion shows predictability
for $\approx 5-7$ years. The linear stochastic framework provides for the
straightforward construction of an optimal forecast of the model's THC
variability and an understanding of why the optimal forecast is useless beyond
a particular limit.

we can write a kind of double-dispersion relation for the amplitude required to

the Weinberg sum rules for heavy meson matrix elements valid to leading order

Ayo can be identified with the problem of finding winning positions in the

stone winning positions is determined. Given $n$ pits, the number of stones in
a winning position is found to be asymptotically bounded by $n^{2}/\pi$.

and the two-pion propagator in a hot pion gas. These quantities are used to
selfconsistently calculate the in-medium $\pi\pi$ amplitude beyond the
quasiparticle approximation (QPA). The results are shown to differ
significantly from QPA-based calculations. We also examine the impact of chiral
constraints on the $\pi\pi$ interaction in a chirally improved version of the
J\""ulich $\pi\pi$ model.

interactions of fast partons are included. With this input, the excess pion
contribution improves the description of data for both reactions.

paradoxes do not work in quantum information theory. Since quantum information
can exist as a coherent superposition of the classical ``yes'' and ``no''
states, certain tasks which are not conceivable in the classical setting can be
performed in the quantum setting. Classical logical inconsistencies do not
arise, since there exist fixed point states of the diagonalization operator. In
particular, closed timelike curves need not be eliminated in the quantum
setting, since they would not lead to any paradoxical outcome controllability.
Quantum information theory can also be subjected to the treatment of
inconsistent information in databases and expert systems. It is suggested that
any two pieces of contradicting information are stored and processed as
coherent superposition. In order to be tractable, this strategy requires
quantum computation.
