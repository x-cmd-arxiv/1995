spin-glass model (the spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model). All the spins
in the system are coupled by pairs via a random interaction matrix taken from
the Gaussian ensemble. One finds that for a general initial configuration the
system never reaches an equilibrium state and the theorems associated to
`equilibrium dynamics' are violated. Only very particular initial conditions
drive the system to equilibrium. The weak ergodicity breaking scenario is
demonstrated for general `non-equilibrium' initial conditions. Two-time
quantities such as the auto-correlation function explicitly depend on both
times. When the time difference is short compared to the smaller time one finds
stationary dynamics with time translation invariance and the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem satisfied. Instead, when the time difference is
of the order of the smaller time one finds non-stationary dynamics with aging
phenomena, the system {\em remembers} the time spent after the initial time
(the quench below the critical temperature). Interestingly enough the short
time-difference dynamics (FDT regime) for non-equilibrium initial conditions is
identical to the relaxation within the equilibrium states obtained for the
particular `equilibrium' initial conditions. This points to a self-similaririty
of the energy landascape. In addition we analyse the effect of temperature
variations on the behaviour of the correlation function and energy density. In
this way we are able to make some comparisons between experimentally observed
results and exact calculations for the model. Somewhat surprisingly, this
simple model captures some of the effects seen in laboratory spin-glasses.

express the variation of these bounds over the SSM parameter space with a
numerical coefficient, $c$. I also find that in the SSM, a reasonable value of

models, heavy thresholds and gravitational effects will modify this result.

realistic models contain many unknown parameters in practice. I illustrate this
point with minimal supersymmetric $SU(5)$ where the combined constraints of

two-dimensional dilaton gravity is zero through the Hamiltonian constraint
analysis. This implies that the local space-time dependent physical excitations
do not exist. From the linear perturbation around the black hole background, we
explicitly prove that the exponentially growing mode with time is in fact
eliminated outside the horizon. Therefore, the two-dimensional dilation gravity
is essentially stable.

generalizing the known expression of the ADM energy. We show that our
definition of the Bondi energy is exactly the ADM energy minus the radiation
energy at null infinity. An explicit calculation is done for the evaporating
black hole in the RST model with the Strominger's ghost decoupling term. It is
shown that the infalling matter energy is completely recovered through the
Hawking radiation and the thunderpop.

"math/9502229",,"Hans J. Haubold, Arak Mathai Mathai","Solar structure in terms of Gauss' hypergeometric function",,,,"OP-SF 18 Feb 1995","math.CA astro-ph",,"  Hydrostatic equilibrium and energy conservation determine the conditions in
the gravitationally stabilized solar fusion reactor. We assume a matter density
distribution varying non-linearly through the central region of the Sun. The
analytic solutions of the differential equations of mass conservation,
hydrostatic equilibrium, and energy conservation, together with the equation of
state of the perfect gas and a nuclear energy generation rate
$\epsilon=\epsilon_0 \rho^nT^m$, are given in terms of Gauss' hypergeometric
function. This model for the structure of the Sun gives the run of density,
mass, pressure, temperature, and nuclear energy generation through the central
region of the Sun. Because of the assumption of a matter density distribution,
the conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium and energy conservation are separated
from the mode of energy transport in the Sun.

perspective of a ghost field introduced by Einstein. The concepts of ghost
field, hidden variables, local reality and the Bell inequality are reviewed. In
the framework of the correlated singlet state, it is shown that quantum
mechanics can be cast in a way that has the form of either nonpositive and
local ghost field or a positive and nonlocal ghost field.
