the THC variability in the coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM of Delworth, Manabe,

dominant mean state under mixed boundary conditions. A linear stability
analysis of this state reveals one damped oscillatory THC mode in addition to
purely damped modes. The variability of the model under a moderate amount of
stochastic forcing, meant to emulate the random variability of the atmosphere
affecting the coupled model's interdecadal THC variability, is studied. A
linear interpretation, in which the damped oscillatory mode is of primary
importance, is sufficient for understanding the mechanism accounting for the
stochastically forced variability. Direct comparison of the variability in the
box model and coupled GCM reveals common qualitative aspects. Such a comparison
supports, although does not verify, the hypothesis that the coupled model's THC
variability can be interpreted as the result of atmospheric weather exciting a
linear damped oscillatory THC mode.

in isolated elliptical galaxies. Dust grains are ejected into galactic-scale
cooling flows in large ellipticals by normal mass loss from evolving red
giants. Newly introduced dust rapidly enters the hot gas environment and is
sputtered away by thermal collisions with ions. Before the grains are
completely sputtered away, they emit prodigious amounts of infrared radiation
which may contribute to the large far infrared luminosities observed in
ellipticals. In order to study the global properties of grains in ellipticals
we construct a new series of King-type galactic models which are consistent
with the fundamental plane, galactic mass to light ratios and other relevant
observational correlations. We describe a new ``continuity'' procedure to
construct simple time-dependent gas dynamic models for cooling flows. In all
galaxy models, although grains can flow a considerable distance from their
radius of origin before being sputtered away, the grain size distribution is
accurately determined by assuming {\it in situ} sputtering, completely ignoring
advection. The dominant source of grain heating is absorption of starlight;
grain heating by collisions with energetic thermal electrons or X-ray
absorption are negligible. However, we also show that when self-consistent
grain sputtering is included the dust-to-gas ratio is reduced and radiative
cooling, not electron-grain interactions dominates plasma cooling, even for the
most massive ellipticals.

fluxes are then decomposed according to the final state of the atom and the
notion of conditional flux is introduced. This notion is generalized so as to
study the energy content of the vacuum fluctuations that induce the transitions
of the accelerated atom. The physical relevance of these conditional fluxes is
displayed and contact is made with the formalism of Aharonov et al. The same
decomposition is then applied to isolate, in the context of black hole

converted into on mass shell quanta. It is shown that initially these
fluctuations are located around the light like geodesic that shall generate the
horizon and have exponentially large energy densities. Upon exiting from the

an on mass shell quantum, the other, its ''partner"", ends up in the

instance, rule out primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate. We here
point out that these bounds can, in principle, be improved by studying the
diffuse cosmic neutrino flux. Measurements of near-vertical atmospheric
neutrino fluxes in a region of low geomagnetic latitude can provide a
competitive bound. The most favorable energy to detect a possible diffuse flux
of primordial black hole origin is found to be a few MeV. We also show that
measurements of the diffuse $\nu _\tau$ flux is the most promising to improve
the existing bounds deduced from gamma-ray measurements. Neutrinos from

The integrals of polarized distributions are discussed and compared with the
corresponding quantities obtained from neutron and hyperon $\beta$-decay data.
We use the combination of proton and neutron spin asymmetries in order to
determine the coefficients of our polarized quark distributions. Our fit shows
that phenomenologically there is no need for taking gluonic degrees of freedom
into account.

topologically massive Chern-Simons theory in which the gauge fields are
minimally coupled to a multiplet of scalar fields in such a way that the gauge
symmetry is spontaneously broken. Such a model produces the Chern-Simons-Higgs
mechanism in which the gauge excitations acquire mass both from the
Chern-Simons term and from the Higgs-Kibble effect. The symmetry breaking is
chosen to be only partially broken, in such a way that in the broken vacuum
there remains a residual non-Abelian symmetry. We develop the canonical
operator structure of this theory in the broken vacuum, with particular
emphasis on the particle-content of the fields involved in the
Chern-Simons-Higgs mechanism. We construct the Fock space and express the
dynamical generators in terms of creation and annihilation operator modes. The
canonical apparatus is used to obtain the propagators for this theory, and we
use the Poincar\'e generators to demonstrate the effect of Lorentz boosts on
the particle states.

We derive these equations using the properties of the vertex operators and the
boundary vacuum state, or alternatively through corner transfer matrix
arguments for the 8-vertex model with a boundary. The spontaneous boundary
magnetization is found by solving such difference equations. The boundary
$S$-matrix is also proposed and compared, in the sine-Gordon limit, with
Ghoshal--Zamolodchikov's result. The axioms satisfied by the form factors in

the (\pi^+ ,\pi^- ) double charge exchange cross--sections on nuclei. We
investigate the six--quark system with these quantum--numbers within the
constituent quark model, with linear confinement, effective one--gluon exchange
at short range and chiral interactions between quarks (\pi and \sigma
exchange). We classify all possible six quark states with J^P=0^-,T=0, and with
N=1 and N=3 harmonic oscillator excitations, using different reduction chains.
The six--quark Hamiltonian is diagonalized in the basis including the unique
N=1 state and the 10 most important states from the N=3 shell. We find, that
with most of the possible sets of parameters, the mass of such a ""dibaryon""
lies above the N(939)+N^\ast(1535) threshold. The only possibility to describe
the supposed d'(2065) in the present context is to reduce the confinement
strength to very small values, however at the expense of describing the
negative parity resonances N^\ast. We also analyze the J^P=0^-,T=2,N=1
six--quark state.

scattering by providing a link between the string model approach and a thermal

in energy density. Regions of high energy density are considered to be quark
matter droplets and treated macroscopically. At SPS energies, we find mainly
medium size droplets --- with energies up to few tens of GeV. A key issue is
the microcanonical treatment of individual quark matter droplets. Each droplet
hadronizes instantaneously according to the available n-body phase space. Due
to the huge number of possible hadron configurations, special Monte Carlo
techniques have been developed to calculate this disintegration. We present
results concerning the production of strange particles from such a
hadronization as compared to string decay.

$1/\sqrt{-\epsilon}$ where $\epsilon \equiv \Delta T / \Delta T_c -1$. The
noise power necessary to explain the measurements agrees with the prediction
for thermal noise. (WAC95-1)
