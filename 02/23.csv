determine cluster gas masses out to radii between 1 and $3\Mpc$, and to confirm
the apparent conflict, if $\Omega_0=1$, between the current calculations of the
mean baryon fraction of the Universe expected from standard primordial
nucleosynthesis, and the fraction of the mass in clusters which is in gas. Our
analysis shows that baryon overdensities in clusters are much more widespread
than only the Coma cluster with which S.~White \& Frenk originally highlighted
this problem. The uncertainties involved in our analysis and some cosmological
implications from our results are briefly discussed. For a refined sample of 13
clusters we find that the baryon fraction for the gas within $1\Mpc$ lies
between 10 and 22 per cent.

which are close to quadratic. As a testcase, the method is applied on the
Kalnajs disks. The results obtained are in full agreement with the analytical

independence of the mathematical complexity of the unperturbed distribution,
the degree of detail with which the solutions can be calculated and its
computational straightforwardness. On the contrary, power series solutions are
not suitable for describing regions where resonant orbits occur, which we
therefore exclude in this paper. We used the technique to analyse perturbations
in the central regions of a galaxy, tracking the dynamical consequences of a

driving system is regular and completely predictable. A small feedback of
strength $\epsilon$ still allows a good forecasting in the driving system up to
a very long time $T_p \sim \epsilon^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ depends on the
details of the system. The most interesting situation happens when the Lyapunov
exponent of the total system is strongly chaotic with $\lambda_{tot} \approx
\lambda_0$ , practically independent of $\epsilon$. Therefore an exponential
amplification of a small incertitude on the initial conditions in the driving
system for any $\epsilon \neq 0$ coexists with very long predictability times.
The paradox stems from saturation effects in the evolution for the growth of
the incertitude as illustrated in a simple model of coupled maps and in a
system of three point vortices in a disk.

behaviour is more complicated, possibly because of thermal excitation of
surface modes. For nuclei, the FWHM shows strong shell-structure-linked
oscillations across the periodic table. Focussing on the lower envelope of the
oscillations (magic nuclei), the downward trend of the FWHM is consistent with
the radius$^{-1}$ variation. A schematic theoretical description of the
systematics in nuclei is presented. If the FWHMs are scaled by the respective

background of a collapsing star requires transplanckian energy fluctuations.
These fluctuations are encoded in the weak values of the energy-momentum
operator constructed from matrix elements between both -in and -out states. It
is argued that taming of these weak values by back-reaction may lead to
geometrical backgrounds which are also build from weak values of the
gravitational field operators. This leads to different causal histories of the
black hole as reconstructed by observers crossing the horizon at different
times but reduces, in accordance with the equivalence principle, to the
classical description of the collapse for the proper history of the star as
recorded by an observer comoving with it. For observers never crossing the
horizon, the evaporation would be interpreted within a topologically trivial
``achronon geometry"" void of horizon and singularity: after the initial
ignition of the radiation from pair creation out of the vacuum of the
collapsing star of mass M, as in the conventional theory, the source of the
thermal radiation would shift gradually to the star itself in a time at least
of order $4M\ln 2M$. The burning of the star could be consistent with a quantum
unitary evolution along the lines suggested by 't Hooft. A provisional formal
expression of general black hole complementarity is proposed and its possible
relevance for testing features of a theory of quantum gravity is suggested.

reflect in the bosonic world, if it happens that all new degrees of freedom are
too heavy to be directly produced in the future colliders. Five of these
operators are CP conserving and the remaining ones are CP violating. We derive
the unitarity constraints for the CP violating operators and compare them with
the already known constraints for the CP conserving ones. Dynamical
renormalizable models are also presented, which partly elucidate what the
appearance of each of these operators can teach us on the mechanism of
spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking.

the large N limit of this expansion. The relationship to the usual matrix model
resolvent is elucidated. Our methods give as a by-product an extremely simple
derivation of the Migdal integral equation describing the large $N$ limit of
the Itzykson-Zuber formula. We illustrate and check our methods by analyzing a
number of models solvable by traditional means. We then proceed to solve a new
model: a sum over planar graphs possessing even coordination numbers on both
the original and the dual lattice. We conclude by formulating equations for the
case of arbitrary sets of even, self-dual coupling constants. This opens the
way for studying the deep problem of phase transitions from random to flat
lattices.

dimensions greater than one), and also compare qualitatively with many
anomalous transport features of the high-T$_c$ cuprates. This anomalous
behavior of the normal-state properties is traced to a ``collective single-band
Kondo effect,'' in which a quasiparticle resonance forms at the Fermi level as
the temperature is lowered, ultimately yielding a strongly renormalized Fermi
liquid at zero temperature.
