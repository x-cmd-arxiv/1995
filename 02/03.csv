T$_{\rm eff}$'s and surface gravities (log$\,g$) of a group of TTS. This method
is based on the comparison between observed and theoretical molecular and
atomic line depth ratios being therefore insensitive to the influence of
veiling. We show the strong dependence of our line depth ratios upon gravity
and temperature. The resulting gravities, as expected for TTS, average between
the values of dwarf and giant stars. Previously published gravities for each of
our stars vary widely due in part to the differences in the adopted visual
extinction, veiling (if ever considered) and methods of assessing the stellar
luminosity. Our values of T$_{\rm eff}$ and log$\,g$ have the uniqueness of
being entirely derived from high resolution data and are not affected by
circumstellar extinction or veiling when line ratios are used. They therefore
serve as more reliable input parameters for future spectral synthesis analyses
of T Tauri Stars requiring model atmospheres. We provide a table relating
theoretical line depth ratio with T$_{\rm eff}$ and log $\,g$ for easy

thin and optically thick equilibria, while the other two types are
distinguished by whether advection is negligible or dominant. A stable
Shakura-Sunyaev disk exists only for accretion rates $\dot M$ below a certain
maximum. However, there is a critical viscosity parameter $\alpha_{\rm crit}$,
which is a function of radius, such that for $\alpha>\alpha_{\rm crit}$
advection-dominated solutions exist for all $\dot M$. Even when $\alpha<
\alpha_{\rm crit}$, the advection-dominated solutions are available for a wide
range of $\dot M$ except for a gap around the Eddington rate. We therefore
suggest that advection-dominated flows may be more common than standard thin
disks in black hole systems. For certain ranges of radii and $\dot M$, no
stable steady state solution is possible. In these cases, we suggest that limit
cycle behavior may occur, leading to variability.

undergenerate. Undergeneration can be tackled either by sentence correction, or
by grammar correction. This thesis concentrates upon automatic grammar
correction (or machine learning of grammar) as a solution to the problem of
undergeneration. Broadly speaking, grammar correction approaches can be
classified as being either {\it data-driven}, or {\it model-based}. Data-driven
learners use data-intensive methods to acquire grammar. They typically use
grammar formalisms unsuited to the needs of practical text processing and
cannot guarantee that the resulting grammar is adequate for subsequent semantic
interpretation. That is, data-driven learners acquire grammars that generate
strings that humans would judge to be grammatically ill-formed (they {\it
overgenerate}) and fail to assign linguistically plausible parses. Model-based
learners are knowledge-intensive and are reliant for success upon the
completeness of a {\it model of grammaticality}. But in practice, the model
will be incomplete. Given that in this thesis we deal with undergeneration by
learning, we hypothesise that the combined use of data-driven and model-based
learning would allow data-driven learning to compensate for model-based
learning's incompleteness, whilst model-based learning would compensate for
data-driven learning's unsoundness. We describe a system that we have used to
test the hypothesis empirically. The system combines data-driven and
model-based learning to acquire unification-based grammars that are more
suitable for practical text parsing. Using the Spoken English Corpus as data,
and by quantitatively measuring undergeneration, overgeneration and parse
plausibility, we show that this hypothesis is correct.

staggered fermions the one-loop fermionic corrections to the spatial and
temporal plaquette couplings as well as the leading $Z_N$ symmetry breaking
coupling. A. Hasenfratz and T. DeGrand have shown that $\beta_c$ for dynamical
staggered fermions can be accurately estimated by the formula $\beta_c =
\beta^{\rm pure}_c - \Delta\beta_F$ where $\Delta\beta_F$ is the shift induced
by the fermions at zero temperature. Numerical and analytical results indicate
that the finite temperature corrections to the zero-temperature calculation of
A. Hasenfratz and T. DeGrand are small for small values of $\kappa = {1\over
2m_F}$, but become significant for intermediate values of $\kappa$. The effect
of these finite temperature corrections is to ruin the agreement of the
Hasenfratz-DeGrand calculation with Monte Carlo data. We argue, however, that
the finite temperature corrections are suppressed nonperturbatively at low
temperatures, resolving this apparent disagreement. The $Z_N$ symmetry breaking
coupling is small; we argue that it changes the order of the transition while
having little effect on the critical value of $\beta$.

the second viscosity in hydrodynamics. The problem can be considered
analytically in the continuum approximation, and the analysis produces an
explicit relation between the SW's velocity and the densities of the two

that a stable SW establishes if the initial velocity is directed towards the
less dense phase; in the opposite case, the wave gradually spreads out. The
numerically found equilibrium velocity of the SW turns out to be in a very good
agreement with the analytical formula even in a strongly discrete case. If the
initial velocity is essentially different from the one determined by the
