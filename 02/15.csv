The outflow from a traffic jam self-organizes to a critical state of maximum
throughput. Small perturbations of the outflow far downstream create emergent
traffic jams with a power law distribution $P(t) \sim t^{-3/2}$ of lifetimes,
$t$. On varying the vehicle density in a closed system, this critical state
separates lamellar and jammed regimes, and exhibits $1/f$ noise in the power
spectrum. Using random walk arguments, in conjunction with a cascade equation,
we develop a phenomenological theory that predicts the critical exponents for
this transition and explains the self-organizing behavior. These predictions
are consistent with all of our numerical results.

rotation for the bar in the SB0 galaxy NGC 936. With this technique, the bar's
pattern speed, Omega_p, can be derived from the luminosity and
stellar-kinematic information in long-slit spectral observations taken parallel
to the major axis of the galaxy. The kinematic measurement required is the mean
line-of-sight velocity of all stellar light entering the slit. This quantity
can only be calculated reliably if any asymmetry in the shape of the broadening
function of the spectral lines is also measured, and so we present a method
which allows for such asymmetry. The technique also returns a true measure of
the RMS uncertainty in the estimate. Application of the analysis to a set of
long-slit spectra of NGC 936 returns four separate measures of Omega_p which
are mutually consistent. Combining these data produces a best estimate for the
bar pattern speed of Omega_p = 60 +/- 14 km/s/kpc (assuming a distance of 16.6
Mpc). This result refines the only previous attempt to make this measurement,
which yielded an estimate for Omega_p in NGC 936 of 104 +/- 37 km/s/kpc (Kent
1987). The new measurement places the co-rotation radius just beyond the end of
the bar, in agreement with theoretical calculations.

radiative transfer. Both the dynamics and IR spectrum of the solution are fully
characterized by the flux averaged optical depth. Five types of dust grains are
considered: astronomical silicate, SiC, crystalline olivine, graphite and
amorphous carbon as well as mixtures. Analysis of infrared signatures provides
constraints on the grain chemical composition and indications for the
simultaneous existence of silicate and carbon grains. The region of parameter
space where radiation pressure can support a given mass-loss rate is identified
and a new method to derive mass loss rates from IR data is presented. IRAS LRS
classes are associated with optical depth for various grain materials and the
regions of color-color diagrams expected to be populated by late-type stars are
identified. We show that cirrus emission can severely affect point source
measurements to the extent that their listed IRAS long wavelength fluxes are
unreliable. After accounting for cirrus contamination, essentially all IRAS
point sources located in the relevant regions of the color-color diagrams can
be explained as late-type stars.

for $p < 4$ the traditional RG flows at dimensions $D=4-\epsilon$, which are
usually considered as describing the disorder-induced universal critical
behavior, are unstable with respect to the RSB potentials as found in spin
glasses. It is demonstrated that for a general type of the Parisi RSB
structures there exists no stable fixed points, and the RG flows lead to the
{\it strong coupling regime} at the finite scale $R_{*} \sim \exp(1/u)$, where
$u$ is the small parameter describing the disorder. The physical concequences

quark model with the sigma-meson degrees of freedom. Possible experiments are
proposed to produce the elusive meson in a nucleus and detect it. In relation
to a precursory soft mode for the chiral transition, the reason is clarified
why the dynamic properties of the superconductor may be described by the
diffusive time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation. We indicate the
chiral symmetry plays a significant role also in nuclei; one may say that the
stability of nuclei is due to the chiral symmetry of QCD.

$m_{\nu_e}\approx m_{\nu_\tau}\approx 2.5\,\eV$ and $m_{\nu_\mu}\approx0$ so
that cosmology can benefit from a recently proposed ``cold plus hot dark
matter'' structure formation scenario with two equal mass light neutrinos
(C$\nu^2$DM). Solar neutrino oscillations ($\nu_e\to\nu_\tau$) can occur with
one of the large mixing angle solutions so that a serious conflict with
$\beta\beta$ decay Majorana mass limits is avoided without invoking Dirac
masses. However, there is a problem with the SN~1987A signal because of
resonant $\anti\nu_e\leftrightarrow\anti\nu_\mu$ oscillations which are
expected to cause far higher $\anti\nu_e$ energies at the IMB and Kamiokande~II
detectors than have been observed. A small value $\Delta m^2=0.5\,\eV^2$ at
LSND, which allows for a relatively large $\nu_e$-$\nu_\mu$ mixing angle
without conflicting with the KARMEN and BNL-E776 experiments, would indicate
$m_{\nu_e}\approx m_{\nu_\tau}\approx 1.62\,\eV$ and
$m_{\nu_\mu}\approx1.77\,\eV$. This scheme of C$\nu^3$DM maintains, and even
may improve, the essential cosmological model implications for large-scale
structure, leaving no conflict with SN r-process nucleosynthesis. It may
improve the discordance between the SN~1987A neutrino spectra inferred from

ordinary substructure played the role of <=. Working with a cardinal lambda
satisfying lambda^{< lambda}= lambda guarantees appropriate downward
Lowenheim-Skolem theorems; the existence and uniqueness of a

property. We make this apparent dependence more precise in this paper. The
major innovation of this paper is the introduction of weaker notion to replace
the natural notion of (K, <=)-homogeneous-universal model. Modulo a weak
extension of ZFC (provable if V=L), we show that a class K obeying certain
minimal restrictions satisfies a fundamental dichotomy: For arbitrarily large
lambda, either K has the maximal number of models in power lambda or K has a
unique chain homogenous-universal model of power lambda. We show that in a
