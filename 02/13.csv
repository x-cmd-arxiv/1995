Hot Dark Matter (CHDM) cosmologies. We discuss the power spectrum and
correlation functions in real and redshift space, with comparisons to the CfA2
and IRAS redshift data, the pairwise velocity of galaxies, and the distribution
of hot and cold particles in CHDM simulations. We confirm that CHDM with
cold/hot/baryon density ratios $\Omega_c/\Omega_\nu/\Omega_b= 0.6/0.3/0.1$ is a
good fit to a wide variety of present-epoch data, much better than CDM. In
particular, with reasonable assumptions about identification of galaxies and
biasing, we find that the power spectrum agrees rather well with both the CfA2
and IRAS power specta in both the nonlinear and linear regimes. New CHDM models
(e.g., with $\Omega_\nu=0.2$ or with two massive neutrinos) predict a
significantly larger rate of formation of galaxies at high redshift, which may
be needed to explain some observational data. At the same time, the difference
between the variants is rather small at $z=0$. The results presented in this
paper are interesting for two purposes: (i) For a comparison with other classes
of models (like CDM and $\Lambda$CDM) at $z=0$.(ii) As a reference point for
comparison between different variants of the CHDM model.

calculate the evolution under gravitational instability of the underdense
regions of a photoionized intergalactic medium (IGM). We find that over most of
the spectrum of a quasar, the optical depth to $\lya$ scattering originates
from gas in underdense regions, or voids. This causes the ratio of the median
Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption to the value for a uniform medium containing all
the baryons in the universe to be very small, and to decrease as gravitational
collapse proceeds. We apply our calculations to the observations of the
intensity distribution in a $z=4.11$ quasar by Webb and coworkers. We show that
if $\lya$ clouds arise from gravitational collapse, their observations must be
interpreted as the first detection of the (fluctuating) GP effect, with a
median value $\tau_{GP}\simeq 0.06$ at $z=4$. For typical low-density
($\Omega\sim 0.4$) cosmological models, this is consistent with the predicted
baryon density from primordial nucleosynthesis, and the intensity of the
ionizing background derived from the proximity effect. From the numerical
simulations of Cen \etal, such models also predict correctly the number of
$\lya$ absorption lines observed.

all values of external flux. However, the general behavior of phase-locking is
found to be just contrary to that according to weak coupling. In case of strong
coupling there is nearly no influence of external magnetic flux on the phases,
but the locking-frequency becomes flux-dependent. The influence of parameter
splitting is considered as well as the effect of small capacitive shunting of

on-site energies are pairwise correlated (dimers). We observe a red shift and a
broadening of the absorption line on increasing the width of the Gaussian
distribution. In the two cases we find that the shift is the same, within our
numerical accuracy, whereas the broadening is larger when dimers are
introduced. The increase of the width of the Gaussian distribution leads to
larger differences between uncorrelated and correlated disordered models. We
suggest that this higher broadening is due to stronger scattering effects from
dimers.

Onsager's Algebra. This infinite-dimensional Lie Algebra is shown to be
isomorphic to a fixed point subalgebra of $ sl(N) $ Loop Algebra with respect
to a certain involution. As the consequence of the generalized Dolan Grady
relations a Hamiltonian linear in the generators of $ sl(N) $ Onsager's Algebra
is shown to posses an infinite number of mutually commuting integrals of
motion.

violate global symmetries. It may lead to many important consequences. We will
argue, in particular, that nonperturbative gravitational effects in the axion
theory lead to a strong violation of CP invariance unless they are suppressed
by an extremely small factor 10^{-82}. One could hope that this problem
disappears if one represents the global symmetry of a pseudoscalar axion field
as a gauge symmetry of the Ogievetsky-Polubarinov-Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric
tensor field. We will show, however, that this gauge symmetry does not protect
the axion mass from quantum corrections. The amplitude of gravitational effects
violating global symmetries could be strongly suppressed by e^{-S}, where S is
the action of a wormhole which may eat the global charge. Unfortunately, in a
wide variety of theories based on the Einstein theory of gravity the action
appears to be fairly small, S = O(10). However, we have found that the
existence of wormholes and the value of their action are extremely sensitive to
the structure of space on the nearly Planckian scale. We consider several
examples (Kaluza-Klein theory, conformal anomaly, R^2 terms) which show that
modifications of the Einstein theory on the length scale l ~ 10 M_P^{-1} may
strongly suppress violation of global symmetries. We have found also that in
string theory there exists an additional suppression of topology change by the
factor e^{-{8\pi^2\over g^2}}. This effect is strong enough to save the axion
theory for the natural values of the stringy gauge coupling constant.

symmetry breaking of the $D$-dimensional Thirring model ($2<D<4$) with $N$
flavors of 4-component fermions. By constructing the gauge covariant effective
potential for the chiral order parameter, up to the leading order of $1/N$
expansion, we show the existence of the second order chiral phase transition
and obtain explicitly the critical number of flavors $N_c$ (resp. critical
four-fermion coupling $G_c$) as a function of the four-fermion coupling $G$
(resp. $N$), below (resp. above) which the chiral symmetry is spontaneously
broken.

recently fostered by inelastic helium atom scattering experiments carried out
by Hulpke and Luedecke. Sharp and giant anomalies in the surface phonon
dispersion curves along Gamma-H and Gamma-S have been detected on W(110) and
Mo(110) at a coverage of one monolayer of hydrogen. At the same critical wave
vectors a smaller second indentation is present in the experimental phonon
branches. Recently we have proposed a possible interpretation which is able to
explain this and other experiments. In this paper we discuss results of our
recent ab initio calculations of the atomic and electronic properties of the
clean and H-covered Mo(110) surface in more details. For the full monolayer
coverage the calculated Fermi-surface contours are characterized by strong
nesting features which originate the observed anomalies.

commutative subalgebra $A(gl_n)$ generated by the centres of all algebras in
the chain $Y(gl_1)\subset Y(gl_2)\subset...\subset Y(gl_N)$. We study the
finite-dimensional $Y(gl_N)$-modules with a semisimple action of the subalgebra
$A(gl_N)$. We call these modules tame.
  We provide a characterization of irreducible tame modules in terms of their
Drinfeld polynomials. We prove that every irreducible tame module splits into a
tensor product of modules corresponding to the skew Young diagrams and some
one-dimensional module.
  The eigenbases of $A(gl_N)$ in irreducible tame modules are called
Gelfand-Zetlin bases. We provide explicit formulas for the action of the
Drinfeld generators of the algebra $Y(gl_N)$ on the vectors of Gelfand-Zetlin
bases.
