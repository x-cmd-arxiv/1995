general type over the complex number field, $K$ the canonical divisor of $X$.
Let $G$ be an abelian group of automorphisms of $X$. Suppose $K$ is nef. Then
there exists a universal constant coefficient $c$ such that $\# G \le c K^3$.

reliability of the radiochemical method for detecting solar neutrinos has been
tested recently by the GALLEX experiment. All efforts to solve the solar

so far. This may also mean that the average solar neutrino flux extracted from
the four experiments may not be the proper quantity to explain the production
of neutrinos in the deep interior of the Sun. Occasionally it has been
emphasized that the solar neutrino flux may vary over time. In this paper we do
address relations among specific neutrino fluxes produced in the proton-proton
chain that are imposed by the coupled systems of non-linear partial
differential equations of solar structure and kinetic equations by focusing our
attention on a statistical interpretation of selected kinetic equation of
PPII/PPIII branch reactions of the proton-proton chain. A fresh look at the
statistical implications for the outcome of kinetic equations for nuclear
reactions may shed light on recent claims that the $^7$Be-neutrino flux of the
Sun is suppressed in comparison to the pp- and $^8$B neutrino fluxes and may
hint at that the solar neutrino flux is indeed varying over time as shown by
the Homestake experiment.

offer the means to determine element abundances in galaxies observed while
still at an early stage of evolution. Such measurements, which have only
recently come within reach, complement and extend the data provided by studies
of different stellar populations in our Galaxy and of extragalactic H~II
regions which have up to now formed the basis of galactic chemical evolution
models. In this paper we demonstrate the potential of this new approach with
high-resolution echelle observations of several elements in the z(abs) =
2.27936 absorption system in the bright z(em) = 2.940 QSO 2348-147. The
absorbing galaxy appears to be chemically unevolved, with heavy element
abundances only 1/100 of solar; if it is the progenitor of a spiral galaxy like
our own, it is unlikely to have collapsed to form a thin disk by z = 2.3
(corresponding to a look-back time of approximately 13 Gyr for H_0 = 50
km/s/Mpc and q_0 = 0.01). Our data allow us to measure the nitrogen-to-oxygen
ratio at a metallicity lower than those of the most metal-poor dwarf galaxies
known. We find that, relative to the solar scale, N is more underabundant than
O by at least a factor of 15. This result is broadly in line with current ideas
on the relative importance of primary and secondary production of N; future
measurements in several damped Lyman alpha systems will permit more stringent
tests of models for the evolution of the N/O ratio with time. Oxygen and other
alpha-elements are overabundant relative to Fe by no more than the factor of
about 3 typical of metal-poor stars in the disk and halo of the Milky Way.

After a brief background setting the cosmological context for this work, the
first part of this review focuses on redshift surveys. The practical issues of
how redshift surveys are carried out, and how one turns a distribution of
galaxies into a smoothed density field, are discussed. Then follows a
description of major redshift surveys that have been done, and the local
cosmography out to 8,000 km/s that they have mapped. We then discuss in some
detail the various quantitative cosmological tests that can be carried out with
redshift data. The second half of this review concentrates on peculiar velocity
studies, beginning with a thorough review of existing techniques. After
discussing the various biases which plague peculiar velocity work, we survey
quantitative analyses done with peculiar velocity surveys alone, and finally
with the combination of data from both redshift and peculiar velocity surveys.
The data presented rule out the standard Cold Dark Matter model, although
several variants of Cold Dark Matter with more power on large scales fare
better. All the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the initial
density field had a Gaussian distribution, although one cannot rule out broad
classes of non-Gaussian models. Comparison of the peculiar velocity and density
fields constrains the Cosmological Density Parameter. The results here are
consistent with a flat universe with mild biasing of the galaxies relative to
dark matter, although open universe models are by no means ruled out.

equations are the equivalent of the Wigner equation and are described by a
system of stochastic differential equations. We present a formula for the
calculation of the expectation value of a quantum operator whose Weyl symbol is
a function of the large-scale inflation scalar field and its time derivative.
The unique solution is obtained for the Cauchy problem for the Wigner equation
for large-scale inflation. The stationary solution for the Wigner equation is
found for an arbitrary potential. It is shown that the large-scale inflation
scalar field in de Sitter space behaves as a quantum one-dimensional
dissipative system, which supports the earlier results. But the analogy with a
one-dimensional model of the quantum linearly damped anharmonic oscillator is
not complete: the difference arises from the new time dependent commutation
relation for the large-scale field and its time derivative. It is found that,
for the large-scale inflation scalar field the large time asymptotics is equal
to the `classical limit'. For the large time limit the quantum Langevin
equations are just the classical stochastic Langevin equations (only the
stationary state is defined by the quantum field theory).

computed eight coefficients grow with the order much faster than predicted by
the presence of the infrared renormalon associated to the dimension of the
gluon condensate. However the renormalon behaviour for large order is quite
well reproduced if one considers the expansion coefficients in a new coupling
related to the lattice coupling by large perturbative corrections. This is
expected since the lattice and continuum Lambda scales differ by almost two
orders of magnitude.

low-energy effective Lagrangian and ii) starting from a random matrix theory

theory can be obtained directly from the random matrix theory. Previously, this
was shown for three or more colors with fundamental fermions. In this paper we
construct the effective theory from a random matrix theory for two colors in
the fundamental representation and for an arbitrary number of colors in the
adjoint representation. We construct a fermionic partition function for
Majorana fermions in Euclidean space time. Their reality condition is
formulated in terms of complex conjugation of the second kind.

Infalling matter forms a black hole if its energy is above a certain threshold.
The black hole singularity is initially hidden behind a timelike apparent
horizon. As the black hole evaporates by emitting Hawking radiation, the
singularity meets the shrinking horizon in finite retarded time to become
naked. A natural boundary condition exists at the naked singularity such that
for general infalling matter-configuration the evaporating black hole
geometries can be matched continuously to a unique static end-state geometry.
This end-state geometry is asymptotically flat at its right spatial infinity,
while its left spatial infinity is a semi-infinite throat extending into the
strong coupling region.

$m \gg 1$ in (2+1) and (1+1) dimensions. Up to the next-to-leading order of
$1/m$, we show that the (2+1)-dimensional massive Thirring model is mapped to
the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory and that the (1+1)-dimensional massive Thirring
model is equivalent to the massive free scalar field theory. In the process of
the bosonization of the Thirring model, we point out the importance of the
gauge-invariant formulation. Finally we discuss a possibility of extending this

of the chiral determinant appearing in the Schwinger model is obtained
exploiting perturbation theory. This calculation poses interesting mathematical
problems, as the Poincar\'e disk is a noncompact manifold with a metric tensor
