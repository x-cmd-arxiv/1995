consistent with a slope $\gamma = -0.8$. This may well provide the $first$

two dimensions for an infinitely large rank group manifold. The energy of the
ground state is explicitly found for the external Noether's fields of an
arbitrary magnitude. At small field we found an inverse logarithmic singularity
in the ground state energy at the mass gap which indicates that at $N=\infty$
the spectrum of the theory contains extended objects rather than pointlike
particles.

have been used to study the static, dynamic and electronic properties of l-Ga
at the temperatures 702 K and 982 K. The simulations use the density-functional
pseudopotential method and the system is maintained on the Born-Oppenheimer
surface by conjugate gradients relaxation. The static structure factor and
radial distribution function of the simulated system agree very closely with
experimental data, but the diffusion coefficient is noticeably lower than
measured values. The long simulations allow us to calculate the dynamical
structure factor $S(q,\omega)$. A sound-wave peak is clearly visible in
$S(q,\omega)$ at small wavevectors, and we present results for the dispersion
curve and hence the sound velocity, which is close to the experimental value.
The electronic density of states is very close to the free-electron form.
Values of the electrical conductivity calculated from Kubo-Greenwood formula
are in satisfactory accord with measured data.

  of the file",,,"Ecole polytechnique preprint CPTH-RR348.0295","q-alg math.QA",,"  The traces of the Murphy operators of the Hecke algebra $H_n(q)$, and of
products of sets of Murphy operators with non-consecutive indices, can be
evaluated by a straightforward recursive procedure. These traces are shown to
determine all the reduced traces in this algebra, which, in turn, determine all
other traces. To illustrate the procedure we obtain the set of reduced traces
for $H_7(q)$ - the lowest order Hecke algebra whose character table has not
hitherto been reported. This is preceded by the presentation of an explicit
algorithm for the reduction of the trace of an arbitrary element of the Hecke
algebra into a linear combination of traces of elements consisting of
appropriately defined disjoint cycles; and of a proof, presented in order to
make the present article reasonably self-contained, that a reduced trace
depends only on the set of lengths of the disjoint cycles that it consists of.

IV-exponent a, for a two-dimensional superconductor is different from the
exponent originally suggested by Ambegaokar et al. The relation between the new
and the old exponent is a=a_AHNS-3. The new scaling behaviour is linked to the
logarithmic vortex interaction and the long range time tail which this gives
rise to. Consequently one may expect that the scaling behavior is generic for
models which have these basic features. The simplest model of this type is the
two-dimensional Coulomb gas model with Langevin dynamics. We here explicitly
verify, through computer simulations, that the IV-characteristics of this model
indeed scales according to the new scaling exponent a. Keywords: vortex,
