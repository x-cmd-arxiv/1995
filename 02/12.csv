Ryne (Los Alamos National Laboratory)","Finding matched rms envelopes in rf linacs: A Hamiltonian approach","10 pages, uuencoded gzipped PostScript (88K)",,,"LA-UR-95-391","acc-phys physics.acc-ph",,"  We present a new method for obtaining matched solutions of the rms envelope
equations. In this approach, the envelope equations are first expressed in
Hamiltonian form. The Hamiltonian defines a nonlinear mapping, $\cal M$, and
for periodic transport systems the fixed points of the one-period map are the
matched envelopes. Expanding the Hamiltonian around a fiducial trajectory one
obtains a linear map, $M$, that describes trajectories (rms envelopes) near the
fiducial trajectory. Using $\cal M$ and $M$ we construct a contraction mapping
that can be used to obtain the matched envelopes. The algorithm is
quadratically convergent. Using the zero-current matched parameters as starting
values, the contraction mapping typically converges in a few to several
iterations. Since our approach uses numerical integration to obtain all the
mappings, it includes the effects of nonidealized, $z$-dependent transverse and
longitudinal focusing fields. We present numerical examples including finding a
matched beam in a quadrupole channel with rf bunchers.

realization of the quenched disorder. This type of perturbation modifies the
energy landscape of the system without adding extensive energy. We exactly
solve the mean-field case, which displays a very similar chaos to that observed
under magnetic field perturbations, and discuss the possible extension of these
results to the case of short-ranged models. It appears that dimension four
plays the role of a specific critical dimension where mean-field theory is
valid. We present numerical simulation results which support our main
conclusions.

of parallel Coulomb-confined quantum wires, based on the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham
density functional theory of inhomogeneous electron systems. We find that the
corresponding transverse energy levels of two parallel wires lock together when
the wires' widths are similar and their separation is not too small. This
energy level locking is an effect of Coulomb interactions and of the the
density of states singularities that are characteristic of quasi-
one-dimensional Fermionic systems. In dissimilar parallel wires level lockings
are much less likely to occur. Energy level locking in similar wires persists
to quite large wire separations, but is gradually suppressed by inter-wire
tunneling when the separation becomes small. Experimental implications of these
theoretical results are discussed.

is studied based on Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) dimensionally continued
black holes. In even dimensions it is found that asymptotically flat and anti
de-Sitter Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes present up to two second order phase
transitions. The case of asymptotically anti-de-Sitter Schwarzschild black
holes present only one critical transition and a minimum of temperature, which
occurs at the transition. Finally, it is shown that phase transitions are
absent in odd dimensions.
