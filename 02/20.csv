Planetary Camera of the Hubble Space Telescope. The high spatial resolution of
this instrument has allowed us to separate the pulsar system from a nearby
background star which has confounded ground-based observations of this system
near optical minimum. Our images limit the temperature of the backside of the
companion to $T \simlt 2800$~K, about a factor of two less than the average
temperature of the side of the companion facing the pulsar, and provide a
marginal detection of the companion at optical minimum. The magnitude of this
detection is consistent with previous work which suggests that the companion
nearly fills its Roche lobe and is supported through tidal dissipation.

formalism should be supplemented by the explicite calculations of the effects
of the analytical continuation. We present the estimates of the order
$O(\alpha^{4}_{s})$ QCD corrections to the Euclidean quantities: the

namely the non-polarized and polarized Bjorken sum rules and to the

quarks, and gluons is constructed which is manifestly gauge invariant. The
interaction Lagrangian has the form of a twist expansion, as typically
encountered in hard processes, and involves derivatives of arbitrary order. The
parameters in the interaction are related with the non-relativistic wave
function, and standard results for $Q\bar{Q}$ inclusive decays and radiative
transitions are shown to be easily recovered. The light-cone gluon momentum
distribution at very small $x$ is calculated and shown to be uniquely
determined by the non-relativistic wave function. The distribution has a part
which goes as $x^{-1}logx$, ie. is more singular than the usually assumed $1/x$
behaviour. The fragmentation function for a virtual gluon to inclusively decay
into an $\eta_c$ or $\eta_b$ is also calculated. We find that the emission of
low momentum gluons makes this process quite sensitive to assumptions about the
binding of heavy quarks in quarkonia.
