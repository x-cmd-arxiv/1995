complete to $K\simeq 17.3$. The optical-to-infrared colours are consistent with
the range expected from synthetic galaxy spectra, although there are some cases
of very red nuclei. Our data show no evidence for evolution of the $K$-band
luminosity function at $z<0.5$, and the results are well described by a
Schechter function with $M_K^*=-22.75\pm0.13+5\log_{10}h$ and
$\phi^*=0.026\pm0.003 h^3 {\rm Mpc^{-3}}$. This is a somewhat higher
normalization than has been found by previous workers, and it removes much of
the excess in faint $K$ and $B$ counts with respect to a no-evolution model.
However, we do find evidence for evolution at $z>0.5$: $M_K^*$ is approximately
0.75 mag. brighter at $z=1$. This luminosity evolution is balanced by a reduced
normalization at high redshift. The overall evolution is thus opposite to that
expected in simple merger-dominated models.

due to a sink site for the dimer and the trimer with chain configuration by a
numerical integration of the discrete nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Our
results for the dimer show, that the formation of a self trapped state due to
the nonlinear coupling increases the life time of the exciton substantially.
Self trapping can be enhanced by the sink for short times, but for long times
it disappears. In the trimer consisting of a subdimer extended by a sink site
exists a transition between states localized on the two sites of the subdimer
before for larger nonlinear coupling self trapping on one site of the subdimer
is observed. For large trapping rates the fear of death effect leads to an
increasing life time of the excitation on both, the dimer and the trimer. The
sink site is then effectively decoupled. We explain this effect using an
asymptotic theory for strong trapping and demonstrate it by direct numerical
computation.

phase space of the system is generally of a mixed type: Above bifurcation chaos
develops starting from the region of the hyperbolic state and spreading with
increasing energy over the Bloch sphere leaving only islands of regular
dynamics. The behaviour of the polarization oscillator accordingly changes from
regular to chaotic.

increase by less than 16 percent.
