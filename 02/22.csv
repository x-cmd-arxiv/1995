to at least the optical radius, and have high and homogeneus radial data
coverage; they rival with the best optical one-slit RCs available in the
literature and are ideally suited for detailed mass structure modelling. The
820 fair RCs do not meet at least one of the above criteria and hence are not
suitable for direct mass modelling; however, they constitute a large database
for methods aiming to recover statistical properties of DM. For these 900 RCs
we also present, in figures and tables, the rotation curves smoothed on scales
corresponding to 5%-20% of the optical size. By size, homogeneity, intrinsic
quality, and spanned range of luminosities and asymptotic velocities, this

will offer a unique opportunity for investigating in considerable depth the

theory at small $H$ and numerically over a large range of $H$. We obtain the
spin density profile by fixing the spins at opposite ends of the chain to have
opposite signs of $S_z$. One dimension is special in that there the quantum
width of the wall is proportional to the size $L$ of the system. We also study
the quantitative features of the `particle' band which extends up to energies
of order $H$ above the ground state. Except for the planar limit, this particle
band is well separated from excitations having energy $J/S$ involving creation
of more walls. At large $S$ this particle band develops energy gaps and the
lowest sub-band has tunnel splittings of order $H2^{1-2S}$. This scale of
energy gives rise to anomalous scaling with respect to a) finite size, b)
temperature, or c) random potentials. The intrinsic width of the domain wall
and the pinning energy are also defined and calculated in certain limiting
cases. The general conclusion is that quantum effects prevent the wall from
being sharp and in higher dimension would prevent sudden excursions in the

interacting fermions in arbitrary dimension $d$ beyond the Gaussian
approximation. Even in $d=1$ the finite curvature of the energy dispersion at
the Fermi surface gives rise to interactions between the bosons. In higher
dimensions scattering processes describing momentum transfer between different
patches on the Fermi surface (around-the-corner processes) are an additional
source for corrections to the Gaussian approximation. We derive an explicit
expression for the leading correction to the bosonized Hamiltonian and the
irreducible self-energy of the bosonic propagator that takes the finite
curvature as well as around-the-corner processes into account. In the special
case that around-the-corner scattering is negligible, we show that the
self-energy correction to the Gaussian propagator is negligible if the
dimensionless quantities $ ( \frac{q_{c} }{ k_{F}} )^d F_{0} [ 1 + F_{0} ]^{-1}
\frac{\mu}{\nu^{\alpha}} | \frac{ \partial \nu^{\alpha} }{ \partial \mu} |$ are
small compared with unity for all patches $\alpha$. Here $q_{c}$ is the cutoff
of the interaction in wave-vector space, $k_{F}$ is the Fermi wave-vector,
$\mu$ is the chemical potential, $F_{0}$ is the usual dimensionless Landau
interaction-parameter, and $\nu^{\alpha} $ is the {\it{local}} density of
states associated with patch $\alpha$. We also show that the well known
cancellation between vertex- and self-energy corrections in one-dimensional
systems, which is responsible for the fact that the random-phase approximation
for the density-density correlation function is exact in $d=1$, exists also in
$d> 1$, provided (1) the interaction cutoff $q_{c}$ is small compared with
$k_{F}$, and (2) the energy dispersion is locally linearized at the Fermi the
Fermi surface. Finally, we suggest a new systematic method to calculate
corrections to the RPA, which is based on the perturbative calculation of the
irreducible bosonic self-energy arising from the non-Gaussian terms of the
bosonized Hamiltonian.

theory. In the Batalin-Fradkin (BF) formalism, the anomaly-canceling
super-Liouville fields are introduced to identify the original second-class
constrained system with a gauge-fixed version of a first-class system. The
BFV-BRST quantization applies to formulate the theory in the most general class
of gauges. A local effective action constructed in the configuration space
contains two super-Liouville actions; one is a noncovariant but local
functional written only in terms of 2D supergravity fields, and the other
contains the super-Liouville fields canceling the super-Weyl anomaly. Auxiliary
fields for the Liouville and the gravity super-multiplets are introduced to
make the BRST algebra close off-shell. Inclusion of them turns out to be
essentially important especially in the super-lightcone gauge-fixing, where the
super-curvature equations ($\dl^3_-g_{++} =\dl^2_-\chi_{++}=0$) are obtained as
a result of BRST invariance of the theory. Our approach reveals the origin of
the graded-SL(2,R) current algebra symmetry in a transparent manner.

the $SU(2)$ model with scalars. New fixed points for the scalar coupling appear
---one of which is IR stable--- being some of them induced by QG. The IR stable
fixed point perturbed by QG leads to a second-order phase transition for the
theory at non-zero temperature. The RG improved effective potential in the
$SU(2)$ theory (which can be considered as the confining phase of the standard
model) is calculated at nonzero temperature and it is shown that its shape is
clearly influenced by QG.

The isomer exhibits an unusual pattern of decay in which the _majority_ of the
flux proceeds directly to states with <K>=0, bypassing available levels of
intermediate K. This severe breakdown of normal K-selection rules in 176W is
compared with recent observations of K-violation in neighboring nuclei, within
the framework of proposed theoretical approaches. The available data on these
K-violating decays seem to have a consistent explanation in models of K-mixing
