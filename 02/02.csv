according to their projected morphologies. This method will be subsequently
used to place constraints on cosmological parameters ($\Omega$ and the power
spectrum of primordial fluctuations on scales at or slightly smaller than that
of clusters) and to test theories of cluster formation. We specifically address
structure that is easily discernible in projection and dynamically important to
the cluster. The method is derived from the two-dimensional multipole expansion
of the projected gravitational potential and yields dimensionless {\it power
ratios} as morphological statistics. If the projected mass profile is used to
characterize the cluster morphology, the power ratios are directly related to
the cluster potential. However, since detailed mass profiles currently exist
for only a few clusters, we use the X-ray--emitting gas as an alternative
tracer of cluster morphology. In this case, the relation of the power ratios to
the potential is qualitatively preserved. We demonstrate the feasibility of the
method by analyzing simulated observations of simple models of X-ray clusters
using the instrument parameters of the ROSAT PSPC. For illustrative purposes,
we apply the method to ROSAT PSPC images of A85, A514, A1750, and A2029. These
clusters, which differ substantially in their X-ray morphologies, are easily
distinguished by their respective power ratios. We discuss the suitability of
this method to address the connection between cluster morphology and cosmology
and to assess whether an individual cluster is sufficiently relaxed for
analysis of its intrinsic shape using hydrostatic methods. Approximately 50
X-ray observations of Abell clusters with the PSPC will be amenable to
morphological analysis using the method of this paper.

  Accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society",,"10.1093/mnras/273.4.1167",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent {\it ASCA} observations confirm the presence of X-ray absorption due
to partially ionized gas in many Seyfert 1 galaxies; the so-called warm
absorber. Constraints on the location of the warm material are presented with
the conclusion that this material lies at radii coincident with, or just
outside, the broad-line region. The stability of this warm material to isobaric
perturbations under the assumptions of thermal and photoionization equilibrium
is also studied. It is shown that there is a remarkably small range of
ionization parameter, $\xi$, for which the warm absorber state is stable. The
robustness of this result to changes in the shape of the primary continuum, the
assumed density and optical depth is investigated. Given the constraints on the
location and the stability properties of the material, several models for the
environments of Seyfert nuclei are discussed. These attempt to explain the
presence of significant amounts of partially ionized material. In particular,
various models of the broad-line region are discussed. The simple two-phase
model of the broad-line region proves to be unsatisfactory. A model of the
broad-line region is presented in which a turbulent, hot intercloud medium is
mechanically heated. Turbulent mixing layers could then give rise to warm
absorption features. Finally, a model is discussed in which the warm absorber
is due to a steady state, radiatively driven outflow.

allows one to dress the propagators, and to change the effective expansion

textures in the grand unified theory framework provide strong motivations for
supersymmetric(SUSY) SO(10) as the theory beyond the standard model. If one
wants to simultaneously solve the strong CP problem via the Peccei-Quinn
mechanism, the most natural way to implement it within the framework of the
SUSY SO(10) model is to have an intermediate scale ($v_{BL}$) (corresponding to
B-L symmetry breaking) around the invisible axion scale of about 10$^{11}$ -
10$^{12}$ GeV. Such a scale is also desirable if $\nu_{\tau}$ is to constitute
the hot dark matter (HDM) of the universe. In this paper, we discuss examples
of superstring inspired SUSY SO(10) models with intermediate scales that are
consistent with the low energy precision measurements of the standard model
gauge couplings. The hypothesis of $b-\tau$ unification which is a successful
prediction of many grand unified theories is then required of these models and
the resulting prediction of $b$-quark mass is used as a measure of viability of
these schemes. Detailed analysis of a model with a $v_{BL}\simeq 10^{11}$ GeV,
which satisfies both the requirements of invisible axion and $\nu_{\tau}$ as
HDM is presented and shown to lead to $m_b\simeq 4.9$ GeV in the one-loop
approximation.

of these lectures is divided into two sections. After briefly sketching the

of neutrino mass generation, including those which are motivated by present
experimental hints from solar and atmospheric neutrinos, as well as
cosmological data on the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations. Then
some of the physics motivations and potential of various extensions of the
standard model related to the electroweak breaking sector, such as
supersymmetry, and extensions of the gauge boson sector are reviewed. The new
signatures associated with both types of extension may all be accessible to
experiments performed either at accelerators or at underground installations.
The complementarity between these two approaches in the search for signals

scattering amplitudes off-meson-mass-shell, but must yield identical S-matrix
elements. We argue that the effective meson mass in nuclear matter obtained
from chiral effective lagrangians is also unique. Off-mass-shell amplitudes
obtained using the PCAC choice of pion field must therefore not be viewed as
fundamental constraints on the dynamics, the determination of the effective
meson mass in nuclear matter or the possible existence of meson condensates in
the ground state of nuclear matter. This hypothesis is borne out by a
calculation of the effective mass in two commonly employed formulations of
chiral perturbation theory which yield different meson-nucleon scattering
amplitudes off-meson-mass-shell.

Our model is a local model with hidden-variables of the EPR-Bohm
Gedankenexperiment. Although there is no dynamical interaction between a pair
of spin-1/2 objects, the model can reproduce approximately the
quantum-mechanical correlations by the coincidence counting. Hence the Bell
inequality is violated. This result supports the idea that the coincidence
counting is the source of the non-locality in the EPR-Bohm Gedankenexperiment.
