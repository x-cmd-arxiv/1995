singularities. Suppose that S has degree 6. We show that the maximum number of
nodes which S can have is 65.
  An abbreviated history of this is as follows. Basset showed that S can have
at most 66 nodes. Catanese and Ceresa and Stagnaro constructed sextic surfaces
having 64 nodes. Barth has recently exhibited a 65 node sextic surface. We
complete the story by showing that S cannot have 66 nodes.
  Let f: S~ --> S be a minimal resolution of singularities. A set N of nodes on
S is even if there exists a divisor Q on S~ such that 2Q ~ f^{-1}(N). We show
that a nonempty even set of nodes on S must have size 24, 32, 40, 56, or 64.
This result is key to showing the nonexistence of the 66 node sextic.
  We do not know if a sextic surface can have an even node set of size 56 or
64. The existence or nonexistence of large even node sets is related to the
following vanishing problem. Let S be a normal surface of degree s in CP^3. Let
D be a Weil divisor on S such that D is Q-rationally equivalent to rH, for some
r \in \Q. Under what circumstances do we have H^1(O_S(D)) = 0? For instance,
this holds when r < 0. For s=4 and r=0, H^1 can be nonzero. For s=6 and r=0, if
a 56 or 64 node even set exists, then H^1 can be nonzero. The vanishing of H^1
is also related to linear normality, quadric normality, etc. of set-theoretic
complete intersections in P^3.

follow similar hierarchical relations to the observations, with $S_J$ almost

The system we are analyzing is the billiard system inside the region defined by
the quadratic (complex) conformal map $w = z + \lambda z^{2}$ of the unit disk
$|z| \le 1$ as introduced by Robnik (1983), with the shape parameter value
$\lambda = 0.15$, so that the billiard is still convex and has KAM-type
classical dynamics, where regular and irregular regions of classical motion
coexist in the classical phase space. By inspecting 100 and by showing 36
consecutive numerically calculated eigenfunctions we reach the following
conclusions: (1) Percival's (1973) conjectured classification in regular and
irregular states works well: the mixed type states ""living"" on regular {\em
and} irregular regions disappear in the semiclassical limit. (2) The irregular
(chaotic) states can be strongly localized due to the slow classical diffusion,
but become fully extended in the semiclassical limit when the break time
becomes sufficiently large with respect to the classical diffusion time. (3)
Almost all states can be clearly associated with some relevant classical object
like invariant torus, cantorus or periodic orbits. This paper is largely
qualitative but deep in the semiclassical limit and as such it is a prelude to
our next paper which is quantitative and numerically massive but at about ten
times lower energies.

numerically calculated and examined in the configuration space and in the phase
space which - in comparison with the classical phase space - enabled a clear
cut classification of energy levels into regular and irregular. This is the
first successful separation of energy levels based on purely dynamical rather
than special geometrical symmetry properties. We calculate the fractional
measure of regular levels as $\rho_1=0.365\pm 0.01$ which is in remarkable
agreement with the classical estimate $\rho_1=0.360\pm 0.001$. This finding
confirms the Percival's (1973) classification scheme, the assumption in
Berry-Robnik (1984) theory and the rigorous result by Lazutkin (1981,1991). The
regular levels obey the Poissonian statistics quite well whereas the irregular
sequence exhibits the fractional power law level repulsion and globally
Brody-like statistics with $\beta = 0.286\pm0.001$. This is due to the strong
localization of irregular eigenstates in the classically chaotic regions.
Therefore in the entire spectrum we see that the Berry-Robnik regime is not yet
fully established so that the level spacing distribution is correctly captured
by the Berry-Robnik-Brody distribution (Prosen and Robnik 1994).

amplitude is expressed as the sum of an infinite number of tree diagrams. We
investigate the possibility that an adequate approximation at energies up to
somewhat more than one $GeV$ can be made by keeping diagrams which involve the
exchange of resonances in this energy range in addition to the simplest chiral
contact terms. In this approach crossing symmetry is automatic but individual
terms tend to drastically violate partial wave unitarity. We first note that
the introduction of the $\rho$ meson in a chirally invariant manner
substantially delays the onset of drastic unitarity violation which would be
present for the {\it current algebra} term alone. This suggests a possibility
of local (in energy) cancellation which we then explore in a phenomenological
way. We include exchanges of leading resonances up to the $1.3 GeV$ region.
However, unitarity requires more structure which we model by a four derivative
contact term or by a low lying scalar resonance which is presumably subleading
in the $\1N$ expansion, but may nevertheless be important. The latter two
flavor model gives a reasonable description of the phase shift $\delta^0_0$ up
until around $860 MeV$, before the effects associated which the $K\bar{K}$

Examples are given to show that the straightforward extension of this statement

dimensions which rely on a Fefferman-Stein weighted norm inequality for a
relevant C\'ordoba type square function. The proof of this inequality is given
by an early version of an induction on scales argument. For $p<1$ we prove a

  Chem. Soc. - Faraday Trans",,,,"mtrl-th cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  We construct a class of periodic tilings of the plane, which corresponds to
toroidal arrangements of trivalent atoms, with pentagonal, hexagonal and
heptagonal rings. Each tiling is characterized by a set of four integers and
determines a toroidal molecule. The tiling rules are motivated by geometric
considerations and the tiling patterns are rich enough to describe a wide class
of toroidal carbon molecules, with a broad range of shapes and numbers of
atoms. The molecular dimensions are simply related to the integers that
determine the tiling. The configurational energy and the delocalisation energy
of several molecules obtained in this way were computed for Tersoff and
H\""uckel models. The results indicate that many of these molecules are not
strained, and may be expected to be stable. We studied the influence of size on
the H\""{u}ckel spectrum: it bears both similarities and differences as compared
with the case of tubules.

equations is proposed. The approach is based on the representation theory of
simple Lie algebras and their q - deformations and is presented here for
U_q(sl(n)). First a q - difference realization of U_q(sl(n)) in terms of
n(n-1)/2 commuting variables and depending on n-1 complex representation
parameters r_i, is constructed. From this realization lowest weight modules
(LWM) are obtained which are studied in detail for the case n=3 (the well known
n=2 case is also recovered). All reducible LWM are found and the polynomial
bases of their invariant irreducible subrepresentations are explicitly given.
This also gives a classification of the quasi-exactly solvable operators in the
present setting. The invariant subspaces are obtained as solutions of certain
invariant q - difference equations, i.e., these are kernels of invariant q -
difference operators, which are also explicitly given. Such operators were not
used until now in the theory of polynomial solutions. Finally the states in all
subrepresentations are depicted graphically via the so called Newton diagrams.
