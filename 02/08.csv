fact that part of the quantum state circulates on the closed timelike curves

discussion of a spacetime in with two disks in flat space are identified. If
the disks have an imaginary time separation, this corresponds to a heat bath.
An external field interacting with the heat bath will lose quantum coherence.
One can then analytically continue to an almost real separation of the disks.

Bethe ansatz solution given by Sklyanin has been generalized to the transfer
matrices of the fused models. We have shown that the eigenvalues of transfer
matrices satisfy a group of functional relations, which are the $su$(2) fusion
rule held by the transfer matrices of the fused models. The fused transfer
matrices form a commuting family and also commute with the quantum group
$U_q[sl(2)]$. In the case of the parameter $q^h=-1$ ($h=4,5,\cdots$) the
functional relations in the limit of spectral parameter $u\to \i\infty$ are
truncated. This shows that the $su$(2) fusion rule with finite level appears
for the six vertex model with the open boundary conditions. We have solved the
functional relations to obtain the finite-size corrections of the fused
transfer matrices for low-lying excitations. From the corrections the central
charges and conformal weights of underlying conformal field theory are
extracted. To see different boundary conditions we also have studied the

that apart from the Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter solution with constant
dilaton, such solutions do not exist if Lambda > 0 (in arbitrary spacetime
dimension >=4 ). However, asymptotically anti-de Sitter dyonic black hole
solutions with a non-trivial dilaton do exist if Lambda < 0. Both these
solutions and the asymptotically flat (Lambda = 0) solutions are studied
numerically for arbitrary values of the dilaton coupling parameter, g_0, in
four dimensions. The asymptotically flat solutions are found to exhibit two
horizons if g_0 = 0, 1, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{6}, ..., \sqrt{n(n+1)/2},..., and one
horizon otherwise. For asymptotically anti-de Sitter solutions the result is
similar, but the corresponding values of g_0 are altered in a non-linear
fashion which depends on Lambda and the mass and charges of the black holes.
All dyonic solutions with Lambda <= 0 are found to have zero Hawking
temperature in the extreme limit, however, regardless of the value of g_0.
