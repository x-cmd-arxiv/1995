  request from the author.)",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  A Beilinson completion algebra (BCA) A is a complete semilocal algebra over a
perfect field k, whose residue fields are high dimensional local fields. In
addition A is a semi-topological algebra. The completion of the structure sheaf
of an algebraic k-variety along a saturated chain of points is the prototypical
example of a BCA. We single out two kinds of homomorphisms between BCAs:
morphisms and intensifications. The first kind includes residually finite local
homomorphisms, whereas the second kind is a sort of localization. We prove that
every BCA A has a dual module K(A), and these dual modules are contravariant
w.r.t. morphisms and covariant w.r.t. intensifications. For any
semi-topological A-module M we define its dual Dual_{A} M := Hom_{A}^{cont}(M,
K(A)). This duality operation has the remarkable property of respecting
differential operators: given a continuous DO D : M --> N, there is a dual DO
Dual_{A}(D) : Dual_{A} N --> Dual_{A} M. The results above are used (in a
subsequent paper) to construct the Grothendieck residue complex K_{X}^{.} on
any finite type k-scheme X, and to derive many of its properties.

these clusters are apparently massive. In addition to their high X-ray
luminosity, two of the clusters at z~0.6 exhibit gravitationally lensed arcs.
Furthermore, the highest redshift cluster in our sample, MS1054-0321 at
z=0.826, is both extremely X-ray luminous (L[0.3-3.5 keV]=9.3x10^{44}
h_{50}^{-2} erg s^{-1}), and exceedingly rich with an optical richness
comparable to an Abell Richness Class 4 cluster.
  In this {\it Letter}, we discuss the cosmological implications of the very
existence of these clusters for hierarchical stucture formation theories such
as standard \Omega=1 CDM, hybrid \Omega=1 C+HDM, and flat, low-density
\Lambda+CDM models.

dispersion relations for elliptical galaxies has often been cited as an
argument against a picture in which ellipticals form by the merging of spiral
disks. A common view is that merging would mix together stars of disparate ages
and produce a large scatter in these relations. Here I use semi-analytic models
of galaxy formation to derive the distribution of the mean ages, colours and
metallicities of the stars in elliptical galaxies formed by mergers in a flat
CDM universe. It is seen that most of the stars in ellipticals form at
relatively high redshift (z > 1.9) and that the predicted scatter in the
colour-magnitude and Mg_2 - sigma relations falls within observational bounds.
I conclude that the apparent homogeneity in the properties of the stellar
populations of ellipticals is not inconsistent with a merger scenario for the
origin of these systems.

zero temperature fixed points that show non fermi liquid behavior. They include
the two channel Kondo effect, the two impurity Kondo model, and the fixed point
occurring in the four flavor Callan-Rubakov effect. We provide a unified
description which exploits the SO(8) symmetry of the bulk fermions. This leads
to a mapping between correlation functions of the different models.
Furthermore, we show that the two impurity Kondo fixed point and the
Callan-Rubakov fixed point are the same theory. All these models have the
puzzling property that the S matrix for scattering of fermions off the impurity
seems to be non unitary. We resolve this paradox showing that the fermions
scatter into collective excitations which fit into the spinor representation of
SO(8). Enlarging the Hilbert space to include those we find simple linear
boundary conditions. Using these boundary conditions it is straightforward to
recover all partition functions, boundary states and correlation functions of
these models.

model, to discuss the quarks' symmetry structure and momentum distribution in

mean-field calculation. The corresponding Hamiltonian contains not only an
effective interaction between the quarks and a scalar field, which is assumed
to parameterize all non-perturbative effects due to the non-linearity of QCD,
but also quark-quark interactions mediated through one-gluon-exchange. We also
evaluate the quark light-cone distribution functions, characterizing inclusive
deep-inelastic lepton scattering, for the nucleon as well as for the six-quark
structures. We find a competition between a softening of the quarks' momenta
through the increase of the confinement volume, and a hardening via the
admixture of higher symmetry configurations due to the color-electrostatic
one-gluon-exchange. These findings suggest an unexpected absence of
many-nucleon, multi-quark effects, even though six-quark structures should
represent a non-negligible part of the nuclear ground state.
