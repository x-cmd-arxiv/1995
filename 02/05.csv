thermodynamics, several attempts to beat this law are analyzed. The second law
wins, but an interesting interpretation of it emerges. This interpretation uses
the notion of ``encoded order'' and claims that whether a system is or is not
in thermodynamic equilibrium depends on the coordinates which the observer
decides to measure. This interpretation may not be new, but most present day
physicists seem to be unaware of it. The question of subjectivity of entropy
and the connection between the present interpretation and ``algorithmic
randomness'' are addressed.
  Key words: Maxwell's demon, perpetuum mobile, subjectivity, entropy,
H-theorem, randomness, complexity, information.

spectral properties of the Laplacian and the scattering matrix for planar
domains (called billiards). There is a close connection between eigenvalues of
the billiard Laplacian and the scattering phases, basically that every energy
at which a scattering phase is $2\pi$ corresponds to an eigenenergy of the
Laplacian. Interesting phenomena appear when the shape of the domain does not
allow an extension of the eigenfunction to the exterior. In this paper these
phenomena are studied and illustrated from several points of view.

states in $e^+\,e^-$ annihilation are extremely sensitive to the values of
$m_b$ and $\alpha_s$ for moments of large order $n$. This enables one to
extract from the existing data on $\Upsilon$ resonances the values of these
parameters with a high precision by using a non-relativistic expansion in
$1/n$. It is found that the sum rules fit the data with $\alpha_s^{\overline
{MS}} (1 \, GeV) = 0.336 \pm 0.011$ and $m_b=4827 \pm 7 MeV$, where the
estimate of the errors includes the theoretical uncertainty due to subleading
in $1/n$ terms and the experimental uncertainty of the $e^+\,e^-$ annihilation
cross section above the $B \overline B$ threshold. The found value of
$\alpha_s$, when evolved in two loops up to the $Z$ mass, gives
$\alpha_s^{\overline {MS}} (M_Z) = 0.109 \pm 0.001$. The $b$ quark mass $m_b$
corresponds to the `on shell' value appropriate for one-loop perturbative
calculations.

the isospin-mixing matrix elements in 1s0d-shell nuclei. We find that the
contribution of the quark mass difference effect is large and agrees with
experiment. This contribution may explain the Okamoto-Nolen-Schiffer anomaly,
alternatively to the meson-mixing contribution, which is recently predicted to
be reduced by the large off-shell correction.

simulated by a local hidden variables model. Most -if not all- the proofs of
this incompatibility refer to the correlations which arise when each of two (or
more) systems separated in space is subjected to a single ideal measurement.
This setting is good enough to show contradictions between local hidden
variables models and quantum mechanics in the case of pure states. However, as
shown here, it is not powerful enough in the case of mixtures. This is
illustrated by an example. In this example, the correlations which arise when
each of two systems separated in space is subjected to a single ideal
measurement are classical; only when each system is subjected to a {\it
sequence} of ideal measurements non-classical correlations are obtained. We
also ask whether there are situations for which even this last procedure is not
powerful enough and non-ideal measurements have to be considered as well.
