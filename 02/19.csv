  in the ESO QSO Absorption Line Workshop Proceedings}",,,"PSU-95-C1","astro-ph",,"  The classic question regarding Lyman-alpha forest clouds is whether they are
confined by the pressure of a hot, diffuse surrounding medium, or by the
gravity of dark matter mini-halos. This paper reviews these basic models for
forest clouds, considering spherical and slab geometries. At high redshift, the
clouds are still likely to be in the process of formation, and it seems
essential to consider them as dynamic structures in a cosmological context. At
low redshift, observations of large cloud sizes (indicated by their covering of
both lines of sight toward quasar pairs) have recently reshaped our view of the
forest. Galaxy-like disks/slabs, which would be gravity confined near the
center, but pressure confined in their outer regions (extending out to hundreds
of kpcs), may be responsible for the low z forest. The ultimate view of the
identity of the forest clouds and their relationship to galaxies is likely to
involve a synthesis of many of the models discussed here.

developed and explicit expressions for the smooth and the oscillatory parts of
the spectral density are derived. The parametric dependence of the spectrum on
the boundary condition is shown to be a very useful diagnostic tool in the
semiclassical analysis of the spectrum of billiards. It is also used to check
in detail some recently proposed parametric spectral statistics. The methods
are illustrated in the analysis of the spectrum of the Sinai billiard and its
parametric dependence on the boundary condition on the dispersing arc.

the Ernst equations of general relativity, it is shown how the known exact
solutions of general relativity can be used to give similiar solutions for
Yang-Mills theory. Thus all the known exact solutions of general relativity
with axial symmetry (e.g. the Kerr metric, the Tomimatsu-Sato metric) have
Yang-Mills equivalents. In this paper we only examine in detail the Kerr-like
solution. It will be seen that this solution has surfaces where the gauge and
scalar fields become infinite, which correspond to the infinite redshift
surfaces of the normal Kerr solution. It is speculated that this feature may be
connected with the confinement mechanism since any particle which carries an
SU(2) color charge would tend to become trapped once it passes these surfaces.
Unlike the Kerr solution, our solution apparently does not have any intrinsic
angular momentum, but rather appears to give the non-Abelian field
configuration associated with concentric shells of color charge.
