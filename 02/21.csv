``allowed"" range based on constraints from the IRAS galaxy survey and damped
Lyman--$\alpha $ systems. Our results show that no combination of parameters
can meet both limits. We consider constraints on the $\2-2$ scatterings which
keep the SIDM particles in pressure equilibrium, and we show that if such
interactions maintain pressure equilibrium down to the present, they will be
strong enough to disrupt galaxy mergers and may lead to stripping of galaxy
halos as galaxies move through the dark matter background of these particles.
Hence, we also investigate the evolution of large-scale structure in the SIDM
model when the particles drop out of pressure equilibrium at some higher
redshift. The resulting free-streaming leads to an additional suppression of
small-scale perturbations, but it does not significantly affect our results.

specific hierarchy for the projected matter $p$-point correlation functions. In
the small angle approximation and assuming a power-law spectrum I derive the
exact expressions of the coefficients $s_p$ relating the averaged $p$-order
angular correlation function, $\omb_p$ to the second one, $\omb_p=s_p\
\omb_2^{p-1}$. These results are valid for any selection function, but for a
top-hat angular filter only. These coefficients are found to be significantly
higher than their 3D counterparts, $S_p=\xib_p/\xib_2^{p-1}$.
  For the coefficient $s_3$ I discussed the accuracy of the small angle
approximation by computing, for particular examples, its angular dependence
with Monte-Carlo numerical integrations. It is found that the accuracy of the
small angle approximation for $\theta\approx 1^o$ slightly depends on the
selection function. Using the selection function expected for galaxy catalogues
the approximation is found to be reasonably good.
  The measurements of the $s_p$ parameters made in the APM angular survey are
found to give systematic lower values than the theoretical predictions. How
significant this discrepancy is and what the implications would be for galaxy
formation models is discussed in the last section.

produces a mapping between the classical phase spaces of the two theories in
which the bosonic (coordinate) fields transform nonlocally, the fermions
undergo a local tangent space chiral rotation, and all currents (fermionic and
bosonic) mix locally. Purely bosonic curvature-free currents of the chiral
model become a {\em symphysis} of purely bosonic and fermion bilinear currents
of the dual theory. The corresponding transformation functional $T$ which
relates wavefunctions in the two quantum theories is argued to be {\em exactly}
given by $T=\exp(iF)$.

algebraic curves to algebraic surfaces. We introduce certain Hecke-type
operators on vector bundles on an algebraic surface. The crucial observation is
that the algebra generated by the Hecke operators turns out to be a homomorphic
image of the {\it quantum toroidal algebra}. The latter is a quantization, in
the spirit of Drinfeld-Jimbo, of the universal enveloping algebra of the
universal central extension of a ""double-loop"" Lie algebra. This yields, in
particular, a new geometric construction of affine quantum groups of types A, D
E in terms of Hecke operators for an elliptic surface.

gives natural algebras $R_{21}u_1Ru_2=u_2R_{21}u_1R$ and $R_{21}x_1x_2=x_2x_1R$
for q-Minkowski and q-Euclidean spaces respectively. These algebras are
covariant under a corresponding background `rotation' quantum group. Semidirect
product by this according to the bosonisation procedure (also due to the
author) gives the corresponding Poincar\'e quantum groups. We review the
construction and collect the resulting R-matrix formulae for both Euclidean and
Minkowski cases in both enveloping algebra and function algebra form, and the
duality between them. Axioms for the Poincar\'e quantum group $*$-structure and
the dilaton problem are discussed.

eavesdropping attempt on the quantum channel creates errors in the
transmission. For a given error rate, the amount of information that may have
leaked to the eavesdropper depends on both the particular system and the
eavesdropping strategy. In this work, we discuss quantum cryptographic
protocols based on the transmission of weak coherent states and present a new
system, based on a symbiosis of two existing ones, and for which the
information available to the eavesdropper is significantly reduced. This system
is therefore safer than the two previous ones. We also suggest a possible
experimental implementation.
