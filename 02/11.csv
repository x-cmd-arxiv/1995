spatially correlated with but unbound to bright galaxies may account for the
low column QSO Ly$\alpha$ forests, providing an explanation for both the heavy
elements recently detected in them and the large sizes associated with them.
Thus, we suggest that structure formations in the early universe on scales
where matters collapse gravitationally and the gas forms stars are responsible
for the Ly$\alpha$ forests (cf. the mini-halo model). Supernovae shock the
interstellar gas to high temperature, and the resulting gas outflows from the
dwarfs owing to their shallow potential wells. The gas cools radiatively as the
radiative cooling time shortens because of adiabatic expansion. Subsequent
thermal instability results in condensation of clouds. The clouds inherit the
kinetic energy of the flow and coast to large distances, providing regions of
the absorbing gas with sizes of up to hundreds of kpc. We calculate the
Ly$\alpha$ absorption line profiles and the neutral column distribution, and
show that they are consistent with observations. We suggest that the Ly$\alpha$
forests are caused by the faint blue galaxies found in the deep extragalactic
surveys.

algebras over triple systems and the gauged WZW models invariant under them.
The N=2 superconformal algebras (SCA) realized over Freudenthal triple systems
(FTS) admit extension to ``maximal'' N=4 SCA's with SU(2)XSU(2)XU(1) symmetry.
A detailed study of the construction and classification of N=2 and N=4 SCA's
over Freudenthal triple systems is given. We conclude with a study and
classification of gauged WZW models with N=4 superconformal symmetry.

world-sheet supersymmetry have, in the presence of a rotational Killing
symmetry, only one complex structure which is an SO(2) singlet, while the other
two form an SO(2) doublet. Although N = 2 world-sheet supersymmetry is always
preserved under Abelian T-duality transformations, N = 4 breaks down to N = 2
in the rotational case. A non-local realization of N = 4 supersymmetry emerges,
instead, with world-sheet parafermions. For SO(3)-invariant metrics of purely
rotational type, like the Taub-NUT and the Atiyah-Hitchin metrics, none of the
locally realized extended world-sheet supersymmetries can be preserved under
non-Abelian duality.
