equations with annealing in temperature. The singular short-distance behaviour
of the Lennard-Jones potential is adiabatically switched on in order to obtain
stable convergence. As testbeds for the approach two distinct ensembles of
molecules are used, characterized by a roughly dense-packed ore a more
elongated ground state. For the latter, problems are generated from natural
frequencies of occurrence of amino acids and phenomenologically determined
potential parameters; they seem to represent less disorder than was previously
assumed in synthetic protein studies. For the dense-packed problems in
particular, the variational algorithm clearly outperforms a gradient descent
method in terms of minimal energies. Although it cannot compete with a careful
simulating annealing algorithm, the variational approach requires only a tiny
fraction of the computer time. Issues and results when applying the method to
polyelectrolytes at a finite temperature are also briefly discussed.

screening in ``monolayer'' crystals, which are strongly constrained to lie in a
flat two-dimensional plane. A strong nonlinear screening effect arises,
however, in 2d membranes allowed to buckle into the third dimension. This
screening drastically lowers dislocation and disclination energies, and forces
crystalline membranes to melt at any finite temperature. We point out that
buckled 5- and 7-fold disclinations in hexatic membranes have in general
different logarithmically divergent energies. A similar asymmetry exists in the
energies of 5- and 7-fold defects in {\it liquid} membranes. This difference
determines the sign of the Gaussian bending rigidity, and has important
consequences in membranes which can change their topology or with free boundary
conditions.

${\cal M}/{\cal G}$ is reviewed. The inner product on the cotangent space of
infinitesimal deformations of $\cal M$ defines an invariant distance and volume
form, or functional integration measure on the full configuration space. Then,
by a simple change of coordinates parameterizing the gauge fiber $\cal G$, the
functional measure on the coset space ${\cal M}/{\cal G}$ is deduced. This
change of integration variables leads to a Jacobian which is entirely
equivalent to the Faddeev-Popov determinant of the more traditional gauge fixed
approach in non-abelian gauge theory. If the general construction is applied to
the case where $\cal G$ is the group of coordinate reparametrizations of
spacetime, the continuum functional integral over geometries, {\it i.e.}
metrics modulo coordinate reparameterizations may be defined. The invariant
functional integration measure is used to derive the trace anomaly and
effective action for the conformal part of the metric in two and four
dimensional spacetime. In two dimensions this approach generates the
Polyakov-Liouville action of closed bosonic non-critical string theory. In four
dimensions the corresponding effective action leads to novel conclusions on the
importance of quantum effects in gravity in the far infrared, and in
particular, a dramatic modification of the classical Einstein theory at
cosmological distance scales, signaled first by the quantum instability of
classical de Sitter spacetime. Finite volume scaling relations for the
functional integral of quantum gravity in two and four dimensions are derived,
and comparison with the discretized dynamical triangulation approach to the
integration over geometries are discussed.

theory with the second derivative terms only. The general theory can be divided
into two classes, models of one are equivalent to conformally coupled with
gravity scalar field and also to general relativity with cosmological term. The
models of second class have one extra degree of freedom which corresponds to
dilaton. We calculate the one loop divergences for the models of second class
and find that the arbitrary functions of dilaton in the starting action can be
fine-tuned in such a manner that all the higher derivative counterterms
disappear on shell. The only structures in both classical action and
counterterms, which survive on shell, are the potential (cosmological) ones.
They can be removed by renormalization of the dilaton field which acquire the
nontrivial anomalous dimension, that leads to the effective running of the
cosmological constant. For some of the renormalizable solutions of the theory
the observable low energy value of the cosmological constant is small as
compared with the Newtonian constant. We also discuss another application of
our result.
