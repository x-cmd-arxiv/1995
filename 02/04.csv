Correlation Integrals, to study the clustering properties of Dark Matter Halos
(DH) in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Cold+Hot Dark Matter (CHDM) models. We
compare the results with those found in the CfA and SSRS galaxy catalogs. We
show that if we apply the analysis in redshift space, both models reproduce
equally well the observed clustering of galaxies. Mass segregation is also
found in the models: more massive DHs are more clustered compared with less
massive ones. In redshift space, this mass segregation is reduced by a factor
2-3 due to the peculiar velocities. Observational catalogs give an indication
of luminosity and size segregation, which is consistent with the predictions of
the models. Because the mass segregation is smaller in redshift space, it is
suggestive that the real luminosity or size segregation of galaxies could be
significantly larger than what it is found in redshift catalogs.

combined with the spectroscopic results of Friel & Janes, imply that the
foreground reddening to NGC 6791 lies in the range $0.24 > \ebv >0.19$ with
$+0.27 <$ [Fe/H] $<+0.44$.
  The zero-age horizontal branch models suggest that the red horizontal branch
stars of NGC 6791 have masses $\lesssim 0.7\msun$. The masses are similar to
those found for M67 red clump stars by Tripicco, Dorman & Bell (1993) and for
globular cluster red horizontal branch stars, despite higher and lower masses

tends to reduce stellar envelopes on the zero-age horizontal branch {\it to} a

low-energy edge excitations of incompressible quantum Hall fluids. These
excitations are described by (1+1)-dimensional effective field theories, which
are built by representations of the W-infinity algebra. Generic W-infinity
theories predict many more fluids than the few, stable ones found in
experiments. Here we identify a particular class of W-infinity theories, the
minimal models, which are made of degenerate representations only - a familiar
construction in conformal field theory. The W-infinity minimal models exist for
specific values of the fractional conductivity, which nicely fit the
experimental data and match the results of the Jain hierarchy of quantum Hall
fluids. We thus obtain a new hierarchical construction, which is based uniquely
on the concept of quantum incompressible fluid and is independent of Jain's
approach and hypotheses. Furthermore, a surprising non-Abelian structure is
found in the W-infinity minimal models: they possess neutral quark-like
excitations with SU(m) quantum numbers and non-Abelian fractional statistics.
The physical electron is made of anyon and quark excitations. We discuss some
properties of these neutral excitations which could be seen in experiments and
numerical simulations.
