continuum variability timescales was suggested to be the signature of
microlensing on cosmological scales (Hawkins 1993). A general theoretical
method for calculating such correlations is presented and applied to various
lensing scenarios in the framework of $\Lambda = 0$ Friedmann cosmologies. It
is shown that the observed timescales can be strongly influenced by the
observational limitations: the finite duration of the monitoring campaign and
the finite photometric sensitivity. In most scenarios the timescales increase
with source redshift, $z_s$, although slower than the $1+z_s$ time dilation
expected of intrinsic variability. A decrease can be obtained for an extended
source observed with moderate sensitivity. In this case, only lenses no further
away than several hundreds Mpc participate in the lensing. The resulting
optical depth is too small to explain the common long-term QSO variability
unless an extremely high local lens density is assumed. These results do not
support the idea that the reported inverse correlation can be attributed to
microlensing of a uniform QSO sample by a uniform distribution of lenses. The
possibility of using observations at various wavelengths and QSO samples at
various positions to identify microlensing in QSO variability is also
discussed.

spin-fluctuation spectra are calculated exactly up to the order $O(1/N^2)$. The
presented conserving approximation goes well beyond the $1/N$-approximation
({\em NCA}) and maintains local Fermi-liquid properties down to very low
temperatures. The position of the low lying Abrikosov-Suhl resonance (ASR) in
the impurity DOS is in accordance with Friedel's sum rule. For $N=2$ its shift
toward the chemical potential, compared to the {\em NCA}, can be traced back to
the influence of the vertex corrections. The width and height of the ASR is
governed by the universal low temperature energy scale $T_K$. Temperature and
degeneracy $N$-dependence of the static magnetic susceptibility is found in
excellent agreement with the Bethe-Ansatz results. Threshold exponents of the
local propagators are discussed. Resonant level regime ($N=1$) and intermediate

simple functionals of the density. There are three such functionals depending

view. Both these views are contrasted and the role of U(1) axial anomaly and

energy $\gamma p$ collisions via the charm quark excitation in a photon is
presented. Based on perturbative QCD and the nonrelativistic quark model, our
calculation demonstrates that the charm content of a photon may be very
important for the $J/\psi$ photoproduction at the large transverse momentum. It
is shown that at HERA energies $J/\psi$ production via the subprocess $cg\to
J/\si c$ dominates over the resolved photon contribution via the subprocess
$gg\to J/\psi g$ at $p_{\bot}>3$ GeV/c and over the direct photon-gluon fusion
contribution at $p_{bot}>10$ GeV/c.
