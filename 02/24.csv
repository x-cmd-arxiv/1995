describe (1) the sets of maps in these families having some prescribed rotation

between zero length and non-zero length rotation interval; and (3) the

discuss the interpretation of these maps as low-order spline approximations to
the classic ``sine-circle'' map and examine more generally the implications of
our results for the case of smooth circle maps. We also mention a possible

Kanamori with the main purpose of mimicking the ferromagnetism of transition
metals. Soon after, Nagaoka and Thouless pointed out a basic mechanism for
ferromagnetism in strongly correlated electron systems by studying the motion
of a single hole in a half--filled Hubbard model. This important work was hoped
to shed light onto metallic ferromagnetism from the low doping regime.
Unfortunately, this low doping route towards ferromagnetism has not been
successful as far as rigorous results for finite doping concentrations are
concerned. In the work presented here, we start from the opposite limit of low
particle concentrations. In this limit we provide the first proof of a fully
polarized metallic ground state for a Hubbard model. The proof proceeds by
mapping Hubbard ``zigzag'' chains onto a continuum model with an additional
degree of freedom and local first Hund's rule coupling. For this model the
maximum total spin multiplet is shown to be the unique ground state for
infinite Hubbard coupling. Our proof may open a low density route towards the
understanding of the ferromagnetism of Hubbard models.

the upper bound on the lightest-Higgs mass, and the triviality problem
associated with the Higgs sector. A new scheme based on the Higgs-Higgs
condensation is proposed, and it is shown that these three issues are well
solved by this scheme. As the first realization of this new scheme, the Minimal
Supersymmetric Model of Higgs-Higgs Condensation (MSMHHC) is constructed and
studied in detail. The MSMHHC is identical with the MSSM (Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model) in the fundamental particle content, and their
lagrangians differ only in the Higgs sector. The Higgs sector of the MSMHHC is
based on the softly-broken supersymmetric Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio model with the
four-field interaction of the Higgs doublets. At low energy, these two Higgs
doublets condense into two neutral Higgs gauge singlets, and the low-energy
effective lagrangian of the MSMHHC has the form of the non-minimal
supersymmetric standard model which contains two more Higgs singlets than the
MSSM. Another unique feature of the MSMHHC is that heavy top quark always
implies strongly-interacting low-energy Higgs sector, i.e., a large mass for
the lightest Higgs boson. A systematic study of the parameter space is also
made in order to reveal the qualitative features of the MSMHHC. Finally, we
comment on the question ""How large can the lightest-Higgs mass be?"" with the
conclusion that the supersymmetric model of Higgs-Higgs condensation will be
the most promising candidate if the lightest-Higgs mass of the MSSM is excluded

ref.\,\ct{emkw91,kw92,kw93}, is extended to general gauge theories by
reformulating it along the ideas of the antibracket-antifield formalism. From
the interplay of both frameworks a fully regularized version of the
field-antifield (FA) formalism arises, being able to deal with higher order
loop corrections and to describe higher order loop contributions to the BRST
anomaly. The quantum master equation, considered in the FA framework as the
quantity parametrizing BRST anomalies, is argued to be incomplete at two and
higher order loops and conjectured to reproduce only the one-loop corrections
to the $\hbar^p$ anomaly generated by the addition of $O(\hbar^{k})$, $k<p$,
counterterms. Chiral $W_3$ gravity is used to exemplify the nonlocally
regularized FA formalism. First, the regularized one-loop quantum master
equation is used to compute the complete one-loop anomaly. Its two-loop order,
however, is shown to reproduce only the modification to the two-loop anomaly
produced by the addition of a suitable one-loop counterterm, thereby providing
an explicit verification of the previous statement for $p=2$. The well-known
universal two-loop anomaly, instead, is alternatively obtained from the BRST
variation of the nonlocally regulated effective action. Incompleteness of the
quantum master equation is thus concluded to be a consequence of a naive
derivation of the FA BRST Ward identity.

symmetries act linearly on bosonic (toroidal and $E_8\times E_8$ gauge) string
coordinates as well as on the untwisted (toroidal and continuous Wilson lines)
moduli; they correspond to the scaling of toroidal moduli, the axionic shift of
toroidal moduli and the shift of the continuous Wilson line moduli. In turn
such symmetries provide sufficient constraints to determine the form of the
low-energy effective action associated with the untwisted moduli up to a
multiplicative factor.

repulsive at these momentum transfers, reduce the cross section by an
additional 15-30\%. Hence, relativistic nuclear-structure effects can account
for the more than a factor-of-two reduction in the cross section recently
reported by the LSND collaboration.

calculations (small space). The cumulative energy weighted sums are calculated
and compared for the $J=0^+$ $T$=0 to $J=1^+$ $T$=1 excitations in $^8{Be}$ and
for $J=0^+$ $T$=1 to both $J=1^+$ $T$=1 and $J$=$1^+$ $T$=2 excitations in

{\underline {spin}} transitions in $^{10}{Be}$ that the summed strength in the
{\underline {large}} space is less than in the {\underline {small}} space. We
find that the high energy energy-weighted isovector orbital strength is smaller
than the low energy strength for transitions in which the isospin is changed,
but for $J=0^+$ $T$=1 to $J=1^+$ $T$=1 in $^{10}{Be}$ the high energy strength
is larger. We find that the low lying orbital strength in $^{10}{Be}$ is
anomalously small, when an attempt is made to correlate it with the $B(E2)$
strength to the lowest $2^+$ states. On the other hand a sum rule of Zheng and
Zamick which concerns the total $B(E2)$ strength is reasonably satisfied in
both $^8{Be}$ and $^{10}{Be}$. The Wigner supermultiplet scheme is a useful
guide in analyzing shell model results. In $^{10}Be$ and with a $Q \cdot Q$
interaction the T=1 and T=2 scissors modes are degenerate, with the latter
carrying 5/3 of the T=1 strength.

influence of dissipative and dispersive perturbations is investigated. In
particular a coupling to a long-wave mode is considered using extended
Ginzburg-Landau equations. The study is motivated by the experimental
observation of localized wave trains (`pulses') in binary-liquid convection.
These pulses have been found to drift exceedingly slowly. The perturbation
analysis reveals two distinct mechanisms which can lead to a `trapping' of the
pulses by the long-wave concentration mode. The are given by the effect of the
concentration mode on the local growth rate and on the frequency of the wave.
The latter, dispersive mechanism has not been recognized previously, despite
the fact that it dominates over the dissipative contribution within the
perturbation theory. A second unexpected result is that the pulse can be
accelerated by the concentration mode despite the reduced growth rate ahead of
the pulse. The dependence of the pulse velocity on the Rayleigh number is
discussed, and the hysteretic `trapping' transitions suggested by the
perturbation theory are confirmed by numerical simulations, which also reveal
oscillatory behavior of the pulse velocity in the vicinity of the transition.
The derivation and reconstitution of the extended Ginzburg-Landau equations is
discussed in detail.
