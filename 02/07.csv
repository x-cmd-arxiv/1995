account of the production of the light nuclides during the early evolution of
the Universe. Consistency among the predicted and observed abundances of D,
$^3$He, \hel4 and \li7 leads to restrictive lower and upper bounds to the
present density of nucleons. In particular, the upper bound ensures that
nucleons cannot account for more than a small fraction $(<0.06 h{^{-2} _{50}})$
of the mass in a critical density (Einstein-de Sitter) Universe. In contrast,
x-ray observations of rich clusters of galaxies suggest strongly that baryons
(in hot gas) contribute a significant fraction of the total cluster mass $(\ge
0.2 h{^{-3/2} _{50}})$. If, indeed, clusters do provide a ``fair"" sample of the
mass in the Universe, this ``crisis"" forces us to consider other ways of
mitigating it, including the politically incorrect possibility that $\Omega <
1$. The options, including magnetic or turbulent pressure, clumping, and
non-zero space curvature and/or cosmological constant, are discussed.

Virgo spiral M100 (NGC 4321) display remarkable morphological changes with
wavelength. While in the optical the light is dominated by a circumnuclear zone
of enhanced star formation, the features in the 2.2\mum image correspond to a
newly discovered kpc-size stellar bar, and a pair of leading arms situated
inside an ovally-shaped region. Only 5% of the K flux is emitted in
antisymmetric structures. This indicates that the morphology seen in the NIR is
dominated by a global density wave. Making a first-order correction for the
presence of localized dust extinction in K using the I-K image, we find that
the observed leading arm morphology is slightly hidden by dust. Possible
mechanisms responsible for the optical and NIR morphology are discussed, and
tests are proposed to discriminate between them. Conclusions are supported with
an evolutionary stellar population model reproducing the optical and NIR colors
in a number of star forming zones. We argue that this morphology is compatible
with the presence of a pair of inner Lindblad resonances in the region, and
show this explicitly in an accompanying paper by detailed numerical modeling.
The observed phenomena may provide insight into physical processes leading to
central activity in galaxies.

contaminating foreground stars allows us to push the star counts to
significantly lower surface densities than has previously been possible. We
find that most of our sample clusters show extra-tidal wings in their surface
density profiles. The form of the surface density profiles is consistent with
recent numerical studies of the tidal stripping of globular clusters.
Two-dimensional surface density maps for several clusters are consistent with
the expected appearance of tidal tails, with allowance for the effects of orbit
shape, orbital phase, and orientation of our line of sight. We identify the
extra-tidal material with stars which are still in the process of being removed
from the clusters. The extra-tidal stars effectively limit the accuracy to
which we can resolve the ``tidal'' radii of globular clusters. However, by
tracing the orbital paths of their parent clusters, these stars may also
facilitate a renewed attack on the problem of determining globular cluster
orbits and the shape of the Galactic potential field.

fields, such as extra-solar planet direct detection, extra-galactic science and
circumstellar imaging. Using a high quality coronograph, dynamic ranges of up
to $10^{5}$ have been achieved. However the ultimate limitations of
coronographs do not come from their optical performances, but from scattering
due to imperfections in the optical surfaces of the collecting system. We
propose to use a deformable mirror to correct these imperfections and decrease
the scattering level in local regions called ``dark holes''. Using this
technique will enable imaging of fields with dynamic ranges exceeding $10^8$.
We show that the dark-hole algorithm results in a lower scattering level than
simply minimizing the RMS figure error (maximum-strehl-ratio algorithm). The
achievable scattering level inside the dark-hole region will depend on the
number of mirror actuators, the surface quality of the telescope, the
single-actuator influence function and the observing wavelength. We have
simulated cases with a $37\times37$ deformable mirror using data from the {\it
Hubble Space Telescope\/} optics without spherical aberrations and have
demonstrated dark holes with rectangular and annular shapes. We also present a
preliminary concept of a monolithic, fully integrated, high density deformable

buckled, this interaction is linear in $O$ displacement along the c-axis, and
the coupling constant is found to be large. The formation of a spin singlet
causes additional contributions to the phonon self-energy, and we calculate
from these the superconductive phonon anomalies. The magnitude and sign of the
frequency shift and linewidth broadening for various mode symmetries correspond
well with Raman and infra-red light scattering experiments, and with neutron
scattering studies. In the t-J model, spin singlet formation and
superconductivity do not coincide in the low-doping regime, giving rise to
spin-gap features and a variety of temperature scales in the spin response
observed by NMR and neutron investigations. Phonon anomalies in underdoped
YBaCuO compounds indeed show evidence of spin-gap phenomena with the same
characteristic temperature, suggesting that the theory may offer the
possibility of a unified understanding of the anomalies in magnetic and lattice
properties. While the origin of the superconducting interaction is electronic,
this spin-phonon coupling affords the possibility of a small isotope effect,

boundary condition for moving boundaries, and solve for the density and the
temperature fields of the steady state in the quasi-incompressible limit, where
the average separation between the particles is much smaller than the average
diameter of the particles. The fields obtained from Haff's equations show the
same scaling as those from the simulations. The origin of the scaling can be
easily understood. The behavior of the fields from the theory is consistent
with the simulation data for small $x$, but they deviate significantly for
large $x$. We argue that the deviation is due to the breakdown of the

$a^3 = a_1 a_2 a_3$, which depends on time and on the barotropic index of the
equation of state used, can be written as a function of a ``cosmic time''
reduced in terms of another function of the mean scale factor depending itself
again on the barotropic index but independent of the metrics here employed.
This reduction procedure permites one to analyze if explicitly given
anisotropic cosmological solutions ``isotropize'' in the course of their time

Universe in General Relativity based cosmology. In TGD based cosmology the
paradox has explanation. Photons can be either topologically condensed on
background spacetime surface or in 'vapour phase' that is progate in
$M^4_+\times CP_2$ as small surfaces. The time for propagation from A to B is
in general larger in condensate than in vapour phase. In principle observer
detects from a given astrophysical object both vapour phase and condensate
photons, vapour phase photons being emitted later than condensate photons.
Therefore the erraneous identification of vapour phase photons as condensate
photons leads to an over estimate for the age of the star and star can look
older than the Universe. The Hubble constant for vapour phase photons is that
associated with $M^4_+$ and smaller than the Hubble constant of matter
dominated cosmology. This could explain the measured two widely different
values of Hubble constant if smaller Hubble constant corresponds to the Hubble
constant of the future light cone $M^4_+$. The ratio of propagation velocities
of vapour phase and condensate photons equals to ratio of the two Hubble
constants, which in turn is depends on the ratio of mass density and critical
mass density, only. Anomalously large redshifts are possible since vapour phase

the following condition (C):
  (C): if an open set U in the real line is unbounded above then there exists a
sequence belonging to F, which has an infinite number of terms belonging to U.
  For the functions f,g from {0,1,2,...} to {0,1,2,...} we define: f =< g if
and only if {i: f(i) > g(i)} is finite.
  Let b denote the smallest cardinality of a unbounded (in the sense of =<)
family of functions from {0,1,2,...} to {0,1,2,...}, see [1].
  Theorem 1. If F is a family of sequences converging to +infinity and card F <
b, then F does not satisfy condition (C).
  Corollary. Every family of sequences converging to +infinity which satisfies
the condition (C) is uncountable, Martin's axiom implies that each such family
has cardinality continuum (because Martin's axiom implies that b=continuum, see
[1], [2]).
  Theorem 2. There exists a family of sequences converging to +infinity which
satisfies condition (C) and has cardinality b.

the S-wave T-matrix in a three coupled channel, multiresonance unitary model.
Results are compared with values already reported in literature which are
obtained applying multichannel, but single resonance -- no background models. A
dispersion among the previously published values of the real part of the S-wave
scattering length is observed. We demonstrate that the reported spread
originates from the strong sensitivity of the scattering length upon the small
variation of the used input resonance parameters. In addition, we show that
eta-N scattering length value obtained in single resonance -- no background
models significantly increases if background term is added in a unitary way. We
question the reliability of previously reported values based only on the single
resonance -- no background models, and demonstrate that the value of the eta-N
S-wave scattering length obtained in this publication is much more realistic
because of the multiresonance and unitary approach.

to dissipative dynamics in order to study the problem of memory capacity. It is
shown that infinitely many vacua are accessible to memory printing in a way
that in sequential information recording the storage of a new information does
not destroy the previously stored ones, thus allowing a huge memory capacity.
The mechanism of information printing is shown to induce breakdown of
time-reversal symmetry. Thermal properties of the memory states as well as
their relation with squeezed coherent states are finally discussed.
