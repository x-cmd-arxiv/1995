partial to a line arrangement dual to generic. In III we constructed a

some extra properties of the factorization , namely invariant properties, also
proven in IV. The group is presented using a certain quotient of the Braid

bang nucleosynthesis, depend sensitively on the baryon density. Thus, the
observed abundances of D and \he may provide useful ``baryometers'' provided
the evolution from primordial to present (or, presolar nebula) abundances is
understood. Inevitably, the derivation of primordial from observed abundances
requires the intervention of a model for galactic evolution and, so, the
inferred primordial abundances are, necessarily, model dependent. Here, an
analytic framework for the evolution of D and \he is presented which is
``generic'' in the sense that it should describe the results of any specific
galactic evolution model. The ``effective \he survival fraction'', $\Gamma _3$,
is the one free parameter which is model specific. Solar system and
interstellar data are used to infer upper and lower bounds to the primordial
deuterium mass fraction $(X_{2P})$ as a function of $\Gamma _3$ and, these

mesoscopic lattice deformation that ``anticipates'' the upcoming phase
transition. Among these precursive effects is the observation of the so-called
``tweed'' pattern in transmission electron microscopy in a wide variety of
materials. We have investigated the tweed deformation in a two dimensional
model system, and found that it arises because the compositional disorder
intrinsic to any alloy conspires with the natural geometric constraints of the
lattice to produce a frustrated, glassy phase. The predicted phase diagram and
glassy behavior have been verified by numerical simulations, and diffraction
patterns of simulated systems are found to compare well with experimental data.
Analytically comparing to alternative models of strain-disorder coupling, we

the torsionless $(4,4)$ hyper-K\""ahler sigma models in the standard harmonic

depend on $n$ copies of a triple of analytic harmonic $(4,4)$ superfields. As
distinct from the hyper-K\""ahler case, the potentials prove to be severely

multiplet, while for $n\geq 2$ there exists a wide class of new actions which
cannot be written only via twisted multiplets. Their most striking feature is
the nonabelian and in general nonlinear gauge invariance which substitutes the
abelian gauge symmetry of the dual action of twisted multiplets and ensures the
correct number of physical degrees of freedom. We show, on a simple example,
that these actions describe sigma models with non-commuting left and right

we propose a set of order parameters that will do the job. We articulate the
fact that any useful Aharonov-Bohm experiment necessarily proceeds in two
stages: calibration and measurement. World sheets of virtual cosmic string
loops can wrap around test charges, thus changing their states relative to
other charges in the universe. Consequently, repeated flux measurements with
test charges will not necessarily agree. This was the main stumbling block to
previous attempts to construct order parameters for non-Abelian gauge theories.
In those works, the particles that one uses for calibration and subsequent
measurement are stored in {\em separate} ``boxes''. By storing all test
particles in the {\em same} ``box'', we show how quantum fluctuations can be
overcome. The importance of gauge fixing is also emphasized.

a recent (p,n) quasifree experiment at 494 MeV are analyzed in a Glauber theory
framework up to two-step contributions. Nuclear correlations are treated in the
continuum random phase approximation, accounting for the spreading width of the
particle-hole states. A good description of the spin-longitudinal response is
achieved, hinting at some evidence of pionic effects in the quasielastic
region. The spin-transverse response is underestimated and we show that
multistep contributions, while sizable, are not sufficient to provide an
explanation of the discrepancy.

dense neutron star matter allowing for the explicit presence of hyperons. Using
various models we find that the condensate threshold is sensitive to the
behavior of the scalar density; the more rapidly it increases with baryon
density, the lower is the threshold for condensation. The presence of hyperons,
particularly the $\Sigma^-$, shifts the threshold for $K^-$ condensation to a
higher density. In the mean field approach, with hyperons, the condensate
amplitude grows sufficiently rapidly that the nucleon effective mass vanishes
at a finite density and a satisfactory treatment of the thermodynamics cannot
be achieved. Thus, calculations of kaon-baryon interactions beyond the mean
field level appear to be necessary.

three-dimensional (equal-time) formulations of quantum kinetic theory. We show
that the three-dimensional approach can be obtained as the energy average of
the covariant formulation. We illustrate this statement in scalar and spinor
QED. For scalar QED we derive Lorentz covariant transport and constraint
equations directly from the Klein-Gordon equation rather than through the
previously used Feshbach-Villars representation. We then consider pair
production in a spatially homogeneous but time-dependent electric field and
show that the pair density is derived much more easily via the energy averaging
method than in the equal-time representation. Proceeding to spinor QED, we
derive the covariant version of the equal-time equation derived by
Bialynicki-Birula et al. We show that it must be supplemented by another
self-adjoint equation to obtain a complete description of the covariant spinor
Wigner operator. After spinor decomposition and energy average we study the
classical limit of the resulting three-dimensional kinetic equations. There are
only two independent spinor components in this limit, the mass density and the
spin density, and we derive also their covariant equations of motion. We then
show that the equal-time kinetic equation provides a complete description only
for constant external electromagnetic fields, but is in general incomplete. It
must be supplemented by additional constraints which we derive explicitly from
the covariant formulation.

properties is reviewed. Within this classification, front propagation is
discussed in a non-gradient relaxational potential flow. The model is motivated
by transient pattern phenomena in nematics. A front propagating into an
unstable homogenous state leaves behind an unstable periodic pattern, which
decays via a second front and a second periodic state. An interface between
unstable periodic states is shown to be a source of propagating fronts in
opposite directions.

function for the Hamiltonian densities to be derived in closed form.
