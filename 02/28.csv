different normalizations of the HDM power spectrum in an Omega_0=1 universe
using the statistics of peaks of a random Gaussian field. Concerning cluster
formation only, the neutrino picture appears to be marginally consistent with
observations for H_0=70 km/s/Mpc provided the normalization is
alpha=sigma_0/delta_s=0.42 with sigma_0 the rms variance of the fluctuations
linearly evolved to the present epoch and delta_s the collapse threshold
required in structure formation models. However, using the constraint that the
formation epoch of QSO's puts on the HDM model, it appears that this
normalization is too small to be consistent with quasars formation. Allowing
higher values for the Hubble constant alleviates this problem but leads to an
unacceptable short age of the universe. Moreover, the constraint put by the
recent measurement of the level of fluctuations in the cosmic background
radiation by COBE tends to reject models with high values of H_0. We conclude
that the neutrino model fails in any case to account for the whole set of
available observations in a consistent way.

earlier study about line profiles. The three velocity dispersions in the main

gauge field confining spinon and holon is shown to be gapped at {\em finite

2D. The gap in the gauge fluctuation disappears at half-filling limit, where a
long-range antiferromagnetic order is recovered at zero temperature and spinons
become confined. The most interesting features of spin dynamics and transport
are exhibited at finite doping where exotic {\em residual} couplings between
spin and charge degrees of freedom lead to systematic anomalies with regard to
a Fermi-liquid system. In spin dynamics, a commensurate antiferromagnetic
fluctuation with a small, doping-dependent energy scale is found, which is
characterized in momentum space by a Gaussian peak at ($\pi/a$, $ \pi/a$) with
a doping-dependent width ($\propto \sqrt{\delta}$, $\delta$ is the doping

non-Korringa behavior for the NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate. There also
exits a characteristic temperature scale below which a pseudogap behavior
appears in the spin dynamics. Furthermore, an incommensurate magnetic
fluctuation is also obtained at a {\em finite} energy regime. In transport, a

non-perturbative effects, we derive a new expansion in powers of $1/Q^2$ for
the structure function that is free of infra-red singularities and which
reduces corrections to the leading term. The leading term represents scattering
from an off-mass-shell parton, which keeps the same virtual mass in the final
state. It is found that this quasi-free term is a function of a new variable
$\bar x$, which coincides with the Bjorken variable $x$ for $Q^2\to\infty$. The
two variables are very different, however, at finite $Q^2$. In particular, the
variable $\bar x$ depends on the invariant mass of the spectator particles.
Analysis of the data at large $x$ shows excellent scaling in the variable $\bar
x$, and determines the value of the diquark mass to be close to zero. $\bar
x$-scaling allows us to extract the structure function near the elastic
threshold. It is found to behave as $F_2\sim (1-x)^{3.7}$. Predictions for the

experiments and large underground detectors are of limited help in initially
detecting the LSP although perhaps they could provide confirmation of a signal
seen in other experiments, while table top detectors have considerable
discovery potential. Colliders, however, might be the best dark matter

small window for a $\nu_\tau$ mass is exploited.) Our resulting upper limits

WZW model on a torus. The asymptotics of our solutions at critical level gives
eigenfunctions of Euler-Calogero-Moser integrable $N$-body systems. As a
by-product, we obtain some remarkable integral identities involving classical
theta functions.

either through NN bremsstrahlung or through photon-induced reactions. We
emphasize the dependence of the expected cross-sections on the electromagnetic
formfactor of the nucleon in the time-like regime and point out that the
mentioned reactions can provide important information on the validity of vector
meson dominance for the nucleon. We also study the off-shell dependence of the
formfactors.

electron scattering data based upon a mean field approach. The nuclear charge
distributions are generated by solving the Schroedinger equation with a
mean-field potential expanded in terms of Hermite functions. The coefficients
of the potential are changed in order to obtain the best fit with the cross
section data. Applications to the $^{12}C$, $^{16}O$ $^{40}Ca$ and $^{208}Pb$

the null-plane evolution is expressed in terms of a deformed Schr\""odinger

metastable states across a cubic barrier of arbitrary height. For high
barriers, a variational resummation procedure is applied to the complex energy
eigenvalues obtained from a WKB expansion; for low barriers, the variational
resummation procedure converts the non-Borel-summable
Rayleigh-Schr\""o\-din\-ger expansion into an exponentially fast convergent one.
The results in the two regimes match and yield very accurate imaginary parts of
the energy eigenvalues. This is demonstrated by comparison with the complex
eigenvalues from solutions of the Schr\""odinger equation via the
complex-coordinate rotation method.
