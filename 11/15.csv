the question of whether there are nontrivial algebra surjections $R\to T$ which
induce isomorphisms $\Omega_{R/k}\otimes T \to \Omega_{T/k}$. Such maps, called
evolutions, arise naturally in the study of Hecke algebras, as they implicitly
do in the recent work of Wiles, Taylor-Wiles, and Flach. We show that the
existence of non-trivial evolutions of an algebra $T$ can be characterized in
terms of the symbolic square of an ideal defining $T$. We give a
characterization of the symbolic square in terms of Fitting ideals. Using this
and other techniques we show that certain classes of reduced algebras --
codimension 2 Cohen-Macaulay, Codimension 3 Gorenstein, licci algebras in
general, and some others -- admit no nontrivial evolutions. On the other hand
we give examples showing that non-trivial evolutions of reduced Cohen-Macaulay
algebras of codimension 3 do exist in every positive characteristic.

($z=0.41$), and compare them to the Coma cluster at $z\approx 0$. The
photometric data for each cluster are well-described by the Kormendy relation
$r_e \propto \Sigma_e^{A}$, where $A=-0.9$ in the optical and $A=-1.0$ in the
near-IR. The scatter about this near-IR relation is only $0.076$ in $\log r_e$
at the highest redshift, which is much smaller than at low redshifts,
suggesting a remarkable homogeneity of the cluster elliptical population at
$z=0.41$. We use the intercept of these fixed-slope correlations at $R_e =
1$~kpc (assuming $H_0=75$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_0=0.2$, and
$\Lambda_0=0$, where the results are only weakly dependent on the cosmology) to
construct the Tolman SB test for these three clusters. The data are fully
consistent with universal expansion if we assume simple models of passive
evolution for elliptical galaxies, but are inconsistent with a non-expanding
geometry (the tired light cosmology) at the $5 \, \sigma$ confidence level at
$z=0.41$. These results suggest luminosity evolution in the restframe $K$-band
of $0.36 \pm 0.14$~mag from $z = 0.41$ to the present, and are consistent with
the ellipticals having formed at high redshift. The SB intercept in elliptical
galaxy correlations is thus a powerful tool for investigating models of their
evolution for significant lookback times.

instrument exposure is explicitly taken into account. By computing the
likelihood for the data, we construct a probability distribution in parameter
space that may be used to infer the probability that a repetition signal is
present, and to estimate the values of the repetition parameters. The
likelihood function contains contributions from all the bursts, irrespective of
the size of their positional errors --- the more uncertain a burst's position
is, the less constraining is its contribution. Thus this approach makes maximal
use of the data, and avoids the ambiguities of sample selection associated with

significant anti-correlation of column density with continuum flux gives direct
evidence that the warm absorber is photoionized by the X-ray continuum. From
the timescale of the variation of the OVIII column density, we estimate that it
originates from gas within a radius of about $10^{17}\cm$ of the central
engine. In contrast, the depth of the OVII edge shows no response to the
continuum flux, which indicates that it originates in gas at larger radii. Our
results strongly suggest that there are two warm absorbing regions; one located
near or within the Broad Line Region, the other associated with the outer

with $\Omega_0\le 0.4$ and flat models with $\Omega_0=0.2$. However, the
analysis of individual observational samples gives contradictory results; in
particular the recent Giovanelli data, which imply much lower velocities (with
significantly smaller uncertainties) than the other data, are actually only
consistent with the open $\Omega_0=0.4$ and the flat $\Omega_0=0.2$ models,

severely restricts the choice of the random force, but we prove that this

fluctuations is weakly coupled to the fluctuating variable, then the
statistical properties of the random force can be completely specified. For
variables odd under time-reversal, microscopic reversibility and weak coupling
impose symmetry relations on the variable-dependent Onsager coefficients. We
then analyze the fluctuations in two cases: Brownian motion in position space
and an asymmetric diode, for which the analysis based in the master equation
approach is known. We find that, to the order of validity of the Langevin

of quarks and with a substantial contribution of a gluonic component. The first

transport approach, in which the multiparticle final state is treated as an
evolving mixture of partons and hadrons, whose proportions are controlled by
their local space-time geography via standard perturbative QCD parton shower
evolution and a phenomenological model for non-perturbative parton-cluster
formation followed by cluster decays into hadrons. Our numerical simulations
exhibit a characteristic `inside-outside' evolution simultanously in position

and find large effects due to cluster formation by the combination of partons
from different W parents. In particular, we find in our preferred model a shift
of several hundred MeV in the apparent mass of the W, which is considerably
larger than in previous model calculations. This suggests that the
determination of the W mass at LEP2 may turn out to be a sensitive probe of

continuous sequence of effective Hamiltonians which describe the dynamics on
successively larger length scales. We show for the case of \phi^4 theory that
the masses and couplings in these effective Hamiltonians vary in accordance
with 1-loop renormalization group equations. This is evidence for an intimate
connection between Wilson's renormalization and the venerable Bloch-Feshbach
formalism.

problematic than is usually supposed. Onset of CT can be imitated by other
mechanisms, which contain no explicit QCD dynamics. In the case of the
$(e,e'p)$ reaction the standard inelastic shadowing well known in the pre-QCD
era, causes a substantial growth of nuclear transparency with $Q^2$ and a
deviation from the Glauber model, analogous to what is assumed to be a signal
of CT.
  In the case of exclusive virtual photoproduction of vector mesons, CT is
expected to manifest itself as an increase of nuclear transparency with $Q^2$
in production of the ground states and as an abnormal nuclear enhancement for
the radial excitations. We demonstrate that analogous $Q^2$-dependence can be
caused at moderate energies by the variation of so called coherence length,
which is an interference effect, even in the framework of the vector dominance
model.
  One should disentangle the real and the mock CT effects in experiments
planned at CEBAF, at the HERMES spectrometer, or at the future electron
facility ELFE.

a microscopic three-cluster model. The initial bound and the final scattering
states are described consistently within the same model. The parity-violating
decay width is calculated in perturbation theory using the parity-nonconserving
nucleon-nucleon interaction of Desplanques, Donoghue, and Holstein (DDH). We
find that the decay width is sensitive to dynamical degrees of freedom which
are beyond the alpha+p+n model, for example, alpha excitation and breakup. In
our full model, which contains breathing excitations of the alpha particle and
H-3 + He-3 rearrangement, the parity-nonconserving decay width is
Gamma=3.97x10^{-9} eV, using the DDH coupling constants.
