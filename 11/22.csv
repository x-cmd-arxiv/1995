now. The bottom line in this review is that despite the availability of the
cosmological constant as an extra parameter for flat Friedmann models, the
allowed parameter space for such models is very small. The observations that we
consider here include the ages of globular clusters, measurement of Hubble's
constant, abundance of rich clusters of galaxies, fraction of mass contributed
by baryons in rich clusters and abundance of high redshift objects.

of a self-gravitating collisionless stellar system, in which the particles are
also submitted to an external potential. The system is steady and spherically
symmetric, and its distribution function $f_0$ thus depends only on the energy
$E$ and the squarred angular momentum $L^2$ of a particle. Assuming that
$\partial f_0 / \partial E < 0$, it is first shown that stability holds with
respect to all the spherical perturbations -- a statement which turns out to be
also valid for a rotating spherical system. Thus it is proven that the energy
of an arbitrary aspherical perturbation associated to a ``preserving generator""
$\delta g_1$ [i.e., one satisfying $\partial f_0 / \partial L^2 \{ \delta g_1,
L^2 \} = 0$] is always positive if $\partial f_0 / \partial L^2 \leq 0$ and the
external mass density is a decreasing function of the distance $r$ to the
center. This implies in particular (under the latter condition) the stability
of an isotropic system with respect to all the perturbations. Some new remarks
on the relation between the symmetry of the system and the form of $f_0$ are
also reported. It is argued in particular that a system with a distribution
function of the form $f_0 = f_0 (E,L^2)$ is necessarily spherically symmetric.

of these matrices force them to have pairs of opposite real eigenvalues, so
that the average density of eigenvalues must vanish at the origin. These
densities are studied for finite $N\times N$ matrices in the Gaussian ensemble.
In the large $N$ limit the density of eigenvalues is given by a semi-circle
law. However, near the origin there is a region of size $1\over N$ in which
this density rises from zero to the semi-circle, going through an oscillatory
behavior. This cross-over is calculated explicitly by various techniques. We
then show to first order in the non-Gaussian character of the probability
distribution that this oscillatory behavior is universal, i.e. independent of
the probability distribution. We conjecture that this universality holds to all
orders. We then extend our consideration to the more complicated block matrices
which arise from lattices of matrices considered in our previous work. Finally,
we study the case of random real symmetric matrices made of blocks. By using a
remarkable identity we are able to determine the oscillatory behavior in this
case also. The universal oscillations studied here may be applicable to the
problem of a particle propagating on a lattice with random magnetic flux.

interpolating sequences for various $B_{\alpha}^{p}$. The limiting cases
$\alpha=-1/p$ and $p=\infty$ are respectively the Hardy spaces $H^p$ and
$A^{-\alpha}$, the holomorphic functions with polynomial growth of order
$\alpha$, which have generated particular interest.
  In \S 1 we first collect some definitions and well-known facts about weighted
Bergman spaces and then introduce the natural interpolation problem, along with
some basic properties. In \S 2 we describe in terms of $\alpha$ and $p$ the
inclusions between $B_{\alpha}^{p}$ spaces, and in \S 3 we show that most of
these inclusions also hold for the corresponding spaces of interpolating
sequences. \S 4 is devoted to sufficient conditions for a sequence to be
$B_{\alpha}^{p}$-interpolating, expressed in the same terms as the conditions
given in previous works of Thomas for the Hardy spaces and Massaneda for
$A^{-\alpha}$. In particular we show, under some restrictions on $\alpha$ and
$p$, that finite unions of $B_{\alpha}^{p}$-interpolating sequences coincide
with finite unions of separated sequences.
  In his article in Inventiones, Seip implicitly gives a characterization of
interpolating sequences for all weighted Bergman spaces in the disk. We spell
out the details for the reader's convenience in an appendix (\S 5).

The first is a dynamical process governed by the equations of local quantum
field theory. This process is local and deterministic, but it generates a
structure that is not compatible with observed reality. A second process is
therefore invoked. This second process somehow analyzes the structure generated
by the first process into a collection of possible observable realities, and
selects one of these as the actually appearing reality. This selection process
is not well understood. It is necessarily nonlocal and, according to orthodox
thinking, is governed by an irreducible element of chance. The occurrence of
this irreducible element of chance means that the theory is not naturalistic:
the dynamics is controlled in part by something that is not part of the
physical universe. The present work describes a quantum mechanical model of
brain dynamics in which the quantum selection process is a causal process
governed not by pure chance but rather by a mathematically specified nonlocal
physical process identifiable as the conscious process.
