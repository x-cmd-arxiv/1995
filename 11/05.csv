spiral galaxy is considered. In contrast to previous considerations we show
that the initial density fold should be quasi-one-dimensional (bar-like)
instead of disc-like. The disc component of the galaxies appears only during
the evolution. The model naturally reproduces some essential features of the
galaxies. In particular, it reproduces all the observed typical forms of the
rotation curves for the spiral galaxies with a characteristic minimum and
plateau. It appears that the plateau corresponds to escaping the matter
(external spiral arms, due to initial conditions, have too large velocities to
be confined by the gravitational field of the galaxy). Such a scenario of the
galaxy evolution leads to the conclusion that the hypothesis of the dark matter
is not necessary (at least, for the spiral galaxies).

partner of the electroweak Higgs doublet to be superheavy (with a mass $\sim
M_{GUT}$). We show that this is a very model-dependent statement and the colour
triplet can be as light as the weak doublet without leading to the proton decay
problem: instead of using the mass difference the splitting can occur between
the doublet and triplet Yukawa coupling constants. In this scenario the GUT
symmetry breaking automatically induces an extremely strong suppression $\sim
M_W/M_{GUT}$ of the coloured Higgs effective Yukawa coupling; this happens
without any fine--tuning, just because of the Clebsch factors. Conceptual
differences of the above picture are: (1) an essentially stable proton: both $d
= 5$ and $d = 6$ proton decay mediating operators are suppressed by the same
factors $\sim (M_w/M_{GUT})^2$; (2) the possibility of solving the $\mu$
problem by the light gauge singlet field (this fact would lead to the
destabilization of the hierarchy in the standard case); (3) the existence of
the long--lived, light, coloured and charged supermultiplet in the 100 GeV mass
region. We construct two explicit SO(10) examples with the above properties,
with superpotentials most general under the symmetries.

the extra dimensions are inhomogeneous in such a way that symmetry breaking
Higgs fields aquire vevs only at very localised points on the manifold. These

neutrinos at the intermediate mass scale. Simple formalism is suggested which
incorporates the quark - lepton symmetry and allows one to find properties of
the intermediate scale (masses and mixing) from neutrino data. Averaged mass
scale and the mass hierarchy parameter are introduced and fixed by the data.
They determine natural ranges of masses and mixing at the intermediate scale.
In particular, scenario which includes the MSW solution of the solar neutrino
problem and tau neutrino as the hot component of Dark Matter of the Universe
leads to $M_2 = (2 - 4) \cdot 10^{10}$ GeV and $M_3 = (4 - 8) \cdot 10^{12}$
GeV in agreement with the linear mass hierarchy. Strong deviations from the
natural ranges imply fine tuning of parameters or/and certain symmetry of the
Majorana mass matrix of the right handed neutrinos.

admits a $Z_2$ topological structure. More precisely, we show that this space
contains two disconnected sectors of unstable gauge-Higgs fields odd under a
properly defined generalized parity. This classification extends the
description of baryon and lepton number violating electroweak processes to the
symmetric phase of the theory. Configurations with odd pure-gauge behaviour at
spatial infinity, such as the sphaleron, multisphalerons, electroweak strings
as well as an infinite surface of their equivalents, have half-integer
Chern-Simons number and mediate B+L violating processes in the early universe.
Finite-energy configurations with even pure-gauge behaviour, such as the $S^*$
new sphaleron and electroweak strings, are topologically equivalent to the
vacuum and are irrelevant for B+L violation. We discuss the possible formation
of B+L violating quark-lepton condensates in the symmetric high-temperature
phase of the electroweak theory.

an instanton shrinks to zero size. It is argued here that the answer at the
quantum level is that an extra $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry appears that is supported
in the core of the instanton. Thus in particular the quantum heterotic string
has vacua with higher rank than is possible in conformal field theory. When $k$
instantons collapse at the same point, the enhanced gauge symmetry is $Sp(k)$.
These results, which can be tested by comparison to Dirichlet five-branes of
Type I superstrings and to the ADHM construction of instantons, give the first
example for the heterotic string of a non-perturbative phenomenon that cannot
be turned off by making the coupling smaller. They have applications to several
interesting puzzles about string duality.

gravity coupled to N scalar fields can be expressed in this form, using a
string parametrization, and that it possesses the usual UV fixed point.
However,in this stringy parametrization of the theory the fixed point for the
scalar-dilaton coupling turns out to be trivial, while the fixed point for the
gravitational coupling remains to be the same as in previous studies being, in
particular, non-trivial.

physics, engineering, biology etc. While some questions fall rather naturally
into one of the subject areas in this problem list and may lead to a
publishable paper, other questions may be non- specific or of a transient or
technical quality. Thus we have a section called ``Scratchpad'' for
conversational questions, vaguely formulated questions, or questions to which
you may hope to get a quick answer. In the ``open prize problems'' section, you
are welcome to offer a nice little prize to whoever does it. The miscellaneous
