universe (as in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models), and the universe is at the
critical density, $\Omega_T = 1$, then the data appears to imply a baryon
fraction, $\Omega_{b,x}$ ($\Omega_{b,x}\equiv \Omega_b$ derived from X-ray
cluster data), larger than that predicted by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN).
While various other systematic effects such as clumping can lower
$\Omega_{b,x}$, in this paper we use an elementary analysis to show that a
simple admixture of Hot Dark Matter (HDM, low mass neutrinos) with CDM to yield
mixed dark matter shifts $\Omega_{b,x}$ down so that significant overlap with
$\Omega_b$ from BBN can occur for $H_0 \lsim 75\;{\rm km/sec/Mpc}$, even
without invoking the possible aforementioned effects. The overlap interval is
slightly larger for lower mass neutrinos since fewer cluster on the scale of
the hot X-ray gas. We illustrate this result quantitatively in terms of a
simple isothermal model. More realistic velocity dispersion profiles, with less
centrally-peaked density profiles, imply that fewer neutrinos are trapped and,
thus, further increase the interval of overlap. However, we also note that if
future observations of light element abundances find that $\Omega_b h^2 \lsim
0.018$, the range of concordance in this simple mixed dark matter model
vanishes.

sensitive method for investigating the chemical and physical history of the
very extended ionized nebulae seen around radio galaxies (EELR), massive
ellipticals and `cooling flow' galaxies. By observing the near IR spectrum of
nebular regions characterized by low excitation emission lines (LINER-like), we
can use the intensity of the [CaII]$\lambda\lambda 7291,7324$\AA\ doublet
--relative to other lines, like H$\alpha$-- to infer the amount of Calcium
depletion onto dust grains. The presence of dust in these objects --which does
not necessarily result in a measurable level of extinction-- would favour a
`galactic debris' rather than a `cooling flow' origin for the emitting gas.
Before aplying such test to our data, we study four possible alternative
mechanisms to dust depletion and which could have explained the absence of the
[CaII] lines: a) ionization of Ca$^+$ from its metastable level, b) thermal
ionization of Ca$^+$, c) a high ionization parameter and/or a harder ionizing
contiuum than usually asummed and d) matter bounded models associated to a hard
ionizing continuum. We show that none of these alternative mechanisms explain
the absence of the [CaII] lines, except possibly for the highly ionized EELR
where a high ionization parameter is required combined with a soft power law.
We thus conclude that for the other low excitation emission regions (cooling
flows, liners, low excitation EELR), the abscence of the CaII lines {\it must}
be due to the depletion of Calcium onto dust grains.

these terms. An improvement on the entropy conservation is not found by merely
considering larger numbers of particles or different $N_S$ choices. The correct

the three neutral Higgs bosons of the MSSM decaying into quark-antiquark pairs.
The SUSY-QCD effects turn out to be comparable or even larger than the standard
QCD effects and are slowly decoupling in a wide window of the parameter space.
Our study is aimed at elucidating the possible supersymmetric nature of the
neutral Higgs bosons that might be discovered in the near future at the
Tevatron and/or at the LHC. In particular, we point out the presence of
potentially large SUSY corrections to the various neutral Higgs production
cross-sections.

be replaced with $n$ replicas of $K$, and it is completely saturated if it is
$n$-saturated for each $n\ge 1$. Similarly, a covering $\cal C$ with congruent
replicas of a body $K$ is $n$-reduced if no $n$ members of it can be replaced
by $n-1$ replicas of $K$ without uncovering a portion of the space, and it is
completely reduced if it is $n$-reduced for each $n\ge 1$. We prove that every

proposed. Part I introduces the method of effective dynamical functions as a
generalisation of the optical potential formalism. The method provides a legal
transformation of the Schroedinger equation revealing the hidden
multivaluedness of interaction process, i. e. its self-consistent, dynamical
splitting into many equally real, but mutually incompatible branches, called
'realisations'. Each realisation incorporates the usual ""complete"" set of

obtained set of realisations form the causally derived, intrinsically complete
""space of events"" providing the crucial extension of the notion of probability
and the method of its first-principle calculation. The fundamental dynamic
uncertainty thus revealed is specified for Hamiltonian quantum systems and
applied to quantum chaos description in periodically perturbed systems. The
ordinary semiclassical transition in our quantum-mechanical results leads to
exact reproduction of the main features of chaotic behaviour of the system
known from classical mechanics, which permits one to ""re-establish"" the
correspondence principle for chaotic systems (inevitably lost in any their
conventional, single-valued description). The causal dynamical randomness in
the extended quantum mechanics is not restricted, however, to semiclassical
conditions and generically occurs also in essentially quantum regimes, even

series of papers for the case of Hamiltonian quantum systems, is further
specified to reveal the hierarchical structure of levels of dynamically
redundant 'realisations' which takes the form of the intrinsically
probabilistic 'fundamental dynamical fractal' of a problem and determines
fractal character of the observed quantities. This intrinsic fractality is
obtained as a natural, causally derived property of dynamic behaviour of a
system with interaction and the corresponding complete solution. Every branch
of the fundamental dynamical fractal of a problem, as well as the probability
of its emergence, can be obtained within the extended nonperturbative analysis
of the main dynamic equation (Schroedinger equation in our case), contrary to
basically restricted imitations of fractality within the canonical,
single-valued approach. The results of the dynamical chaos analysis in
Hamiltonian quantum systems, Parts I-III, are then subjected to discussion and
generalisation. The physical origins of the dynamic uncertainty are analysed
from various points of view. The basic consequences, involving essential
extension of the conventional, unitary (= single-valued) quantum mechanics, are
summarised. Finally, we emphasize the universal character of the emerging
notions of dynamic multivaluedness (or redundance), causal randomness (or
dynamic uncertainty), first-principle probability, (non)integrability, general
solution, and physical complexity applicable to real dynamical systems of any
kind.

Parts I-III of this work and used to establish the consistent understanding of
genuine chaos in Hamiltonian systems provides also causal description of the
quantum measurement process. The modified Schroedinger formalism involving
multivalued effective dynamical functions reveals the dynamic origin of quantum
measurement indeterminacy as the intrinsic instability in the compound system
of 'measured object' and (dissipative) 'instrument' with respect to splitting
into spatially localised 'realisations'. As a result, the originally wide
measured wave catastrophically (and really!) ""shrinks"" around a random
accessible point thus losing all its 'nonlocal properties' with respect to
other points/realisations. The dissipativity of one of the interacting objects
(serving as 'instrument') is reduced to its (arbitrarily small) openness
towards other systems (levels of complexity) and determines the difference
between quantum measurement and quantum chaos, the latter corresponding to an
effectively isolated system of interacting (micro-) objects. We do not use any
assumptions on particular ""classical"", ""macroscopic"", ""stochastic"", etc. nature
of the instrument or environment: physical reduction and indeterminacy
dynamically appear already in interaction between two microscopic (quantum)
deterministic systems, the object and the instrument, possessing just a few
degrees of freedom a part of which, belonging to the instrument, should
correspond to locally starting, arbitrarily weak excitation. This dynamically
indeterminate wave reduction occurs in agreement with the postulates of the
conventional quantum mechanics, including the rule of probabilities, which
transforms them into consequences of the dynamic uncertainty.

outlined within a scheme of the complete quantum (wave) mechanics called
quantum field mechanics and completing the original ideas of Louis de Broglie
by the dynamic complexity concept. The total picture includes the formally
complete description at the level of the ""average"" wave function of
Schroedinger type that shows dynamically chaotic behaviour in the form of
either quantum chaos (Parts I-III), or quantum measurement (Part IV) with
causal indeterminacy and wave reduction. This level is only an approximation,
though often sufficient, to a lower (and actually the lowest accessible) level
of complexity containing the causally complete version of the unreduced,
nonlinear ""double solution"" proposed by Louis de Broglie. The extended 'double
solution with chaos' describes the state of a nonlinear material field and
includes the unstable high-intensity ""hump"" moving chaotically within the
embedding smooth wave (quant-ph/9902015,16). The involvement of chaos causally
understood within the same concept of dynamic complexity (multivaluedness)
provides, at this lower level, de Broglie's ""hidden thermodynamics"" now,
however, without the necessity for any real ""hidden thermostat"". The chaotic
reduction of the ""piloting"" Schroedinger wave, at the higher sublevel of
complexity, conforms with the detailed 'wandering' of the virtual soliton at
the lower sublevel. The proposed dynamic multivaluedness (redundance) paradigm
serves as the basis for a self-consistent hierarchic picture of the world with
a (high) non-zero complexity (and thus irreducible randomness), where the
complete extension of quantum mechanics is causally interpreted as several
lowest levels of complexity.
