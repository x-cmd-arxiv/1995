  To appear in Astronomy & Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate the possibility of identifying massive objects (lenses) in the
Galactic Center region (GC) by means of pulsar timing. The well known intensity
change due to microlensing is found to be less important. For typical stellar
masses, the flux magnification can be significant only if the lens passes very
close to the pulsar--Earth axis. We show that in the case of a pulsar the time
varying travel-time delay, which is observable because of the pulsating nature
of pulsar radiation, is a much more powerful tool to investigate mass
distributions in the GC. We find that a travel-time delay is measurable even
for rather large distances between the lens and the pulsar--Earth axis.
  The time varying travel-time delay can be used to determine the mass of the
lens and the ratio of the transverse velocity to the minimum impact parameter.
Based on Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic data sets we give the expected
accuracies in the parameter determination for various masses.
  We argue that pulsars found behind the very center of our Galaxy would
provide an excellent opportunity to test the mass distribution in the Galactic
nucleus, and therefore to distinguish between a super massive black hole (SMBH)
and a super-dense star cluster (SDSC) within the central 0.1 pc.

(i) the t - t' - J model, for which the carrier is a spinless vacancy, and (ii)

is a S = 1/2 hole moving on the Oxygen sublattice, have demonstrated that if
one wishes to describe the quasiparticle throughout the entire first Brillouin

func- tion for a single Oxygen hole in the three-band model: it utilizes a
classical representation of the antiferromagnetically ordered Cu-spin
background but explicitly includes the quantum fluctuations of the lowest
energy doublet of the Cu-O-Cu bond containing the Oxygen hole. We find that
this wave function leads to a quasiparticle dispersion for physical exchange
and hopping parame- ters that is in excellent agreement with the measured ARPES
data. We also obtain the average spin of the Oxygen hole, and thus deduce that
this spin is only quenched to zero at certain wave vectors, helping to explain
the inadequacy of the t - t' - J model to match the experimentally observed
disper- sion relation everywhere in the first Brillouin zone.

de Sitter plane waves in their tube domains which lead to a new integral
representation of the two-point functions and to a Fourier-Laplace type
transformation on the hyperboloid. The Hilbert space structure of these

the embedding variables ${\eta}^a (x)$ and the (intrinsic) induced metric
$g_{\mu \nu}$ on $V_n$. If in the path integral we perform only the functional

baryons as topological solitons in effective chiral meson theories. In the
first part one-loop corrections to the classical tree approximation are
discussed. This involves renormalization of low-energy coupling constants and
evaluation of the finite next-to-leading-order terms in the $1/N_c$ expansion.
Recent results for various nucleon observables are presented. In the second
part electromagnetic nucleon form factors (FFs) with relativistic corrections
are evaluated in a chiral soliton model including vector mesons. The magnetic
FF $G_M^p$ is shown to agree well with new SLAC data for spacelike $Q^2$ up to
30(GeV/c)$^2$ if superconvergence is enforced. The electric FF $G_E^p$ is
dominated by a zero in the few (GeV/c)$^2$ region. The third part describes how
to extract the strong $\pi NN$ form factor from chiral soliton models, taking
due care of the local metric created by the presence of the soliton. When used
in a one-boson-exchange model for the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction,
deuteron properties and phase parameters of NN scattering are reproduced as
well as in conventional NN models that apply a hard monopole form factor at the
$\pi NN$ vertex.

The proof has thwo advantages: first, it is simplier in the most interesting
cases (for example in the so called minimal models), second, it can be
generalized for Neveu-Schwarz algebra for some class of Verma modules.

  Condition in Non-Abelian Gauge Theory","11 pages + 1 uuencoded eps figure, LaTeX",,,"KUNS-1368","hep-th",,"  The ratio Z_1/Z_3 of vertex and wave-function renormalization factors, which
is universal (i.e., matter-independent), is shown to equal 1+u which gives the
residue of the scalar pole $\propto p_\mu p_\nu /p^2$ of 2-point function <
D_\mu c D_\nu \bar c >. This relation is interesting since 1+u=0 has been known
to give a sufficient condition for color confinement. We also give an argument
that, when 1+u=0 holds, it will be realized by the disappearance of the
massless gauge boson pole and is related with the restoration of a certain
``local gauge symmetry"" as was discussed by Hata. (Talk given at International
Symposium on BRS Symmetry, Sept.~18 -- 22, 1995, Kyoto.)
