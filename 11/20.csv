peak nuclei, silicon burning is important to our understanding of the evolution
of massive stars and supernovae. Our reexamination of silicon burning, using
results gleaned from simulation work done with a large nuclear network (299
nuclei and more than 3000 reactions) and from independent calculations of
equilibrium abundance distributions, offers new insights into the
quasi-equilibrium mechanism and the approach to nuclear statistical
equilibrium. We find that the degree to which the matter has been neutronized
is of great importance, not only to the final products but also to the rate of
energy generation and the membership of the quasi-equilibrium groups. A small
increase in the global neutronization results in much larger free neutron
fluences, increasing the abundances of more neutron-rich nuclei. As a result,
incomplete silicon burning results in neutron richness among the isotopes of
the iron peak much larger than the global neutronization would indicate.
Finally, we briefly discuss the limitations and pitfalls of models for silicon
burning currently employed within hydrodynamic models. In a forthcoming paper
we will present a new approximation to the full nuclear network which preserves
the most important features of the large nuclear network calculations at a
significant improvement in computational speed. Such improved methods are
ideally suited for hydrodynamic calculations which involve the production of
iron peak nuclei, where the larger network calculation proves unmanageable.

Analysing both the diffuse background radiation and resolved sources, we have
carried out a series of joint spectral fits of the ASCA and ROSAT data. The
spectrum of the XRB can be fit well by a single power-law from 1 to 7 keV;
overall, the photon index of the power-law model ranges from 1.4 to 1.5, and no
obvious excess is found between 1 and 3 keV. Below 1 keV, the models become
more complicated and involve a mixture of extragalactic and Galactic sources.
As some of the extragalactic contributions should be from point sources, we
have examined the ASCA and ROSAT spectra of resolved sources individually: a
stellar source having a well-fit thermal spectrum and two AGNs having a much
steeper power-law spectrum (with photon index of about 3); the accumulated
spectrum of other non-stellar sources resolved by ROSAT also has a
steeper-than-average spectrum. Fitting the XRB spectrum observed by ASCA and
the accumulated point source spectrum by ROSAT together by varying the
contribution from steep spectrum sources, such as quasars, to the background,
we find that they contribute less than 30 per cent in the 0.5--2 keV band and
drop to below 10 per cent over 2--10 keV. This fraction is provided by sources
brighter than a few times $10^{-15}$ \ergpercmpers (in the 0.5--2 keV band).
Constrained by our spectral fitting results, the major contributor of the XRB

boundaries when the curvature reaches Planckian values. The intersection of the
boundaries is studied and a scenario leading to disconnected de Sitter
universes is proposed. The application to the information loss problem is then
discussed.

and the $\pi \rho$ transition form factor are reported and compared with those
obtained within various relativistic approaches in a range of values of the
four-momentum transfer accessible to $CEBAF$.

reactions by taking non-adiabaticity of the tunnleing process into account. In
order to investigate deviations from the adiabatic limit, we use the dynamical
norm method, which has recently been developed by the present authors. Using
$d$+D reaction as an example, we show that the screening energy never exceeds
those estimated in the adiabatic approximation. Our calculations indicate that
the non-adiabatic effect is important both in classically allowed and
classically forbidden processes.

Math. 121 (1996), 196-244",,,"q-alg math.QA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We begin with a brief sketch of what is known and conjectured concerning
braided monoidal 2-categories and their applications to 4d topological quantum
field theories and 2-tangles (surfaces embedded in 4-dimensional space). Then
we give concise definitions of semistrict monoidal 2-categories and braided
monoidal 2-categories, and show how these may be unpacked to give long explicit
definitions similar to, but not quite the same as, those given by Kapranov and
Voevodsky. Finally, we describe how to construct a semistrict braided monoidal
2-category Z(C) as the `center' of a semistrict monoidal category C. This is
analogous to the construction of a braided monoidal category as the center, or
`quantum double', of a monoidal category. As a corollary, our construction
yields a strictification theorem for braided monoidal 2-categories.

pair of free bodies together with their internal energy is used to show the
existence of states that have localised position while being eigenstates of
energy and momentum. These states are applicable to all varieties of physical
bodies, including planets and stars in free motion in the universe. The states
are compound entanglements of multiple free bodies in which the momenta of the
bodies are anticorrelated so that they always sum to zero, while their total
kinetic energy is anticorrelated with their internal energies, so the total is
a constant, E. The bodies are relatively localised while the total state has
well-defined energy and momentum. These states do not violate Heisenberg
uncertainty because the total centre of mass is not localised, hence the states
naturally describe whole universes rather than isolated systems within a
universe. A further property of these states, resulting from the form of the
entanglement, is that they display nonlocality in the full sense of signal
transmission rather than the more restricted Bell sense.
