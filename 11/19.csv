self-consistent modeling of X-ray clusters, we examine the dependence of both
the mean Compton y parameter and the SZ source counts on Omega_o. These
quantities increase with decreasing Omega_o due to the earlier epoch of
structure formation in low-density cosmogonies; the results depend only on the
quantity of gas heated to the virial temperature of collapsed objects and are
independent of the spatial distribution of the gas in the potential wells.
Specifically, we compare two models which reproduce the present-day abundance
of clusters - a biased, critical universe and an unbiased, open model with
Omega_o=0.3. We find that the mean y parameter approaches the current FIRAS
limit of y<2.5 10^{-5} for the open model, demonstrating the importance of
improving this limit on spectral distortions, and that the SZ source counts and
corresponding redshift distribution differ significantly between the two
cosmogonies; millimeter surveys covering a large area should thus provide
interesting constraints on the density parameter of the Universe and on the
evolution of the heated gas fraction in virialized objects.

order nonlinear correction to the two point correlation and the pair velocity
for Gaussian initial conditions in a critical density matter dominated
cosmological model. We compare our results with the results obtained using the
hydrodynamic equations which neglect pressure and we find that the two match,
indicating that thare are no effects of multistreaming at this order of
perturbation. We analytically study the effect of small scales on the large
scales by calculating the nonlinear correction for a Dirac delta function
initial two point correlation. We find that the induced two point correlation
has a $x^{-6}$ behaviour at large separations. We have considered a class of
initial conditions where the initial power spectrum at small $k$ has the form
$k^n$ with $0 < n \le 3$ and have numerically calculated the nonlinear
correction to the two point correlation, its average over a sphere and the pair
velocity over a large dynamical range. We find that at small separations the
effect of the nonlinear term is to enhance the clustering whereas at
intermediate scales it can act to either increase or decrease the clustering.
At large scales we find a simple formula which gives a very good fit for the
nonlinear correction in terms of the initial function. This formula explicitly
exhibits the influence of small scales on large scales and because of this
coupling the perturbative treatment breaks down at large scales much before one
would expect it to if the nonlinearity were local in real space. We physically
interpret this formula in terms of a simple diffusion process. We have also
investigated the case $n=0$ and we find that it differs from the other cases in
certain respects. We investigate a recently proposed scaling property of

  Golfi, Sept. 1995",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present a selection of ROSAT results on the morphology, the evolution, and
the masses of galaxy clusters and groups. ROSAT provides the first complete
X-ray view on the Virgo cluster: it reveals a complex structure similar to the
optical appearance. Indications for ongoing evolution is found in a number of
clusters traced both by the surface brightness distribution and temperature
variations. With ROSAT data, which provide spatial and spectral resolution at
the same time, good mass estimates can be obtained for various systems from
small groups to very massive clusters covering a mass range of a few $10^{13}$
to $4.6\cdot10^{15}\msol$. The gas to dark matter ratio for clusters is 10-30\%
while for groups slightly smaller values (3-25\%) are found. The most luminous
ROSAT cluster RXJ1347.5-1145 is presented which is an ideal object to compare
the X-ray mass with the mass derived by gravitational lensing.
