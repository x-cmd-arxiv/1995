unstable mass transfer in a close binary, and the subsequent dynamical
evolution and final fate of the envelope. We base our discussion on new
three-dimensional SPH calculations that we have performed for a close binary
system containing a $4\,M_\odot$ red giant with a $0.7\,M_\odot$ main-sequence
star companion. The initial parameters are chosen to model the formation of a
system resembling V~471~Tau, a typical progenitor of a cataclysmic variable
binary. In our highest-resolution calculation, we find evidence for a
corotating region of gas around the central binary. This is in agreement with
the theoretical model proposed by Meyer \& Meyer-Hofmeister (1979) for the
evolution of common envelope systems, in which this central corotating region
is coupled to the envelope through viscous angular momentum transport only. We
also find evidence that the envelope is convectively unstable, in which case
the viscous dissipation time could be as short as $\sim100$ dynamical times,
leading to rapid ejection of the envelope. For V~471~Tau, our results, and the
observed parameters of the system, are entirely consistent with rapid envelope
ejection on a timescale $\sim1\,$yr and an efficiency parameter
$\alpha_{CE}\simeq1$.

gravitational lensing. Previous studies have focused mostly on weak lensing,
since large-scale structure alone cannot produce multiple images. When a galaxy

can produce asymmetric shear of the same order as the lens itself. Indeed, this
may explain the origin of the large shear found in lens models in conflict with
the small ellipticity of the observed galaxy light distributions. We show that
large-scale structure changes the lens equation to the form of a generalized
quadrupole lens, which affects lens reconstruction. Large-scale structure also
changes the angular diameter distance at a given redshift. The precise value
depends on the lens and source redshifts and on the large-scale structure power
spectrum, but the induced $1\sigma$ uncertainty in determinations of the Hubble
constant from measurements of time delays is of order $5-10 \%$. If
observations of lensing can constrain the magnitude of the shear which is due
to large-scale structure, it would provide a direct probe of the overall
amplitude of mass fluctuations.

that all the semi--realistic free fermionic models that have been constructed

first-class ones starting with our method exposed in [Nucl.Phys. B456

systems there exists a standard coupling between the variables of the original
phase-space and some extravariables such that we can transform the original
system into a one-parameter family of first-class systems; ii) the BRST
quantization of this family in a standard gauge leads to the same path integral
as that of the original system. The analysis is accomplished in both reducible
and irreducible cases. In the same time, there is obtained the Lagrangian
action of the first-class family and its provenience is clarified. In this
context, the Wess-Zumino action is also derived. The results from the
theoretical part of the paper are exemplified in detail for the massive
Yang-Mills theory and for the massive abelian three-form gauge fields.

states (DOS) for different self-adjoint extensions is calculated. As in the
nonrelativistic case, whenever a bound state is present in the spectrum it is
always accompanied by a (anti)resonance at the energy. The Aharonov-Casher
theorem must be corrected for singular field configurations. There are no zero
(threshold) modes in the Aharonov-Bohm potential. For our choice of the 2d
Dirac Hamiltonian, the phase-shift flip is shown to occur at only positive
energies. This flip gives rise to a surplus of the DOS at the lower threshold
coming entirely from the continuous part of the spectrum. The results are
applied to several physical quantities: the total energy, induced
fermion-number, and the axial anomaly.
