also measured internal velocities with a rest frame resolution of $\sigma$ = 55

matter halos formed in the standard CDM cosmogony can be fit accurately by
scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. Regardless of their mass, halos are
nearly isothermal over a large range in radius, but significantly shallower
than $r^{-2}$ near the center and steeper than $r^{-2}$ in the outer regions.
The characteristic overdensity of a halo correlates strongly with halo mass in
a manner consistent with the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation.
Matching the shape of the rotation curves of disk galaxies with this halo
structure requires (i) disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically
with luminosity, (ii) halo circular velocities to be systematically lower than
the disk rotation speed, and (iii) that the masses of halos surrounding bright
galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity. This offers an attractive
explanation for the puzzling lack of correlation between luminosity and
dynamics in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite companions of
bright spiral galaxies, suggesting that the structure of dark matter halos
surrounding bright spirals is similar to that of cold dark matter halos.

extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars. The EHB stars spend most of their He
core and shell burning phase at high temperatures and produce copious
ultraviolet flux. They have very small hydrogen envelopes and occupy a small
range in mass. We have computed evolutionary RGB models with mass loss for
stars with a range of metallicities at initial masses < 1.1 Msun corresponding
to populations ages between 12.5 and 14.5 Gyr. We used the Reimers formula to
characterize mass loss, but investigated a larger range of the mass loss
efficiency parameter, eta, than is common. To understand how the number of EHB
stars varies with metallicity in a stellar population we considered how the
zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB) is populated. The range in eta producing EHB
stars is comparable to that producing `mid-HB' stars. Somewhat surprisingly,
neither the range nor magnitude of eta producing EHB stars varies much
metallicity. In contrast, the range of eta producing mid-HB stars decreases
with increasing metallicity. Hence the HB of populations with solar metallicity
and higher, such as expected in elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges, will be
bimodal if the distribution covers a sufficiently large range in eta.

range of scales, these are then ordered in decreasing density and a merger tree
constructed. The method is similar in many respects to the block model of Cole
\& Kaiser but has a number of advantages: (i) it retains information about the
spatial correlations between halos, (ii) it uses a series of overlapping grids
and is thereby much better at finding rare, high-mass halos, (iii) it is not
limited to halos whose mass ratios are powers of two, and (iv) it is based on
an actual realization of the density field and so can be tested against N-body
simulations. The major disadvantages are (i) the minimum halo mass is eight
times the unit cell with a corresponding loss of dynamic range, and (ii)
occasionally the relative location of halos in the tree does not reflect the
correct ordering of their collapse times, as computed from the mean halo
density. We show that our model exhibits the required scaling behaviour when
tested on power-law spectra of density perturbations, but that it predicts far
more massive halos than does the Press-Schechter formalism for flat spectra. We
suggest reasons why this should be so.

systems (small particles, nanomagnetic devices, etc.) must relax quantum
mechanically. This quantum relaxation must be mediated by the coupling to both
nuclear spins and phonons (and electrons if either particle or substrate is
conducting. We analyze the effect of each of these couplings, and then combine
them. Conducting systems can be modelled by a ""giant Kondo"" Hamiltonian, with
nuclear spins added in as well. At low temperatures, even microscopic particles
on a conducting substrate (containing only $10-50$ spins) will have their
magnetisation frozen over millenia by a combination of electronic dissipation
and the ""degeneracy blocking"" caused by nuclear spins. Raising the temperature
leads to a sudden unblocking of the spin dynamics at a well defined
temperature. Insulating systems are quite different. The relaxation is strongly
enhanced by the coupling to nuclear spins. At short times the magnetisation of
an ensemble of particles relaxes logarithmically in time, after an initial very
fast decay; this relaxation proceeds entirely via the nuclear spins. At longer
times phonons take over, but the decay rate is still governed by the
temperature-dependent nuclear bias field acting on the particles - decay may be
exponential or power-law depending on the temperature. The most surprising
feature of the results is the pivotal role played by the nuclear spins. The
results are relevant to any experiments on magnetic particles in which
interparticle dipolar interactions are unimportant. They are also relevant to
future magnetic device technology.

Important phenomena involved are Sudakov's suppression of no radiation of that

transparency, which suppresses the final state interaction of the produced
colorless wave packet. We model the soft part of hadronization, which usually
is supposed to be due to the color strings, using also the gluon radiation and
nicely reproduce the string parameters. Our parameter-free calculations provide
a good agreement with available data on $z_h$-dependence of the quark

decay can be collision induced if the energy is sufficient for the barrier to
be traversed. We present a classical solution to the Minkowski space equations
of motion in which a soliton is kicked over the barrier by an incoming pulse.
This pulse corresponds to a quantum coherent state with mean number of $W$
quanta $\sim 2.5/g^2$ where $g$ is the $SU(2)$ gauge coupling constant. We also
give a self-contained treatment of the relationship between classical
solutions, including those in which solitons are destroyed, and tree-level
quantum amplitudes. Furthermore, we consider a limit in which we can reliably
estimate the amplitude for soliton decay induced by collision with a single
$W$-boson. This amplitude depends on $g$ like $\exp (-cg^{-1/3})$, and is
larger than that for spontaneous decay via tunnelling in the same limit.
Finally we show that in soliton decays, light $SU(2)_L$ doublet fermions are
anomalously produced. Thus we have a calculation of a two body process with

absence of a Chern-Simons term in the action. We also give relations among
these quantities and the vacuum energy and gauge-boson mass. Both the
susceptibility and the string tension come from the same physics: The topology
of linking, twisting, and writhing of closed vortex strings. The closed-vortex
string is described via a complex scalar field theory whose action has a
precisely-specified functional form, inferred from previous work giving the
exact form of a gauge-theory effective potential at low momentum. Applications
to high-T phenomena, including B+L anomalous violation, are mentioned.

condensation coupled to the dilaton for string models in which the gauge
coupling constant does not receive string threshold corrections. The new
ingredients in our treatment are that we take into account the one-loop
correction to the dilaton K\""ahler potential and we use a formulation which
includes a chiral field $H$ corresponding to the gaugino bilinear. We find
through explicit calculation that supersymmetry in the Yang-Mills sector is
broken by gaugino condensation.
  The dilaton and $H$ field have masses on the order of the gaugino
condensation scale independently of the dilaton VEV. Although the calculation
performed here is at best a model of the full gaugino condensation dynamics,
the result shows that the one-loop correction to the dilaton K\""ahler potential
as well as the detailed dynamics at the gaugino condensation scale may play an
important role in solving the dilaton runaway problem.

approximation. In the present paper we consider the influence of the mesonic
correlations on the quark self-energy and on the quark propagator within a
systematic $1/N_c$- expansion. Using a general separable ansatz for the
nonlocal interaction, we derive a selfconsistent equation for the $1/N_c$
correction to the quark propagator. For a separable model with cut-off
formfactor, we obtain a decrease of the condensate of the order of 20\% at zero
temperature. A lowering the critical temperature for the onset of the chiral
restoration transition due to the inclusion of mesonic correlations is obtained
what seems to be closer to the results from lattice calculations.
