kinematic and radiation transfer model. Our results support the accretion disk
origin of winds in non-magnetic CVs as opposite to the WD origin. Our main
point concerns the importance of rotation for the UV emission line shapes in
such systems. In particular, we show that the narrowing of the UV emission
lines in V347 Pup during eclipse can be easily explained by the eclipse of the
innermost part of the wind by the secondary and the resulting reduction in the
contribution of rotational broadening to the width of the lines. During the
eclipse, the residual line flux is very sensitive to the maximal temperature of
disk radiation. Good fits for reasonable mass-loss rates have been obtained for
maximum disk temperatures of 50,000 degrees. This constraint was imposed either
by leveling off the inner disk temperature profiles, in agreement with recent
observations of some nova-like objects, or by assuming that the accretion disk
does not extend to the surface of the white dwarf, in which case V347 up would
be an intermediate polar. In anticipation of high-speed spectrophotometry of
CVs by the HST, we provide numerical model of a time-resolved eclipse of V347

one another. Extinction-corrected luminosity and diameter functions are derived

their characteristic radius a = 10 h^{-1} Mpc (H_0 = 100 h km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}).
It is shown that the higher density of normal galaxies and AGNs around clusters
cannot be responsible for the increased X-ray emission. This is because it
would produce a signal in the autocorrelation function measurable by the Ginga
LAC experiment. Apparent extended emission could be produced either by a number
of discrete sources associated with groups of galaxies concentrated around rich

Type-II superconductor with a bulk current $\vec J$. In the absence of
transverse fluctuations, the system reduces to recently studied models of
interface depinning. In most cases, the presence of transverse fluctuations are
found not to influence the critical exponents that describe longitudinal
correlations. For a manifold with $d=4-\epsilon$ internal dimensions,
longitudinal fluctuations in an isotropic medium are described by a roughness
exponent $\zeta_\parallel=\epsilon/3$ to all orders in $\epsilon$, and a
dynamical exponent $z_\parallel=2-2\epsilon/9+O(\epsilon^2)$. Transverse
fluctuations have a distinct and smaller roughness exponent
$\zeta_\perp=\zeta_\parallel-d/2$ for an isotropic medium. Furthermore, their
relaxation is much slower, characterized by a dynamical exponent
$z_\perp=z_\parallel+1/\nu$, where $\nu=1/(2-\zeta_\parallel)$ is the
correlation length exponent. The predicted exponents agree well with numerical
results for a flux line in three dimensions. As in the case of interface
depinning models, anisotropy leads to additional universality classes. A
nonzero Hall angle, which has no analogue in the interface models, also affects
the critical behavior.

influence functional technique, we trace out the graviton field, to obtain a
master equation for the system of particles to first order in $G$. The
effective interaction between the particles, as well as the self-interaction is
non-local in time and in general non-markovian. We show that the gravitational
self-interaction cannot be held responsible for decoherence of microscopic
particles due to the fast vanishing of the diffusion function. For macroscopic
particles though, it leads to diagonalization to the energy eigenstate basis, a
desirable feature in gravity induced collapse models. We finally comment on
possible applications.

advocates a conceptually sounder alternative: complex lapse. In the ``3+1''
action for the Einstein gravitational field minimally coupled to a Klein-Gordon
field, allowing the lapse function to be complex yields a complex action which
generates both the usual Lorentzian theory and its Riemannian analogue, and in
particular allows a change of signature between the two. The action and
variational equations are manifestly well defined in the Hamiltonian
representation, with the momentum fields consequently being complex. The
complex action interpolates between the Lorentzian and Riemannian actions as
they appear formally in the respective path integrals. Thus the complex-lapse
theory provides a unified basis for a path-integral quantum theory of gravity
involving both Lorentzian and Riemannian aspects. A major motivation is the
quantum-tunnelling scenario for the origin of the universe. Taken as an
explanation for the observed quantum tunnelling of particles, the complex-lapse
theory determines that the argument of the lapse for the universe now is
extremely small but negative.

types of generalized 2d dilaton gravity. E.g. in one version, the dilaton field
is shown to be expressible by the extra scalar curvature, constructed for an
independent Lorentz connection corresponding to a nontrivial torsion.
Elimination of that dilaton field yields an equivalent torsionless theory,
nonpolynomial in curvature. These theories, although locally equivalent exhibit
quite different global properties of the general solution. We discuss the
example of a (torsionless) dilaton theory equivalent to the $R^2 + T^2$--model.
Each global solution of this model is shown to split into a set of global
solutions of generalized dilaton gravity. In contrast to the theory with
torsion the equivalent dilaton one exhibits solutions which are asymptotically
flat in special ranges of the parameters. In the simplest case of ordinary
dilaton gravity we clarify the well known problem of removing the Schwarzschild

the energy release of the decay is small. But the very smallness of the energy
release implies that the Coulomb interactions of the slowly moving emitted beta
electron are relatively large. Using field theoretic techniques, we derive a
systematic and controlled expansion which accounts for the Coulomb effects,
including the mutual interaction of the beta ray electron and the electron in
the final $^3{\rm He}^+$ ion. In our formulation, an effective potential which
describes the long range Coulomb force experienced by the beta ray is
introduced to ensure that our expansion is free of infrared divergences. Both
the exclusive differential decay rate to a specific final $^3{\rm He}^+$ state
and the inclusive differential decay rate are calculated to order $\eta^2$,
where $\eta$ is the usual Coulomb parameter. We analyze the order $\eta^2$
correction to the beta ray spectrum and estimate how it may affect the neutrino
mass squared parameter and the endpoint energy when this corrected spectrum is
used to compare with the experiments. We find that the effect is small.

Ansatz (TBA), where we use that the 2-particle $S$-matrices satisfy a free
fermion condition. Our analysis proves a conjecture by E.~Melzer, who proposed
that these $N\!=\!1$ supersymmetric TBA systems are ``folded'' versions of
$N\!=\!2$ supersymmetric TBA systems that were first studied by P.~Fendley and
K.~Intriligator.

basic hypergeometric series that is known to satisfy a transformation. We call
this $\Phi$ and show that it satisfies certain three-term contiguous relations.
From two sets of contiguous relations for $\Phi$ we obtain fifty-six pairwise
linearly independent solutions to a three-term recurrence that generalizes the
recurrence for Askey-Wilson polynomials. The associated continued fraction is
evaluated using Pincherle's theorem. From this continued fraction we are able
to derive a discrete system of biorthogonal rational functions. This ties
together Wilson's results for rational biorthogonality, Watson's $q$-analogue
of Ramanujan's Entry 40 continued fraction and a conjecture of Askey concerning
the latter. Some new $q$-series identities are also obtained. One is an
important three-term transformation for $\Phi$'s which generalizes all the
known two and three-term $\ephis$ transformations. Others are new and
unexpected quadratic identities for these very-well-poised $\ephis$'s.

appears as the `positive root space', $H$ as the `Cartan subalgebra' and the
dual braided group $B^*$ as the `negative root space' of $U(B)$. The choice
$B=f$ recovers Lusztig's construction of $U_q(g)$, where $f$ is Lusztig's
algebra associated to a Cartan datum; other choices give more novel quantum
groups. As an application, our construction provides a canonical way of
building up quantum groups from smaller ones by repeatedly extending their
positive and negative root spaces by linear braided groups; we explicitly
construct $U_q(sl_3)$ from $U_q(sl_2)$ by this method, extending it by the
quantum-braided plane $A_q^2$. We provide a fundamental representation of
$U(B)$ in $B$. A projection from the quantum double, a theory of double

correlations along with the hypothesis of the impossibility of superluminal
communication (ISC) have the effect of globalizing gross features of the
quantum formalism making them universally true. In particular, these hypotheses
imply that state transformations of density matrices must be linear and that
evolution which preserves purity of states must also be linear. A gedanken
experiment shows that lorentz covariance along with the second law of
thermodynamics imply a non-entropic version of ISC. Partial results using
quantum logic suggest, given ISC and a version of CH, a connection between
lorentz covariance and the covering law. These results show that standard
quantum mechanics is structurally unstable, and suggest that viable
relativistic alternatives must question CH. One may also speculate that some
features of the hilbert-space model of quantum mechanics have their origin in
space-time structure.
