in a viral spread is simulated by a general forest fire like cellular automaton
model with two distinct populations of cells ( permissive and resistant ones)
and studied in the framework of the mean field approximation. Stochastic
dynamical ingredients are introduced in this model to mimic cells regeneration
(with probability {\it p}) and to consider infection processes by other means
than contiguity (with probability {\it f}). Simulations are carried on a $L
\times L$ square lattice considering the eigth first neighbors. The mean
density population of infected cells ($D_i$) is measured as function of the
regeneration probability {\it p}, and analized for small values of the ratio
{\it f/p } and for distinct degrees of the cell resistance. The results
obtained by a mean field like approach recovers the simulations results. The
role of the resistant parameter $R$ ($R \geq 2)$ on the steady state properties
is investigated and discussed in comparision with the $R=1$ monocell case which
corresponds to the {\em self organized critical} forest fire model. The fractal
dimension of the dead cells ulcers contours were also estimated and analised as

scale $T_c$ has its origin in the k-space locality of the inter layer pair
tunneling matrix elements. We reinterpret the same physics as a process of
resonant pair tunneling and illustrate it through cooper pair analysis. This
interpretation is used to give a mechanism which leads to a singular
suppression of $T_c$ as function of c-axis(off plane/axis) disorder. In this
mechanism the non resonant tunneling processes arising from the c-axis disorder
in general contributes a pair binding energy which is reduced by a factor
$\frac{T_J}{\epsilon_F}$, where $T_J$ is the interlayer pair tunneling matrix
element and $\epsilon_F$ is the fermi energy. This leads to a simple theorem
which states that the scale of $T_c$ is controlled by the space average value
of the bare one electron interlayer hoping matrix element. After briefly
discussing that the ET and TMTSF molecule based organic superconductors are
strongly correlated narrow band systems, the dramatic reduction of $T_c$ by
anion disorder in organic superconductors is explained by our mechanism. Off

considerably extending the range and statistics of their study we find that

presence of finite-size scaling corrections. To circumvent this obstacle we
suggest a new scaling Ansatz which in principle should be able to predict both,

our investigation shows that within the achievable accuracy the numerical

quantum string theory. In the classical theory one requires an infinite number
of fields in addition to the collective field to describe ``folds'' on the
fermi surface. We argue that in the quantum theory these are not additional
degrees of freedom. Rather they represent quantum dispersions of the collective
field which are {\em not} suppressed when $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ whenever a fold
is present, thus leading to a nontrivial classical limit. The second issue
relates to the ultraviolet properties of the geometric entropy. We argue that
the geometric entropy is finite in the ultraviolet due to {\em nonperturbative}
effects. This indicates that the true degrees of freedom of the two dimensional
string at high energies is much smaller than what one naively expects.

several conditions previously proposed and known to imply versions of the PCT

string theory compactified on a six-torus by scattering a massless scalar off
it and comparing with the corresponding experiment in which the EBPS state is
replaced by a classical extremal black hole background satisfying the BPS
condition. We find that the low energy limit of the scattering amplitudes
precisely agree if one takes the limit $m_{\rm bh} >> m_P$. In the classical
experiment, beyond a certain frequency of the incident wave, part of the wave
is found to be absorbed by the black hole, whereas in case of the string
scattering there is a critical frequency (inelastic threshold) of the probe
beyond which the EBPS state gets excited to a higher mass non-BPS elementary
state. The classical absorption threshold matches exactly with the inelastic
threshold in the limit of maximum degeneracy of the EBPS state of a given mass.
In that limit we can therefore identify absorption by the black hole as
excitation of the elementary string state to the next vibrational state of the
string and consequently also identify the non-BPS string state as a
non-extremal black hole.

density of symmetric nuclear matter at finite temperatures. In particular, the
behaviour of these quantities at temperatures above and close to the critical
temperature for the superfluid phase transition in nuclear matter is discussed.
It is shown how the singularity in the thermodynamic T-matrix at the critical
temperature for superfluidity (Thouless criterion) reflects in the selfenergy
and correspondingly in the spectral function. The real part of the on-shell
selfenergy (optical potential) shows an anomalous behaviour for momenta near
the Fermi momentum and temperatures close to the critical temperature related
to the pairing singularity in the imaginary part. For comparison the selfenergy
derived from the K-matrix of Brueckner theory is also calculated. It is found,
that there is no pairing singularity in the imaginary part of the selfenergy in
this case, which is due to the neglect of hole-hole scattering in the K-matrix.
From the selfenergy the spectral function and the occupation numbers for finite
temperatures are calculated.

theoretical and phenomenological results. Whereas the quark model predicts two
such resonances around 1.6 GeV, there is considerable evidence for a third
$S_{11}$ resonance in this energy range. This suggests that a $K\Sigma$ or
$K\Lambda$ quasi-bound state may indeed exist below the kaon production
threshold. We show that kaon production experiments, in particular $K^0$
photoproduction off nucleons, would be very sensitive to the existence of the
third $S_{11}$ resonance.

Input--output relations are derived, with special emphasis on the determination

inside the dielectric matter. The input--output relations are used to express
arbitrary correlation functions of the outgoing field in terms of correlation
functions of the incoming field and those of the noise generators. To
illustrate the theory, the effect of a single-slab plate on the mean
photon-number densities in the frequency domain is discussed in more detail.
