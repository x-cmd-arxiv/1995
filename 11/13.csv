we have studied the properties of emission-line galaxies (ELG) in clusters. The
fraction of ELG in clusters is 16~\%; this fraction is slightly dependent on
the cluster velocity dispersion, being larger for ``colder'' systems. ELG tend
to occur more frequently than other cluster galaxies in substructures. However,
only a minor cluster fraction has an ELG population with a mean velocity
significantly different from that of the overall cluster population. The
velocity distribution of cluster ELG is broader than that of the other cluster
galaxies, which translates in a larger observed velocity dispersion. The
velocity distribution for ELG in the inner cluster regions suggests that ELG
are on mostly radial orbits.

Dynamics of Rich Galaxy Clusters' (or ENACS). The final database contains a
total of 5634 galaxies in the directions of 107 clusters from the ACO catalogue
with richness $R\ge 1$ and mean redshifts $z \le 0.1$. Of the 5634 redshifts,
4465 are based on absorption lines only, 583 on emission lines only and 586 on
both. The overall reliability of the 5634 accepted redshifts is 0.98. For 5615
galaxies an $R_{25}$ magnitude was obtained. We discuss various methods for
defining the compact, physically relevant systems in the 107 `pencil-beam'
surveys. We have chosen to apply a fixed velocity gap of 1000 km/s to separate
galaxies that do not form part of the same system. With this gap size, systems
are not broken up into sub-systems, and field galaxies are hardly linked to the
systems. We present the mean redshifts of the 220 systems (with at least 4
members) identified in the 107 pencil beam surveys. On average, about 75~\% of
the 5634 galaxies are in the largest system found in the direction of the rich
Abell cluster candidate. Half of the 25~\% of galaxies outside the largest
system belong to a secondary system along the same line of sight. For about
90~\% of the nearby rich Abell cluster candidates studied here we find a
redshift system that either contains more than half of the total number of
redshifts, or that has at least two times as many redshifts as the next largest
system.

Survey (the ENACS) with another 1000 redshifts from the literature we are able
to study the distribution of velocity dispersions for a volume-limited sample
of 128 $R_{\rm ACO} \geq 1$ clusters, out to a redshift $z=0.1$, in a solid
angle of 2.55 sr centered on the South Galactic Pole. In deriving velocity
dispersions we apply a new, physically motivated method for removing fore- and
background galaxies. We discuss in detail the completeness of the cluster
sample for which we derive the distribution of cluster velocity dispersions.
The large apparent spread between velocity dispersion and richness must be
largely intrinsic. A consequence of the very broad relation between richness
and velocity dispersion is that all cluster samples complete in richness are
biased against low dispersions. For the richness limit of our sample this bias
operates below about 800 km/sec. Above 800 km/s, our distribution of global
velocity dispersions is free from systematic errors and biases, and agrees very
well with the most recent determination of the distribution of cluster X-ray
temperatures. Therefore, we conclude that X-ray temperature and velocity
dispersion distributions statistically measure the same cluster property. We
stress the need for model predictions that produce exactly the same information
as provided by the observations, for a sample of model clusters with a richness
limit that mimics that of the sample of observed clusters.

accurately, with the loss however of about 15--20$\%$ of the total 3D dipole
amplitude. Furthermore, using a simple argument based on linear perturbation
theory, on the linear biasing assumption and on the amplitude of the cluster
dipole relative to that of galaxies, we can estimate their relative biasing
factors quite accurately and in agreement with results obtained by other

observations, based on linear and quasi-linear theory. We assume a critical
matter density, and study both cold dark matter models and cold plus hot dark
matter models. We explore a wide range of parameters, by varying the fraction
of hot dark matter $\Omega_{\nu}$, the Hubble parameter $h$ and the spectral
index of density perturbations $n$, and allowing for the possibility of
gravitational waves from inflation influencing large-angle microwave background
anisotropies. New calculations are made of the transfer functions describing
the linear power spectrum, with special emphasis on improving the accuracy on
short scales where there are strong constraints. For assessing early object
formation, the transfer functions are explicitly evaluated at the appropriate
redshift. The observations considered are the four-year {\it COBE} observations
of microwave background anisotropies, peculiar velocity flows, the galaxy
correlation function, and the abundances of galaxy clusters, quasars and damped
Lyman alpha systems. Each observation is interpreted in terms of the power
spectrum filtered by a top-hat window function. We find that there remains a
viable region of parameter space for critical-density models when all the dark
matter is cold, though $h$ must be less than 0.5 before any fit is found and
$n$ significantly below unity is preferred. Once a hot dark matter component is
invoked, a wide parameter space is acceptable, including $n\simeq 1$. The
allowed region is characterized by $\Omega_\nu \la 0.35$ and $0.60 \la n \la
1.25$, at 95 per cent confidence on at least one piece of data. There is no
useful lower bound on $h$, and for curious combinations of the other parameters
it is possible to fit the data with $h$ as high as 0.65.

recent photoemission experiments on high $T_c$ cuprates in which it is found
that for the optimally doped material the experimental Fermi surface passes
near a van Hove singularity, while for underdoped materials, a pseudogap in the
electron spectral function is formed in the vicinity of the van Hove point. We
show theoretically that proximity to the van Hove singularity suppresses the
inelastic scattering due to the gauge field and permits the formation of a
d-wave RVB state in which the gap exists only near the van Hove points while
finite regions of the Fermi surface remain gapless. This $d$-wave pairing
provides a natural explanation of the pseudogap observed in photoemission. We
also discuss the relation of the pseudogap observed in the spectral function to
the pseudogaps observed in the magnetic susceptibility.

quantum fluctuations are smaller than the experimental error associated with
measuring them. An approximation to a fully quantum theory is described in
which the self-interference of such ``quasiclassical'' variables is neglected
so that they behave classically when not coupled to other quantum variables.
Coupling to quantum variables can lead to evolution in which quasiclassical
variables do not have definite values, but values which are correlated to the
state of the quantum variables. A mathematical description implementing this
backreaction of the quantum variables on the quasiclassical variables is
critically discussed.
