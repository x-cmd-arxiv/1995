in synchronous and comoving coordinates. All the equations are written in terms
of the metric tensor of spatial sections orthogonal to the flow, which allows
an unambiguous expansion in powers of $1/c^2$. To lowest order, the Newtonian
approximation in Lagrangian form is derived. At this level the evolution is
governed by the Raychaudhuri equation for the Lagrangian-to-Eulerian Jacobian
matrix. The Lagrangian spatial metric reduces to that of Euclidean 3-space in
time-dependent curvilinear coordinates. A Lagrangian version of the Bernoulli
equation for the evolution of the `velocity potential' is also given. At the
post-Newtonian (PN) level, an exact and general formula is derived for
gravitational-wave emission from non-linear perturbations. It is shown that, in
the anisotropic collapse of homogeneous ellipsoids, the ratio of the PN tensor
modes to the Newtonian metric tends to diverge like the mass density. It is
finally argued that a stochastic gravitational-wave background is produced,
with present-day closure density $\Omega_{gw} \sim 10^{-5}$ -- $10^{-6}$ on $1$

small radius limit where the particle orbits become nearly pressure-free. We
generalize previous solutions to simultaneously include the effects of both
radiation pressure and angular momentum. The effects of radiation pressure can
be modeled using a modified potential; for representative cases of such
potentials, we obtain analytical solutions for the density and velocity fields.
In general, radiation pressure limits the maximum mass of a forming star by
reversing the infall when the star becomes sufficiently large. Our results
imply that this maximum mass scale is given by the condition that the
turnaround radius $R_R$ (the radius at which the radiation pressure force
exceeds the gravitational force) exceeds the centrifugal radius $R_C$ (the
angular momentum barrier). The maximum mass scale for a star forming within a
rotating collapse flow with radiation pressure depends on the initial
conditions, but is generally much larger than for the case of spherical infall
considered previously. In particular, stars with masses $M_\ast$ $\sim 100$
$M_\odot$ can form for a fairly wide range of initial conditions.

function of the perpendicular component, in good qualitative agreement with
experimental observations. The main source of this effect is the strong
variation of the electronic scattering rate around the Fermi contour which is
associated with the variation in the mean distance of the electronic states
from the remote impurities. The magnitude of the positive magnetoresistance is
strongly correlated with the residual acceptor impurity density in the GaAs

rigid wave function. For interbarrier distances smaller than $d_0=\pi\xi(T)$ no
current-carrying solutions exist. For distances between $d_0$ and $2d_0$, four
solutions exist. The two symmetric solutions obey a current-phase relation of
$\sin(\Delta\varphi/2)$, while the two asymmetric solutions satisfy
$\Delta\varphi=\pi$ for all allowed values of the current. As the distance

and gluon degrees of freedom. In practice, the direct application of QCD to
reactions involving the structure of hadrons is complex because of the
interplay of nonperturbative effects such as color confinement and multi-quark
coherence. A crucial tool in analyzing such phenomena is the use of
relativistic light-cone quantum mechanics and Fock state methods to provide
tractable and consistent treatments of relativistic many-body systems. We begin
with a brief introduction to light-cone field theory, stressing how it may
allow the derivation of a constituent picture, analogous to the constituent
quark model. The Fock state representation includes all quantum fluctuations of
the hadron wavefunction, including far off-shell configurations such as
intrinsic charm and, in the case of nuclei, hidden color. The Fock state
components of the hadron with small transverse size, which dominate hard
exclusive reactions, have small color dipole moments. Thus QCD predicts minimal
absorptive corrections, i.e., color transparency for quasi-elastic exclusive
reactions in nuclear targets at large momentum transfer. In other applications,
such as the calculation of the axial, magnetic, and quadrupole moments of light
nuclei, the QCD Fock state description provides new insights which go well
beyond traditional hadronic and nuclear physics.

the radiative corrections (or by competing non-renormalizable operators), when

not-too-impure entangled states ({\em e.g.} singlets shared through a noisy
channel), can prepare a smaller number of entangled pairs of arbitrarily high
purity ({\em e.g.} near-perfect singlets). These can then be used to faithfully
teleport unknown quantum states from one observer to the other, thereby
achieving faithful transfrom one observer to the other, thereby achieving
faithful transmission of quantum information through a noisy channel. We give
upper and lower bounds on the yield $D(M)$ of pure singlets ($\ket{\Psi^-}$)
distillable from mixed states $M$, showing $D(M)>0$ if
$\bra{\Psi^-}M\ket{\Psi^-}>\half$.

formalism from the classical one. We now turn our attention to the derivation
of the second quantized equations, both for integral and half-integral spins.
We then show that all the quantum results may be derived using our approach and
also show the interpretation suggested by this derivation. This paper may be
considered as a first approach to the study of the quantum field theory
beginning by the same classical ideas we are supporting since the first paper
of this series.

Josephson effect and intralayer disequilibrium in one-dimensional array of
Josephson coupled layers. We show that ``nonequilibrium coupling'' can lead to
effective spatial and time synchronization and formation of coherent dynamic
resistive state (collective Josephson effect) in Nb-AlO-Nb stacked junctions
and HTSC (intrinsic Josephson effect). We propose it to be the origin of
collective switching phenomena observed in PbBiSrCaCuO.
