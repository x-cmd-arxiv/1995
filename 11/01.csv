estimate of the binary frequency for stars near the turnoff in Draco and UMi is
0.2--0.3 per decade of period in the vicinity of periods of one year, which is
3--5$\times$ that found for the solar neighborhood. This frequency is high
enough that binary stars might significantly affect the measured velocity
dispersions of some dwarf spheroidal galaxies according to some previous
numerical experiments. However, in the course of performing our own
experiments, we discovered that this previous work had inadvertently
overestimated binary orbital velocities. Our first set of simulations of the
effects of binaries is based on the observed scatter in the individual velocity
measurements for the multiply-observed Draco and Ursa Minor stars. This scatter
is small compared to measured velocity dispersions and, so, the effect of
binaries on the dispersions is slight. This result is supported by our second
set of experiments, which are based on a model binary population normalized by
the observed binary frequency in Draco and Ursa Minor. We conclude that binary
stars have had no significant effect on the measured velocity dispersion and

  It turns out, that in the center of the dark haloes the gas accumulates to
form a rotationally supported disk. However, in comparison with observations,
disks which form in numerical simulations are too concentrated: Due to the
merging of substructures, angular momentum is transported from the gas to the
dark halo, and far too much gas is accumulated at very small radii. It is
argued that changing the cosmogony (e.g. to low Omega) or adding
photoionisation due to an external UV background do not provide an easy fix to
the angular momentum problem. Feedback processes caused by supernovae or
stellar winds seem to be the most likely solution to this problem.

generalization of the gaussian model, we have also investigated the linear

decrease of the ratio $M_{\rm HI}/D_{\rm o}^2$ with increasing galaxy size for

  271-324",,,"cs.AI",,"  This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive
tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a
flexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an
instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in
whatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the
agent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of
instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves
such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It
combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each
instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete
explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar
that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from
interactive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key
requirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous
systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point;
(2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to
a hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance,
conditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class
of knowledge it uses to perform tasks.

particular class of relativistic dissipative fluid theories of divergence type.
This set is defined as those theories coming from a statistical description of
matter, in the sense that the three tensor fields appearing in the theory can
be expressed as the three first momenta of a suitable distribution function. In
this set of theories the causality condition for the resulting system of
hyperbolic partial differential equations is very simple and allow to identify
a subclass of manifestly causal theories, which are so for all states outside
equilibrium for which the theory preserves this statistical interpretation
condition. This subclass includes the usual equilibrium distributions, namely
Boltzmann, Bose or Fermi distributions, according to the statistics used,
suitably generalized outside equilibrium. Therefore this gives a simple proof
that they are causal in a neighborhood of equilibrium. We also find a bigger
set of dissipative divergence type theories which are only pseudo-statistical,
in the sense that the third rank tensor of the fluid theory has the symmetry
and trace properties of a third momentum of an statistical distribution, but
the energy-momentum tensor, while having the form of a second momentum
distribution, it is so for a different distribution function. This set also
contains a subclass (including the one already mentioned) of manifestly causal

to the minimum local characteristic radius of curvature or the distance to any

larger than Planck size or that there is a large discrepancy in the length
scales which characterize the wormhole. In the latter case, the negative energy

hole is considered. If a part of an infinitely long string passes close to a
black hole it can be captured. The final stationary configurations of such
captured strings are investigated. A uniqueness theorem is proved, namely it is
shown that the minimal 2-D surface $\Sigma$ describing a captured stationary
string coincides with a {\it principal Killing surface}, i.e. a surface formed
by Killing trajectories passing through a principal null ray of the Kerr-Newman
geometry. Geometrical properties of principal Killing surfaces are investigated
and it is shown that the internal geometry of $\Sigma$ coincides with the
geometry of a 2-D black or white hole ({\it string hole}). The equations for
propagation of string perturbations are shown to be identical with the
equations for a coupled pair of scalar fields 'living' in the spacetime of a
2-D string hole. Some interesting features of physics of 2-D string holes are
described. In particular, it is shown that the existence of the extra
dimensions of the surrounding spacetime makes interaction possible between the
interior and exterior of a string black hole; from the point of view of the 2-D
geometry this interaction is acausal. Possible application of this result to
the information loss puzzle is briefly discussed.

there coexist mutually opposite two statistics in the AMD framework: One is the
classical statistics of the motion of wave packet centroids and the other is
the quantum statistics of the motion of wave packets which is described by the
AMD wave function. We prove the classical statistics of wave packet centroids
by using the framework of the microcanonical ensemble of the nuclear system. We
show that the quantum statistics of wave packets emerges from the classical
statistics of wave packet centroids. It is emphasized that the temperature of
the classical statistics of wave packet centroids is different from the
temperature of the quantum statistics of wave packets. We then explain that the
statistical properties of AMD for nucleon emission processes are classical
because nucleon emission processes in AMD are described by the motion of wave
packet centroids. When we improve the description of the nucleon emission
process so as to take into account the momentum fluctuation due to the wave
packet spread, the AMD statistical properties for nucleon emission processes
change drastically into quantum statistics. Our study of nucleon emission
processes can be conversely regarded as giving another kind of proof of the
fact that the statistics of wave packets is quantum mechanical while that of
wave packet centroids is classical.
