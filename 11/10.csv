discussing current topics in the study of HB stellar evolution, including a
brief review of the main determinants of the structure of low-mass core helium
burning stars and of HB morphology. I describe the `first' and `second'
parameter effects on HB morphology, and attempt to summarize the current state
of affairs and how future investigations might improve our findings in this
area. I also briefly discuss the topic that has generated the most theoretical
attention over the last 5 years, that of the hot end of HB sequences. I then
discuss the current state of HB theory, reviewing the effect of new physics on
the models, and the special considerations (partial mixing) that arise in core
helium burning models. Finally, I discuss two other outstanding issues. After
noting that the mass loss mechanism is not at all understood, I review detailed
work by several different groups concerning the age, abundance spread, and
rotational properties of RGB and HB stars in the `second parameter' clusters M3
and M13. I conclude by discussing the HB luminosity-metallicity relation. The
discrepancy between the slope of this relation from different lines of argument
appears largely to have been resolved. However, the observational data and
theoretical sequences (if Y ~ 0.23) are still in conflict as far as the HB
luminosity zero-point is concerned.

about 10% of a claimed supercluster of QSO absorption-lines at z=2.38 (Francis

emitting galaxies. The discovery of two such galaxies in our tiny field
supports Francis & Hewett's interpretation of the absorption-line supercluster
as a high redshift ""Great Wall"".
  One of the Ly-alpha galaxies lies 22 arcsec from a background QSO, and may be
associated with a multi-component Ly-alpha absorption complex seen in the QSO
spectrum. This galaxy has an extended (50kpc) lumpy Ly-alpha morphology,
surrounding a compact IR-bright nucleus. The nucleus shows a pronounced break
in its optical-UV colors at about 4000 A (rest-frame), consistent with a
stellar population of mass about 7E11 solar masses, an age of more than 500
Myr, and little on-going star-formation. C IV emission is detected, suggesting
that a concealed AGN is present. Extended H-alpha emission is also detected;
the ratio of Ly-alpha flux to H-alpha is abnormally low (about 0.7), probable
evidence for extended dust.
  This galaxy is surrounded by a number of very red (B-K>5) objects, some of
which have colors suggesting that they too are at z=2.38. We hypothesize that
this galaxy, its neighbors and a surrounding lumpy gas cloud may be a giant
elliptical galaxy in the act of bottom-up formation.

inspiraling binaries must be aided by signal processing methods, and that the
technique of matched filtering is the most likely to be used for the detection
of inspiral ``chirps''. This means that the output of an interferometer must be
cross- correlated with many waveform templates to dig out faint signals buried
in the noise. The templates are characterized by several parameters which vary
continuously over some finite range; but because the amount of computing power
available to perform the cross-correlations of the search templates with the
output is finite, the actual templates used must be picked with certain
discrete values of these parameters, which will have some finite spacing. If
the spacing is too small, the number of templates (and therefore the computing
power) needed to perform an on-line search becomes prohibitive; if the spacing
is too large, many chirps will not be detected because the values of their
parameters lie too far from those of the nearest template. In this paper I use
differential geometry to extend the earlier formalism of Sathyaprakash and
Dhurandhar to estimate the template spacing, number of templates, and computing
power required for a single-pass, on-line search of the output of a single
interferometer in terms of the fraction of events lost to parameter
discretization. My formalism obtains these results with little numerical
computation, and is valid for arbitrary noise spectra and template
parameterizations. I find that the computing power needed for the most
computationally intensive, reasonable search is of order several hundred
Gigaflops. This will be feasible by the time LIGO is operational, but it is
worth pursuing methods of reducing this number.

hole is considered. If a part of an infinitely long string passes close to a
black hole it can be captured. The final stationary configurations of such
captured strings are investigated. A uniqueness theorem is proved, namely it is
shown that the minimal 2-D surface $\Sigma$ describing a captured stationary
string coincides with a {\it principal Killing surface}, i.e. a surface formed
by Killing trajectories passing through a principal null ray of the Kerr-Newman
geometry. Geometrical properties of principal Killing surfaces are investigated
and it is shown that the internal geometry of $\Sigma$ coincides with the
geometry of a 2-D black or white hole ({\it string hole}). The equations for
propagation of string perturbations are shown to be identical with the
equations for a coupled pair of scalar fields 'living' in the spacetime of a
2-D string hole. Some interesting features of physics of 2-D string holes are
described. In particular, it is shown that the existence of the extra
dimensions of the surrounding spacetime makes interaction possible between the
interior and exterior of a string black hole; from the point of view of the 2-D
geometry this interaction is acausal. Possible application of this result to
the information loss puzzle is briefly discussed.

the quantum model is elucidated through the analysis of the canonical structure

$P,T-$invariant planar massive fermion model and the proposed pseudoclassical
model --- for a particular choice of the parameter appearing in the Lagrangian

hidden supersymmetry leads to a non-standard superextension of the
(2+1)-dimensional Poincar\'e group. In the quantum theory the one particle
states provide an irreducible representation of the extended supergroup
labelled by the zero eigenvalue of the superspin. We discuss the gauge
modification of the pseudoclassical model and compare our results with those
obtained from the standard pseudoclassical model for massive planar fermions.

minimum size of such a covering is denoted by C(v,k,t). It is easy to see that

two of those constructions are asymptotically optimal: For fixed k and t, the

within the molecular-field approximation. The numerical results show that for
dipole-dipole interaction only, all long periodic linear chain phases are
suppressed to low temperatures. However, when the long-range indirect
interaction becomes important, the long-periodic linear chain phases start to
fill up the phase diagram and develop a high thermal stability. Model
parameters are chosen to reconstruct a sequence of long-periodic phases as
observed experimentally for Li/Mo(112) and Li/W(112).

Finite-difference equations are viewed as a system of algebraic equations with

derivatives. It is shown that application of the approximate invariance
criterion to this algebraic system results in relations that can be viewed as
prolongation formulae and the invariance criterion for the differential
approximation of these finite-difference equations. This allows us to study the
group properties of the finite-difference equations by analyzing the group
properties of their differential approximations, which are the differential
equations with a small parameter. In particular, the question of whether the
group, admitted by the original differential equation, can be corrected by
adding the first-order perturbation to it, so that the resulting group with a
small parameter is approximately admitted by the finite-difference
approximation, is studied. It is shown by examples that, for a given
