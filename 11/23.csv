stellar mass loss occurring in the outer parts of the central galaxy. This may
give rise to a substantial metallicity enhancement towards the center, whose
amplitude is proportional to the ratio of the central galaxy luminosity to the
mass inflow rate. The metallicity of the hotter phases is expected to be higher
than that of the colder, denser phases. The metallicity profile expected for
the Centaurus cluster is in good agreement with the iron abundance gradient
recently inferred from ASCA measurements (Fukazawa et al. 1994). However,
current data do not rule out alternative models where cooling is balanced by
some heat source. In either case, the enhancement expected from injection by

show that such planets are stable and estimate the magnitude of classical Jeans
evaporation and of photodissociation and loss due to EUV radiation. Even over
the lifetime of the primary, the present companion would not have lost a large

proton direction. The data are compared with results from experiments at lower
beam energies, with the naive quark parton model and with parton models
including perturbative QCD corrections. The comparison shows the importance of
the higher order QCD processes. Significant differences of the inclusive
charged particle rates between NRG and LRG events at the same $W$ are observed.
The value of $<\!\!p_t^{*\,2}\!\!>\,\,$ for LRG events with a hadronic mass
$M_X$, which excludes the forward produced baryonic system, is similar to the

holonomy, whereas $N=0$ for the right-squashed $S^7$. All these solutions
saturate the same Bogomol'nyi bound between the mass and charge. Similar

combinatorics of these elements allows one to compute irreducible
representations explicitly and often very easily. In this paper we do these
computations for Weyl groups and Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types $A_n$, $B_n$,
$D_n$, $G_2$. Although these computations are in reach for types $F_4$, $E_6$,
and $E_7$, we shall, in view of the length of the current paper, postpone this
to another work.

the correlated motion of particle-hole pairs is studied, starting from the
general two-particle Greens function. In this way we derive a matrix equation
for eigenvalues and wave functions, respectively, of the general type of
collective excitation of a N-particle system. The interplay between excitons
and plasmons is fully described by this new set of equations. As a by-product
we obtain - at least a-posteriori - a justification for the use of the TDLDA
for simple-metal clusters.

perturbation theory, the role of self-interaction errors inherent to the Local
Density Approximation (LDA) to Density Functional Theory is estimated in the
determination of ground state and low energy isomeric structures of small
metallic clusters. Its application to neutral sodium clusters with 8 and 20
atoms shows that the SIC provides sizeable effects in Na_8, leading to a
different ordering of the low lying isomeric states compared with ab-initio LDA
predictions, whereas for Na_20, the SIC effects are less pronounced, such that
a quantitative agreement is achieved between the present method and ab-initio
LDA calculations.

dimensions. This equation contains a friction-like term which can be switched
off by annihilating a free parameter $\ep$. We apply the prolongation method,
the symmetry and the approximate symmetry approach. This strategy allows us to
get insight into both the equations for $\ep =0$ and $\ep \ne 0$, whose
properties arising in the above frameworks are mutually compared. For $\ep =0$,
the related prolongation equations are solved by means of certain series
expansions which lead to an infinite- dimensional Lie algebra. Furthermore,
using a realization of the Lie algebra of the Euclidean group $E_{2}$, a
connection is shown between the continuous Toda equation and a linear wave
equation which resembles a special case of a three-dimensional wave equation
that occurs in a generalized Gibbons-Hawking ansatz \cite{lebrun}. Nontrivial
solutions to the wave equation expressed in terms of Bessel functions are
determined.
  For $\ep\,\ne\,0,$ we obtain a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with four
elements. A matrix representation of this algebra yields solutions of the
modified continuous Toda equation associated with a reduced form of a
perturbative Liouville equation. This result coincides with that achieved in
the context of the approximate symmetry approach. Example of exact solutions
are also provided. In particular, the inverse of the exponential-integral
function turns out to be defined by the reduced differential equation coming
from a linear combination of the time and space translations. Finally, a Lie
algebra characterizing the approximate symmetries is discussed.
