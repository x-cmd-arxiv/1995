and K'. We also present a K' image of M51 (NGC 5194) for comparison. Fourier
decomposition of the disk light reveals that the radial distribution of power
depends on wavelength, which in turn implies that the spiral structure traced
in the visual (i.e. young population I and dust) is different from the one
detected at 2 microns (i.e. old stellar disk). We observe radial modulation of
the power and a dependency of power with wavelength that are consistent with
modal theory of spiral structure.
  A central motivation for our research is the fundamental idea of density wave
theory that the passage of a spiral density wave triggers star formation. We
have found a stellar population age gradient consistent with this scenario in a
reddening-free, red supergiant-sensitive, Q-like photometric parameter at 6 kpc
galactocentric distance across one of the arms of M99. We rule out that the
change in this parameter, Q(r_SJgi), across the arm is mainly due to dust. The
difference in Q(r_SJgi) going from the interarm regions to the arms also
indicates that arms cannot be due exclusively to crowding of stellar orbits.
  We present the first measurement of Omega_p, the angular speed of the spiral
pattern, and of the location of the corotation radius, derived from the drift
velocity of the young stars away from their birth site. The measured Q(r_SJgi)
implies a star formation rate for M99 within the range of 10-20 M_odot/yr; a
disk stellar mass surface density of ~80 M_odot/pc^2; and a maximum
contribution of ~20 percent from red supergiants to the K' light in a small
region, and much smaller on average. We measure a K' arm--interarm contrast of
2-3, too high for M99 to be a truly isolated galaxy.

that (with minor exceptions) any nontrivial Lorentzian cobordism necessarily
possesses. In two dimensions any cobordism can be built up as a combination of
only two elementary types, the ``yarmulke'' and the ``trousers.'' For each of
these elementary cobordisms, we consider a family of Morse-theory inspired
Lorentzian metrics that vanish smoothly at a single point, resulting in a
conical-type singularity there. In the yarmulke case, the distinguished point
is analogous to a cosmological initial (or final) singularity, with the
spacetime as a whole being obtained from one causal region of Misner space by
adjoining a single point. In the trousers case, the distinguished point is a
``crotch singularity'' that signals a change in the spacetime topology (this
being also the fundamental vertex of string theory, if one makes that
interpretation). We regularize the metrics by adding a small imaginary part
whose sign is fixed to be positive by the condition that it lead to a
convergent scalar field path integral on the regularized spacetime. As the
regulator is removed, the scalar density $1/2 \sqrt{-g} R$ approaches a
delta-function whose strength is complex: for the yarmulke family the strength
is $\beta -2\pi i$, where $\beta$ is the rapidity parameter of the associated
Misner space; for the trousers family it is simply $+2\pi i$. This implies that
in the path integral over spacetime metrics for Einstein gravity in three or
more spacetime dimensions, topology change via a crotch singularity is
exponentially suppressed, whereas appearance or disappearance of a universe via
a yarmulke singularity is exponentially enhanced.

quark-gluon plasma in thermal equilibrium through diagrammatic analyses of the
statistical average, $\langle \Theta_{\mu \nu} \rangle$, of the
energy-momentum-tensor operator $\Theta_{\mu \nu}$. To leading order at high
temperature, the energy density of the long wave length modes is consistently
extracted by applying the hard-thermal-loop resummation scheme to the
operator-inserted no-leg thermal amplitudes $\langle \Theta_{\mu \nu} \rangle$.
We find that, for the long wave length gluons, the energy density, being
positive, is tremendously enhanced as compared to the noninteracting case,
while, for the quarks, no noticeable deviation from the noninteracting case is
found.

In addition, they depend on the constituent quark mass $M$, a parameter
characteristic of the model. The $\gamma_5$-scheme dependence of the chiral
coefficients, computed via dimensional regularization, and the Fierz
transformation properties of the operator basis are discussed in detail. We
apply our result to the evaluation of the hadronic matrix elements for the
decay $K^0 \rightarrow 2 \pi$, consistently including the renormalization
induced by the meson loops. The effect of this renormalization is sizable and
introduces a long-distance scale dependence that matches in the physical
amplitudes the short-distance scale dependence of the Wilson coefficients.

weak gauge bosons makes the mixing possible at two-loop level. Nowhere the

100-600 GeV, the $\eta \ra \pi +\pi $ branching ratio is found to be $3\cdot
10^{-26} - 2\cdot 10^{-29}$, hence unconventional CP violation mechanisms are

of a real vector superfield to describe composite gauge invariant degrees of

formulation using a chiral superfield is demonstrated. These results strongly
suggest that chiral-linear duality survives nonperturbative effects in
superstrings.

provide topological solutions for $N=2$ supergravity with a vanishing

the symmetry under diffeomorphisms and right-supersymmetry transformations.
