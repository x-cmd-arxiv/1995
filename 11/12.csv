  anand@iucaa.ernet.in. (MNRAS in press)",,"10.1093/mnras/280.3.767",,"astro-ph",,"  We have compiled, from the literature, a sample of Ly ${\alpha}$ forest lines
in the spectra of 69 QSOs, all observed with a resolution between 60 to 100 km
s$^{-1}$. The sample is studied for proximity effect. We have tried to account
for the effect of blending which is inherent in the intermediate resolution
sample, by calculating the column density distribution, using an effective
velocity dispersion parameter, from the observed equivalent width distribution.
The use of this column density distribution in the proximity effect analysis
reduces the background intensity values by a factor of 2 to 3 compared to the
values obtained by using the column density distribution obtained from high
resolution observations. Evidence is presented for a weak correlation between
the effective velocity dispersion parameter and equivalent width. Such a
correlation if present can increase the background values by a factor of up to
1.5. Considerations of proximity in the spectra of 16 QSOs, from our sample,
exhibiting damped Ly ${\alpha}$ lines gives a background intensity which is 3
times smaller than the values obtained from the whole sample, confirming the
presence of dust in the damped Ly $\alpha$ systems. Lines close to the QSOs are
shown to be marginally stronger and broader compared to lines away from the
QSOs. The Ly $\alpha$ lines with absorption redshift larger than emission
redshift are shown to be uncorrelated with QSO luminosity, radio loudness or
optical spectral index. These lines occur more frequently at high redshifts.
Their presence is correlated weakly with the presence of associated metal line
systems. The possibilities that the QSO emission redshift is considerably
higher and that either the Ly $\alpha$ clouds or the QSOs have peculiar
velocities are considered. It is argued that a combination of both these

different directions in the Galaxy, as part of an investigation of galactic
structure and evolution. Three fields in the direction of galactic anticentre,
centre and antirotation have been surveyed. Using our new data together with
wide-area surveys in other fields available to date, we discuss the radial and
vertical structure of the Galaxy. The density laws for stars with M$_{V}\ge$3.5
follow a sum of two exponentials with scale heights of 260$\pm$50 pc (thin
disk) and 760$\pm$50 pc, respectively. This second exponential corresponds to a
thick disk with a local density of 7.4$^{+2.5}_{-1.5}$ \% relative to the thin
disk. The scale lengths for these two populations are respectively 2.3$\pm$0.6
kpc and 3$\pm$1 kpc. The thick disk appears as a kinematically distinct
population from the thin disk and shows no vertical gradient. Of the many
models that have been proposed for the origin of the thick disk, the evidence
at present seems to favour a model in which thick disk formed through the rapid
dynamical heating of an early disk by satellite accretion into the disk.

experiments. In particular, we study the thermodynamics of a string network
within a toroidal universe, as a function of string energy density and space
dimensionality. We find that when the energy density of the system is low, the
dominant part of the string is in the form of closed loops of the shortest
allowed size, which correspond to the momentum string modes. At a certain
critical energy density corresponding to the Hagedorn temperature, the system
undergoes a phase transition characterized by the formation of very long loops,
winding a number of times around the torus. These loops correspond to the
winding string modes. As the energy density is increased, all the extra energy
goes into these long strings. We then study the lifetime of winding modes as a
function of the space densionality. We find that in the low--energy density
regime, long winding strings decay only if the space dimensionality of the
toroidal universe is equal to 3. This finding supports the proposed
cosmological scenario by Brandenberger and Vafa, which attempts to explain the
space dimensionality and to avoid the initial singularity by means of string
theory.
