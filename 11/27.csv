  June 1995",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We study the accumulation of errors in cosmological N-body algorithms that
are caused by representing the continuous distribution of matter by massive
particles, comparing the PPPM and Adaptive Multigrid codes. We use for this a
new measure of two-body relaxation suitable for nonstationary gravitating
systems. This measure is based on accumulated deflection angles of particle
orbits and it does not saturate during evolution. We have found that the role
of gravitational collisions in standard PPPM-models is rather high, and in
order to avoid collision effects we recommend to use large comoving softening
parameters epsilon>=1.0 (in grid units).

solver for n-body simulations that minimizes relaxation caused by small
particle number fluctuations. With the standard algorithm, the noise leading to
relaxation can be reduced by making the expansion basis similar to the particle
distribution and by carefully choosing the maximum order in the expansion. The
proposed algorithm accomplishes both tasks simultaneously while the simulation
is running. This procedure is asymptotically equivalent to expanding in an
orthogonal series which is matched to the distribution to start and truncating
at low order. Because the modified algorithm adapts to a time-evolving
distribution, it has advantage over a fixed basis.
  The required changes to the standard algorithm are minor and do not affect
its overall structure or scalability. Tests show that the overhead in CPU time
is small in practical applications. The decrease in relaxation rate is
demonstrated for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric systems and the
robustness of the algorithm is demonstrated by following the evolution of
unstable generalized polytropes. Finally, the empirically based moment analysis
which leads to the uncorrelated basis is an ideal tool for investigating
structure and modes in n-body simulations and an example is provided.

consistent with no-evolution predictions based on conventional flat Schechter
luminosity functions (LF's) and a standard cosmology.
  Conversely, late-type/Irregulars show a steeply rising differential number
count with slope $(\frac{\delta log N}{\delta m}) = 0.64\pm 0.1$. No-evolution
models based on the Loveday et al. (1992) and Marzke et al. (1994b) {\it local}
luminosity functions under-predict the late-type/Irregular counts by 1.0 and
0.5 dex, respectively, at I = 21.75 mag. Examination of the Irregulars alone
shows that $\sim 50$% appear inert and the remainder have multiple cores. If
the inert galaxies represent a non-evolving late-type population, then a
Loveday-like LF ($\alpha\simeq -1.0$) is ruled out for these types, and a LF
with a steep faint-end ($\alpha\simeq -1.5$) is suggested. If multiple core
structure indicates recent star-formation, then the observed excess of faint
blue field galaxies is likely due to {\it evolutionary} processes acting on a
{\it steep} field LF for late-type/Irregulars. The evolutionary mechanism is
unclear, but 60% of the multiple-core Irregulars show close companions. To
reconcile a Marzke-like LF with the faint redshift surveys, this evolution must
be preferentially occurring in the brightest late-type galaxies with z > 0.5 at

synthesized stellar spectrum constructed from reference stars of spectral type

the active-chromosphere contribution to the Ca~{\sc ii} H \& K lines in these
73 systems. We have determined the excess Ca~{\sc ii} H \& K emission
equivalent widths and converted them into surface fluxes. The emissions arising
from each component were obtained when it was possible to deblend both
contributions. We have found that the components of active binaries are
generally stronger emitters than single active stars for a given effective
temperature and rotation rate. A slight decline of the excess Ca~{\sc ii} H \&
K emissions towards longer rotation periods, P$_{\rm rot}$, and larger Rossby
numbers, R$_{0}$, is found. When we use R$_{0}$ instead of P$_{\rm rot}$ the
scatter is reduced and a saturation at R$_{0}$ $\approx$~0.3 is observed. A
good correlation between the excess Ca~{\sc ii}~K and H$\epsilon$ chromospheric
emission fluxes has been found. The correlations obtained between the excess
Ca~{\sc ii}~K emission and other activity indicators, (C~{\sc iv} in the

Sixteen targets were detected in HI; 18 previously uncataloged objects were
discovered directly in HI. The control sample consists of 12 cubes centered on
IRAS selected galaxies with FIR luminosities similar to those of the Bootes
targets and located in regions of 1 to 2 times the cosmic mean density. In
addition to the 12 targets 29 companions were detected in HI. We find that the
number of galaxies within 1 Mpc of the targets is the same to within a factor
of two for void and control samples, and thus that the small scale clustering
of galaxies is the same in regions that differ by a factor of $\sim$ 6 in
density on larger scales. A dynamical analysis of the galaxies in the void
suggests that on scales of a few Mpc the galaxies are gravitationally bound,
forming interacting galaxy pairs, loose pairs and loose groups. One group is
compact enough to qualify as a Hickson compact group. The galaxies found in the
void are mostly late-type, gas rich systems. A careful scrutiny of their HI and
optical properties shows them to be very similar to field galaxies of the same
morphological type. This, combined with our finding that the small scale
clustering of the galaxies in the void is the same as in the field, suggests
that it is the near environment that mostly affects the evolution of galaxies.

spontaneous breaking scale light and strange baryons should be considered as
systems of three constituent quarks with an effective confining interaction and
a chiral interaction that is mediated by the octet of Goldstone bosons
(pseudoscalar mesons) between the constituent quarks.

standard many-body techniques which render the approximations amenable to
systematic improvement. Using BCS variational methods, dynamic chiral symmetry
breaking naturally emerges and both quarks and gluons acquire constituent
masses. Gluonia are studied both in the valence and in the collective, random
phase approximations. Using representative values for the strong coupling
constant and string tension, calculated quenched glueball masses are found to
be in remarkable agreement with lattice gauge theory.

topological model, which is isomorphic to a tensor product of two topological
ghost systems independent of each other. One of them is identified with $c=1$
bosonic string theory while the other has trivial physical contents. This fact
enables us to regard two-dimensional fermionic string theory as an embedding of
$c=1$ bosonic string theory in the moduli space of fermionic string theories.
Upon this embedding, the discrete states of $c=1$ string theory are mapped to
those of fermionic string theory, which is considered to be the origin of the
similarity between the physical spectra of these two theories. We also discuss
a novel BRST operator associated with this topological structure.

curved space time, was believed to be non-unitary in the algebraic treatment
involving affine current algebra. It is shown that this was an error that
resulted from neglecting a zero mode that must be included to describe the
correct physics of non-compact WZW models. In the presence of the zero mode the
mass-shell condition is altered and unitarity is restored. The correct
currents, including the zero mode, have logarithmic cuts on the worldsheet.
This has physical consequences for the spectrum because a combination of zero
modes must be quantized in order to impose periodic boundary conditions on mass
shell in the physical sector. To arrive at these results and to solve the model
completely, the SL(2,R) WZW model is quantized in a free field formalism that
differs from previous ones in that the fields and the currents are Hermitean,
there are cuts, and there is a new term that could be present more generally,
but is excluded in the WZW model.

Real-Space Renormalization Group method and Quantum Groups. We show this
relation by applying real-space RG methods to study two quantum group invariant
Hamiltonians, that of the XXZ model and the Ising model in a transverse field
(ITF) defined in an open chain with appropriate boundary terms. The quantum
group symmetry is preserved under the RG transformation except for the
appearence of a quantum group anomalous term which vanishes in the classical
case. This is called {\em the quantum group anomaly}. We derive the new qRG
equations for the XXZ model and show that the RG-flow diagram obtained in this
fashion exhibits the correct line of critical points that the exact model has.
In the ITF model the qRG-flow equations coincide with the tensor product
decomposition of cyclic irreps of $SU_q(2)$ with $q^4=1$.

classical counterparts. We show, using the formalism of quantum phase-space
distributions, that our formation method, which is equivalent to Weyl's rule,
gives the correct answer. Since this method implies that eigenstates are not
dispersion-free we argue for modifications in the orthodox view. Many
properties of the quantum phase-space distributions are also investigated and
discussed in the realm of our classical approach. We then strengthen the
conclusions of our previous papers that quantum mechanics is merely an
extremely good approximation of classical statistical mechanics performed upon
the configuration space.
