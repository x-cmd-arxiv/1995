power spectrum of the cosmic microwave anisotropy depends on the fundamental
nature of the perturbations which produced them. The formalism of Hu and
Sugiyama is extended to treat models with cosmic defects. We discuss how
perturbations can be ``active'' or ``passive'' and ``incoherent'' or
``coherent'', and show how causality and scale invariance play rather different
roles in these various cases. We find that the existence of secondary Doppler
peaks and the rough placing of the primary peak unambiguously reflect these
basic properties.

  accepted by A&A main journal",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We have searched for periodicity in the photometric and spectroscopic
variations of the enigmatic star HD 101584 and found a long-term variability on
a typical time scale of 1700 days (4.7 years) and a highly significant period
of 218+-0.7 day. This period is most prominently present in the photometric
indices which are a measure for the Balmer jump (Geneva d and Stromgren c). The
Doppler velocities of the high-excitation photospheric absorption lines (HeI
and CII) seem to be variable with the photometric period. Our data favor the
218 day period for the Doppler velocities with a small probability that the
true period is 436 days. We argue that HD 101584 is a close (highly) eccentric
218 day binary system with a low-mass unseen secondary. The photometric and
Doppler variations are attributed to changes in the velocity law and mass-loss
rate of the stellar wind which lead to asymmetric line profiles and a phase
dependent Balmer discontinuity. Binary interaction is responsible for the
changes in velocity law and mass-loss rate leading to the observed phenomena.

supernovae and stellar mass loss in the outer parts of the central galaxy,
which may give rise to a substantial metallicity gradient. The amplitude of the
expected metallicity enhancement towards the cluster center is proportional to
the ratio of the central galaxy luminosity to the mass inflow rate. The
metallicity of the hotter phases is expected to be higher than that of the
colder, denser phases. The metallicity profile expected for the Centaurus
cluster is in good agreement with the metallicity gradient recently inferred
from ASCA measurements (Fukazawa et al. 1994). However, current data do not
rule out alternative models where cooling is balanced by some heat source. The
metallicity gradient does not need to be present in all clusters, depending on
the recent merging history of the gas around the central cluster galaxy, and on
the ratio of the stellar mass in the central galaxy to the gas mass in the
cooling flow.

terminates by the accretion shock in the vicinity of the white dwarf at the
distance of the order of the accretion radius. The gas inside the accretion
radius constitutes the main body of a target for gamma ray production by $pp$
collisions.\par The supernova explosion and the shock propagation in the white
dwarf result in the hydrodynamical acceleration of the outer layers of the
star. The spectrum of accelerated particles is steep and the maximum energy
does not exceed $1000$ $GeV$.\par The gamma ray burst is produced due to
interaction of the accelerated particles with the gas in the binary system.
Most of the photons have energies about $100$ $MeV$, the total number of the

have one or two precursors. The first one is produced during the shock breakout

for which the loop expansion predicts increased symmetry breaking at high
temperature. Even though this behavior would clearly have far reaching
implications for cosmology such theories have not been fully investigated in
the literature. This is at least partially due to the counter intuitive nature
of the result, which has led to speculations that it is merely an artifact of
perturbation theory. To address this issue we study the simplest model
displaying high temperature symmetry breaking using a Wilson renormalization
group approach. We find that although the critical temperature is not reliably
estimated by the loop expansion the total volume of parameter space which leads
to the inverse phase structure is not significantly different from the
perturbative prediction. We also investigate the temperature dependence of the
coupling constants and find that they run approximately according to their
one-loop $\beta$-functions at high temperature. Thus, in particular, the
quartic coupling of $phi^4$ theory is shown to increase with temperature, in
contrast to the behavior obtained in some previous studies.

baryon- baryon interaction is presented, both in the scalar-isoscalar
($\sigma$) and the vector-isovector ($\rho$) channel. The correlations between
the two pseudoscalar mesons are taken into account by means of $\pi\pi - K\bar
K$ amplitudes derived from a meson-exchange model, which is in line with the
empirical $\pi\pi$ data. It is found that correlated $K\bar K$ exchange plays
an important role in the $\sigma$-channel for baryon-baryon states with non-
vanishing strangeness. The strength of correlated $\pi\pi$ plus $K\bar K$
exchange in the $\sigma$-channel decreases with the strangeness of the baryon-
baryon system becoming more negative. The results for correlated $\pi\pi$-
exchange in the vector-isovector channel deviate from what is expected in the
naive SU(3) picture for genuine $\rho$-exchange. Shortcomings of a simplified
description in terms of sharp mass $\sigma$- and $\rho$-exchange are pointed
out.

  Collisionless Plasmas","7 pages LaTeX",,,,"plasm-ph physics.plasm-ph",,"  The theory of plasma waves and Landau damping in Maxwellian plasmas, Landau's
``rule of pass around poles'' include doubtful statements, particularly related
to an artificial ``constructing'' of the dispersion equation, what should allow
the possibility of its solution otherwise not existing at all, and the
possibility of analytical continuations of corresponding very specific ruptured
functions in the one-dimensional Laplace transformation, used by Landau, what
is the base of his theory.
  We represent, as an accessible variant, a more general alternative theory
based on a two-dimensional Laplace transformation, leading to an asymptotical
in time and space solution as a complicated superposition of coupled damping
and {\em non-damping \/} plane waves and oscillations with different dispersion
laws for every constituent mode. This theory naturally and very simply explains
paradoxes of the phenomenon of plasma echo. We propose for discussion a new
ideology of plasma waves (both electron and ion-acoustic waves) qualitatively
different from the traditional theory of Landau damping for non-collisional as
well as for low-collisional plasmas.
