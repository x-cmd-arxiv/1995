observed angular distribution is isotropic, while the brightness distribution
of bursts shows a reduced number of faint events. These observations favor a
cosmological burst origin. Alternatively, very extended Galactic Halo (EGH)
models have been considered. In the latter scenario, the currently favored
source of gamma-ray bursts involves high velocity pulsars ejected from the
Galactic disk. To be compatible with the observed isotropy, most models invoke
a sampling distance of 300 kpc, a turn-on delay of 30 Myrs, and a source life
time of about 1 Gyr. We consider the global energy requirements of such models
and show that the largest known resource. rotational kinetic energy, is
insufficient by orders of magnitude to provide the observed burst rate. More
exotic energy sources or differently tuned pulsar models may be able to get
around the global energy constraint but at the cost of becoming contrived.
Thus, while extended halo models are not ruled out, our arguments place a
severe obstacle for such models and we encourage proponents of EGH models to
clearly address the issue of global energetics.

recombination line (HRL) maser, in the millimeter and submillimeter spectrum of
the emission line star MWC349, requires an expansion of current paradigms about
HRLs. In this paper we re-examine in general the physics of non-LTE populations
in recombining hydrogen and specify the conditions necessary for high-gain
masing and lasing in HRLs.
  Saturation of masing recombination lines is a critical consideration.
  We draw attention to another non-LTE phenomenon active in hydrogen: the
overcooling} of populations. Observationally the HRL overcooling might manifest
itself as an anomalously weak emission recombination line, or as a ``dasar,''
that is, an anomalously strong absorption line.
  We briefly discuss the prospects of detecting hydrogen masers, lasers and
dasars in several classes of galactic and extragalactic objects, including
compact HII regions, Be or Wolf-Rayet stars, and AGNs.

double-well oscillator model. Here it arises from a doubling of the number of
effectively classical degrees of freedom, which are nonlinearly coupled in a
Gaussian variational approximation (TDHF) to full quantum mechanics. The
resulting first-order nondissipative autonomous flow system shows energy
dependent transitions between regular behavior and semiquantum chaos, which we
monitor by Poincar\'e sections and a suitable frequency correlation function
related to the density matrix. We discuss the general importance of this new
form of deterministic chaos and point out the necessity to study open
(dissipative) quantum systems, in order to observe it experimentally.

Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), containing two Higgs doublets and a
singlet, in the limit $\tan\beta \simeq m_t/m_b$. This is compared with the
corresponding particle spectrum of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM). In this limit the singlet vacuum expectation value is forced to be
large, of the order of $10$ TeV, and the singlet decouples from the lightest
scalar Higgs boson and the neutralinos. With the exception of the lightest
Higgs boson, the particle spectrum in the model turns out to be heavy. The
radiatively corrected lightest Higgs boson mass is in the neighbourhood of
$\sim 130$ GeV.
