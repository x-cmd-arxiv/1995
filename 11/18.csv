compiled by SS92. The conditions on cloud parameters to produce N(Fe II)>N(Mg
II) are obtained using photoionization models and curve of growth. Properties
of Mg II absorbers with W(Fe II)/W(MgII) (definded as R) >and< 0.5 are analysed
separately. Contrary to the whole Mg II sample, the clouds with R<0.5 show a
steep increase in number density (N(z)) with z. These systems also show clear
increase in W(Mg II) and doublet ratio(dr) of Mg II with z. However there is no
correlation between W(Mg II) and dr. In the case of R>0.5 clouds W(Mg II) and
dr are not correlated with z. However there is a clear anticorrelation between
dr and W(Mg II). We find a clear decrease in the ratio of W(Fe II) and W(Mg II)
with z. The N(z) as well as average N(Fe II) of Fe II lines selected absorbers
are not evolving with z. The available data of LLS, are not showing any
dependence of (tau_{LLS}) on z. We collected the LLS information for 53 QSO
sight lines, for which details of Mg II absorption are available. There are 4
Mg II absorption systems which are not LLS at z which are lower than the mean z
of the sample (z=1.1). In the higher z, where one expect to see 2.5\pm1.4 such
absorbers, we do not find any nonLLS Mg II absorbers. Individual systems with
tau_{LLS}<3.0 are analysed. Our results imply some of the absorbers at z=0.6
have reached metallicity roughly around solar value. The required ionization
parameters for these systems are less than 0.001 in most cases. Our results
together with results obtained for high z absorbers confirm that mean
ionization state of metal rich absorbing clouds falls with z.

on single particle decay which is seen to be valid only in the linear regime of
coherent oscillations of the scalar field. A new non-perturbative mechanism of
induced amplification of quantum fluctuations is introduced and studied in
detail, both analytically and numerically. This is a non-linear mechanism that
is typically a far more efficient way of transfering energy out of the zero

mathematical objects are specified. Some curious combinatorial aspects of
representation theory of isotopic pairs (graph-representations) are explicated.
Perspectives of the further researches are drawn.

asymptotic equipartition property. Our proof relies on using local measurements
on the quantum source to obtain an associated classical source. The classical
source provides an upper bound for the dimension of the relevant subspace of
the quantum source, via the Shannon-McMillan noiseless coding theorem. Along
the way we derive a bound for the von Neumann entropy of the quantum source in
terms of the Shannon entropy of the classical source, and we provide a
definition of ergodicity of the quantum source. Several explicit models of
quantum sources are also presented.

  Curvature and Torsion",,"in Proceedings of the XXV International Symposium Ahrenshoop on
  Theory of Elementary Particles in Gosen/Germany 1991, ed. by H. J. Kaiser",,,"quant-ph",,"  We formulate a new quantum equivalence principle by which a path integral for
a particle in a general metric-affine space is obtained from that in a flat
space by a non-holonomic coordinate transformation. The new path integral is
free of the ambiguities of earlier proposals and the ensuing Schr\""odinger
equation does not contain the often-found but physically false terms
proportional to the scalar curvature. There is no more quantum ordering
problem. For a particle on the surface of a sphere in $D$ dimensions, the new
path integral gives the correct energy $\propto \hat L^2$ where $\hat L$ are
the generators of the rotation group in ${\bf x}$-space. For the transformation
of the Coulomb path integral to a harmonic oscillator, which passes at an
intermediate stage a space with torsion, the new path integral renders the
correct energy spectrum with no unwanted time-slicing corrections.
