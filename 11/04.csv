models are presented, which have densities that vary as 1/r^gamma near the

each of two triaxial models with gamma=1 (weak cusp) and gamma=2 (strong cusp);
these two models have density profiles similar to those of the core and
power-law galaxies observed by HST. Both mass models have short-to-long axis
ratios of 1:2 and are maximally triaxial. A large fraction of the orbits in
both model potentials are stochastic, as evidenced by their non-zero Liapunov
exponents. We show that most of the stochastic orbits in the strong- cusp
potential diffuse relatively quickly through their allowed phase-space volumes,
on time scales of 100 - 1000 dynamical times. Stochastic orbits in the
weak-cusp potential diffuse more slowly, often retaining their box-like shapes
for 1000 dynamical times or longer. Attempts to construct self- consistent
solutions using just the regular orbits failed for both mass models.
Quasi-equilibrium solutions that include the stochastic orbits exist for both
models; however, real galaxies constructed in this way would evolve near the
center due to the continued mixing of the stochastic orbits. We attempted to
construct more nearly stationary models in which stochastic phase space was
uniformly populated at low energies. These ``fully mixed'' solutions were found
to exist only for the weak-cusp potential. No significant fraction of the mass
could be placed on fully-mixed stochastic orbits in the strong-cusp model,
demonstrating that strong triaxiality can be inconsistent with a high central
density.

synchrotron radiation at 77 and 95 keV. The use of high energy photons has
several advantages, in this case especially the large accessible momentum
transfer range, the low absorption and the direct comparability with neutron
diffraction. The range of momentum transfer covered is 0.6 \AA$^{-1} <$ Q
$<$24.0 \AA$^{-1}$. Neutron diffraction data on the same sample in the same
momentum transfer range have been published previously. In that study two
differently isotope - substituted species were investigated. In order to
compare neutron and photon diffraction data properly Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC-)
simulations have been performed. Some modifications had to be added to the
standard RMC- code introducing different constraints for inter- and
intramolecular distances as these distances partly overlap in liquid NMF. RMC-
simulations having only the neutron data as input were carried out in order to
test the quality of the X-ray data. The photon structure factor calculated from
the RMC- configurations is found to agree well with the present experimental
data, while it deviates considerably from earlier X-ray work using low energy
photons (17 keV). Finally we discuss whether the different interaction
mechanisms of neutrons and photons can be used to directly access the
electronic structure in the liquid. Evidence is presented that the elastic self
scattering part of liquid NMF is changed with respect to the independent atom
approximation. This modification can be accounted for by a simple charged atoms
model.

a torus contains short multiplets which are invariant under only one quarter of
the space-time supersymmetry generators. $U$-duality transformation converts
these states into bound states of Dirichlet branes which wrap around
intersecting cycles of the internal torus. We study a class of these bound
states that are dual to the elementary string states at the first excited
level, and argue that the degeneracy of these bound states is in agreement with
the $U$-duality prediction.

relevant to $P,T-$conserving models of high-$T_c$ superconductivity, has a
U(1,1) dynamical symmetry as well as an $N=3$ supersymmetry with the even
generator being a quadratic function of the spin operator and of the generator
of chiral ${\rm U_c(1)}$ transformations. We demonstrate that the hidden
supersymmetry leads to a non-standard superextension of the (2+1)-dimensional
Poincar\'e group. As a result, the one particle states of the $P,T-$invariant
fermion system realize an irreducible representation of the Poincar\'e
supergroup labelled by the zero eigenvalue of the superspin operator.

coupling constants of the classical models were obtained, small matrix elements

the effective coupling constants of the new Majoron models.
