the Galactic dark matter halo. It constrains the maximum black hole mass to
$\mbh \sil 5 \times 10^4 \msun$ by examining their influence on the population
of globular clusters in our Milky Way. In the adopted halo model, globular
clusters are exposed to constant bombardment of halo objects on their orbits
through the Galaxy and thus will steadily gain internal energy. Depending on
the mass of these halo objects and the structural parameters of the globular
clusters, they can be disrupted on time scales of a few billion years and
below. These disruption time scales are calculated using a modification of the
well known (classical) impulsive approximation and compared with direct N-body
simulations of such encounter events to ensure the method works correctly. For
a set of ten prototypical globular cluster models and black hole masses ranging
from $10^3$ to $10^7\:\msun$, Monte-Carlo-simulations of $10\,000$ encounter
histories over the period of 10 billion years were calculated each, at three
different galactocentric distances \mbox{$R = 5$}, $10$ and $15\, \kpc$. These

distort the shape of the ML light curve and shift the color of the observed

to observe this effect, but it should be detected with frequent and precise
followup observations. We calculate the expected rates for ML events where the
shape distortions will be observable by such followup observations, assuming
that the lenses are ordinary main-sequence stars in a bar and in the disk. We
study the dependence of the rates for color-shifted (CS) events on the
frequency of followup observations and on the precision of the photometry for a
variety of waveband pairings. We find that for hourly observations in $B$ and
$K$ with typical photometric errors of 0.01 mag, 28\% of the events where a
main-sequence bulge star is lensed, and 7\% of the events where the source is a
bulge giant, will give rise to a measurable CS at the 95\% confidence level.
For observations in $V$ and $I$, the fractions become 18\% and 5\%,
respectively, but may be increased to 40\% and 13\% by improved photometric
accuracy and increased sampling frequency. We outline how the mass, distance,
and transverse speed of the lens can be obtained, giving examples of typical
errors. We discuss how CS events can be distinguished from events where the
source is blended with a binary companion.

complement the previous $^{13}$CO, CS, and H$_2$CO measurements (Bally \etal
1988, Zylka \etal 1992) but cover a wider area with a better or comparable
resolution. The asymmetry in emission found in the $^{13}$CO observations by
Bally \etal (1988) is well confirmed in this study. Interestingly, the
asymmetry in HCN emission is more pronounced here: more than $80 \%$ of the
overall emission is found in the first quadrant ($l>0$) and $V_{LSR}>0$. Also
confirmed is the existence of several emission components in the regions
forbidden by the Galactic circular rotation. The HCN maps show clear absence of
both more outer galactic emissions and the 3 kpc arm component, which are both
visible in the $^{13}$CO map. This implies that the HCN emission lines are not
contaminated by foreground or background gas components. Therefore HCN data are
particularly useful in investigating the structures of molecular clouds in the
Galactic Center. The $\Delta V$s (FWHMs) of the most of the detected lines are
found to be very large, \ie, about $15\sim $55 km s$^{-1}$ with the mode at
$\Delta V \approx25$ km s$^{-1}$. The typical value of $\Delta V\approx 25$ km
s$^{-1}$ may imply that clouds with mass of an order of $10^6 \msun$ are common
in the GC region. Another trend found is that the maximum ${\Delta}V$ decreases
with $l$, which may be partly due to the overlapping effects of clouds.

came from events $q\bar{q}\gamma$ with two jets plus one photon. A comparison
of quark and gluon jet properties in different energy ranges was performed for
the first time and within the same detector. The average value of the ratio of
the mean charged multiplicities of gluon and quark jets was measured to be \[

increase of this ratio with energy was observed at a $3\sigma$ level. A further
dependence of this ratio related with the angular acceptance of the algorithm

local quark-hadron duality prescription is equivalent to using an effective $
\bar q q $ (two-body) light-cone wave function $\Psi^{(LD)}(x,k_{\perp})$ for
the pion. This wave function models soft dynamics of all higher $\bar qG \ldots
G q $ Fock components of the standard light-cone approach. Contributions
corresponding to higher Fock components in a hard regime appear in this
approach as radiative corrections and are suppressed by powers of
$\alpha_s/\pi$.

  After recalling the classical counting rules which describe the leading scale
dependence of form factors and elastic reactions at fixed angle, the
  pedagogical example of the pion form factor is developped in some detail in
order to show explicitely what factorization means in the QCD framework. The
inclusion of transverse degrees of freedom leads to the discussion of Sudakov
effects which are crucial for protecting the calculation from dangerous
infrared regions. The picture generalizes to many hard reactions; a strategy to
extract distribution amplitudes from future data is sketched. We discuss also
the particular case of hadron-hadron collisions where the independent
scattering mechanism dominates asymptotically and where a different
factorization formula applies. We briefly present the concepts of color
transparency and nuclear filtering and critically discuss the few present data
on this subject.

interpretation of certain types of transitions between different string vacua.
These transitions, discovered several years ago, involve singular conifold
configurations which connect distinct Calabi-Yau manifolds. In this paper we
discuss a number of aspects of conifold transitions pertinent to both
worldsheet and spacetime mirror symmetry. It is shown that the mirror transform
based on fractional transformations allows an extension of the mirror map to
conifold boundary points of the moduli space of weighted Calabi-Yau manifolds.
The conifold points encountered in the mirror context are not amenable to an
analysis via the original splitting constructions. We describe the first
examples of such nonsplitting conifold transitions, which turn out to connect
the known web of Calabi-Yau spaces to new regions of the collective moduli
space. We then generalize the splitting conifold transition to weighted
manifolds and describe a class of connections between the webs of ordinary and
weighted projective Calabi-Yau spaces. Combining these two constructions we
find evidence for a dual analog of conifold transitions in heterotic N$=$2
compactifications on K3$\times $T$^2$ and in particular describe the first
conifold transition of a Calabi-Yau manifold whose heterotic dual has been
identified by Kachru and Vafa. We furthermore present a special type of
conifold transition which, when applied to certain classes of Calabi-Yau K3
fibrations, preserves the fiber structure.

an understanding of the transformations only in the case where the metric on
the torus is endowed with Abelian Killing symmetries. Attempting to apply these
techniques to a general metric appears to yield a non-local world-sheet theory
that would defy interpretation in terms of space-time fields. However, there is
now available a simple but powerful general approach to understanding the
symmetry transformations of string theory, which are generated by certain
similarity transformations of the stress-tensors of the associated conformal
field theories. We apply this method to the particular case of T-Duality and i)
rederive the known transformations, ii) prove that the problem of non-locality
is illusory, iii) give an explicit example of the transformation of a metric

of representations of non-connected $p$-adic groups whose component group is
abelian. We define the notion of cuspidal parabolic for $G$ in order to give a
context for this discussion. Intertwining operators for the non-connected case
are examined and the notions of supercuspidal and discrete series are defined.
Finally, we examine parabolic induction from a cuspidal parabolic subgroup of
$G.$ Here we also develop a theory of $R$--groups, and show that these groups
parameterize the induced representations in a manner that is consistent with
the connected case and with the first set of results as well.
