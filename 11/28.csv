bias due to the inclination of spiral galaxies is more severe especially for
SNII in late spirals with only 1 SNe out of 5 being detected in edge--on

number counts are well described by {\it little or no}-evolution models, but
only when normalized at $b_{J} = 18.0$ mag. Given the uncertainties in the
luminosity function (LF) normalization, both populations are consistent with a
mild evolutionary scenario based on a normal/low rate of star-formation. This
constrains the end of the last {\it major} star-formation epoch in the giant
galaxy populations to $z\geq 0.8$.
  Conversely, the density of the observed late-type/Irregular population is
found to be a factor of 10 in excess of the conventional no-evolution model.
This large population might be explained by either a modified {\it local}
dwarf-rich LF, and/or strong evolution acting on the {\it local} LF. For the
dwarf-rich case, a {\it steep} faint-end Schechter-slope ($\alpha\simeq -1.8$)

anisotropic effective mass approximation within CuO$_2$ planes. The anisotropic
parameter $\lambda=m_x/m_y$, where $m_x$ ($m_y$) is the effective mass in the

shown that both the $s$- and $d$-wave components show a two-fold symmetry, in
contrast to the four-fold symmetry around the vortex, as expected for the

hence, are characterized by large variances of their amplitude. The statistical
properties of the anisotropies should reflect the underlying statistics of the

the temperature angular correlation function are described in detail. It is
shown that they are indeed large and must be present in the observational data,

the basic constituents of matter (in classical cosmology) and spacetime (in
quantum cosmology). Many newly developed concepts and techniques in condensed
matter physics stemming from the investigation of disordered, dynamical and
complex systems can guide us in asking the right questions and formulating new
solutions to existing and developing cosmological issues, thereby broadening
our view of the universe both in its formative and present state.

connection with particle physics, quantum gravity and unified theories. Answers
or hints to many fundamental questions in cosmology like the homogeneity and
isotropy of the Universe, the sources of structure formation and entropy
generation, and the initial state of the Universe can be traced back to the
activities of quantum fields and the dynamics of spacetime from the Grand
Unification time to the Planck time at $10^{-43} sec$. A closer depiction of
this primordial state of the Universe requires at least a semiclassical theory
of gravity and the consideration of non-equilibrium statistical processes
involving quantum fields. This critical state is intermediate between the
well-known classical epoch successfully described by Einstein's Theory of
General Relativity and the completely unknown realm of quantum gravity. Many
issues special to this stage such as the transition from quantum to classical
spacetime via decoherence, cross-over behavior at the Planck scale, tunneling
and particle creation, or growth of density contrast from vacuum fluctuations
share some basic concerns of mesoscopic physics for condensed matter, atoms or
nuclei, in the quantum/classical and the micro/macro interfaces, or the
discrete/continuum and the stochastic/ deterministic transitions. We point out
that underlying these issues are three main factors: quantum coherence,
fluctuations and correlation. We discuss how a deeper understanding of these
aspects of fields and spacetimes can help one to address some basic problems,
such as Planck scale metric fluctuations, cosmological phase transition and
structure formation, and the black hole entropy, end-state and information
paradox.

analysis of the softly broken finite supersymmetric grand unified theory. The
model, albeit non-minimal, remains very rigid due to the requirement of
finiteness. It is based on the $SU(5)$ gauge group and is UV finite to all
orders of perturbation theory. It contains three generations of the matter
fields together with four pairs of Higgses. The requirement of UV finiteness
fixes all the Yukawa couplings at the GUT scale. Imposing the condition of
universality on the soft couplings at the Planck scale and then extending the
condition of finiteness to them, one gets a completely finite unified theory
above $M_{GUT}.$ This makes the fine-tuning procedure more meaningful and leads
to the usual Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model below $M_{GUT}$. All the
masses of the ordinary particles including Higgses are obtained due to the
Higgs mechanism at the electro-weak scale. The hierarchy of quark and lepton
masses is related to that of v.e.v.'s of the Higgs fields and is governed by
the Higgs mixing matrix in the generation space. Superpartners develop their
masses according to the RG equations starting from the soft terms at the Planck
scale. The suggestion of complete finiteness and maximal simplicity of the
unified theory leads to the connection between the initial values of soft SUSY
breaking parameters, namely $m_0^2=1/3m_{1/2}^2,\ A_t=A_b=A_\tau=-m_{1/2}, \
B=-m_{1/2}$, so that the number of free parameters is less than that of the
MSSM.

spontaneously broken to a finite subgroup H. The spectrum consists of magnetic
vortices, global H charges and dyonic combinations exhibiting topological
Aharonov-Bohm interactions. Among other things, we review the Hopf algebra D(H)
related to this residual discrete H gauge theory, which provides an unified
description of the spin, braid and fusion properties of the aforementioned
particles. The implications of adding a Chern-Simons (CS) term to these models
are also addressed. We recall that the CS actions for a compact gauge group G
are classified by the cohomology group H^4(BG,Z). For finite groups H this
classification boils down to the cohomology group H^3(H,U(1)). Thus the
different CS actions for a finite group H are given by the inequivalent
3-cocycles of H. It is argued that adding a CS action for the broken gauge
group G leads to additional topological interactions for the vortices governed
by a 3-cocycle for the residual finite gauge group H determined by a natural
homomorphism from H^4(BG,Z) to H^3(H,U(1)). Accordingly, the related Hopf
algebra D(H) is deformed into a quasi-Hopf algebra. These general
considerations are illustrated by CS theories in which the direct product of
some U(1) gauge groups is broken to a finite subgroup H. It turns out that not
all conceivable 3-cocycles for finite abelian gauge groups H can be obtained in
this way. Those that are not reached are the most interesting. A Z_2 x Z_2 x
Z_2 CS theory given by such a 3-cocycle, for instance, is dual to an ordinary
gauge theory with nonabelian gauge group the dihedral group of order eight.
Finally, the CS theories with nonabelian finite gauge group a dihedral or
double dihedral group are also discussed in full detail.

independent of the choice of metric on ${\cal F}$ needed to define it. We also
overview how this definition can be adapted to the context of $3$-dimensional

D53 (1996) 5898-5905","10.1103/PhysRevD.53.5898","OKHEP-95-07","hep-th hep-lat",,"  Recently it was shown how to formulate the finite-element equations of motion
of a non-Abelian gauge theory, by gauging the free lattice difference
equations, and simultaneously determining the form of the gauge
transformations. In particular, the gauge-covariant field strength was
explicitly constructed, locally, in terms of a path ordered product of
exponentials (link operators). On the other hand, the Dirac and Yang-Mills
equations were nonlocal, involving sums over the entire prior lattice. Earlier,
Matsuyama had proposed a local Dirac equation constructed from just the
above-mentioned link operators. Here, we show how his scheme, which is closely
related to our earlier one, can be implemented for a non-Abelian gauge theory.
Although both Dirac and Yang-Mills equations are now local, the field strength
is not. The technique is illustrated with a direct calculation of the current
anomalies in two and four space-time dimensions. Unfortunately, unlike the
original finite-element proposal, this scheme is in general nonunitary.

pseudo Euclidean vector space V = R^{p,q} of signature (p,q) and g_1 = S is the
spinor so(V)-module extended to a g_0-module with kernel V. The remaining super
commutators {g_1,g_1} (respectively, commutators [g_1, g_1]) are defined by an
so(V)-equivariant linear mapping vee^2 g_1 -> V (respectively, wedge^2 g_1 ->
V). Denote by P^+(n,s) (respectively, P^-(n,s)) the vector space of all such
Lie super algebras (respectively, Lie algebras), where n = p + q = dim V and s
= p - q is the signature. The description of P^+-(n,s) reduces to the
construction of all so(V)-invariant bilinear forms on S and to the calculation
of three Z_2-valued invariants for some of them.
  This calculation is based on a simple explicit model of an irreducible
Clifford module S for the Clifford algebra Cl_{p,q} of arbitrary signature
(p,q). As a result of the classification, we obtain the numbers L^+-(n,s) =
\dim P^+-(n,s) of independent Lie super algebras and algebras, which take
values 0,1,2,3,4 or 6. Due to Bott periodicity, L^+-(n,s) may be considered as
periodic functions with period 8 in each argument. They are invariant under the
group Gamma generated by the four reflections with respect to the axes n=-2,
n=2, s-1 = -2 and s-1 = 2. Moreover, the reflection (n,s) -> (-n,s) with
respect to the axis s=0 interchanges L^+ and L^- : L^+(-n,s) = L^-(n,s).

mean--field ground state taken from the MIT bag model. A residual interaction
of a structure as in the Nambu--Jona--Lasinio model is used. The particle-hole
states are coupled to good total angular momentum and isospin. Valence
excitations of particle-hole type and quark--antiquark ($q\overline{q}$) states
from the Dirac--sea are included. The dependence of the baryon spectrum and
multipole response functions on the coupling constant $G$ is studied. At
critical values of $G$ the 3q--ground state becomes degenerate with strongly
collective $q\overline{q}$ modes. The model is used to calculate the electric
polarizability of the neutron $\alpha_N$. Without residual interaction
$\alpha_N=7\cdot 10^{-4}fm^3$ is found. With residual interaction the value
increases to $\alpha_N=(7-11)\cdot 10^{-4}fm^3$. The measured value of
$\alpha_N$ is reproduced within experimental error bars.
