  for publication in ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The infall of a satellite galaxy onto a galactic disk generally brings in
angular momentum that is not aligned with the axis of the disk. The main
dynamical issues addressed are what fraction of the orbital angular momentum of
the satellite and the associated energy is added to the disk, as opposed to
being left in the halo, and whether the absorbed fraction is added coherently
or thermalized in the disk. By employing fully self-consistent
disk+halo+satellite N-body simulations, we study the particular case of the
satellite and main halo having similar density profiles, with internal
velocities having the ``cosmological'' scaling $\sigma\propto M^{1/3}$. We find
that most of the orbital angular momentum of the infalling satellite is left in
the tidally stripped satellite remnants, with only $2\%$, $6\%$ and $9\%$ of
the orbital angular momentum being transferred to disks and halos for $10\%$,
$20\%$ and $30\%$ disk-mass satellites respectively. Because the disks are
tilted by the infall of $10\%$, $20\%$ and $30\%$ disk-mass satellites by
angles of $(2.9\pm0.3)^\circ$, $(6.3\pm0.1)^\circ$ and $(9.7\pm0.2)^\circ$
respectively, the kinetic energy associated with the vertical motion in the
initial coordinate frame of the three disks is respectively increased by
$(6\pm3)\%$, $(26\pm3)\%$ and $(51\pm5)\%$ whereas the corresponding disk
thermal energy associated with the vertical random motion in the tilted
coordinate frame is only increased by $(4\pm3)\%$, $(6\pm2)\%$ and
$(10\pm2)\%$, respectively. Under our initial conditions, a satellite having up
to 20\% of the disk mass would produce little observable thickening whereas a
30\% disk-mass satellite produces little observable thickening inside the
half-mass radius of the disk but great damage beyond the half-mass radius.

function of topological correlation functions and leads us to consider a
