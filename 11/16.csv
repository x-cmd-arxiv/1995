small nonlinear scales, $r$, is derived from the Press--Schechter approach.
This derivation assumes that Press--Schechter clumps are virialized and
isothermal. The virialized assumption requires that the circular velocity, $V_c
\propto M^{1/3}$, where $M$ denotes the mass of the clump. The isothermal
assumption means that the circular velocity is independent of radius. Further,
it is assumed that the velocity distribution within a clump is Maxwellian, that
the pairwise relative velocity distribution is isotropic, and that on nonlinear
scales clump-clump motions are unimportant when calculating the distribution of
velocity differences. Comparison with $N$-body simulations shows that, on small
nonlinear scales, all these assumptions are accurate. For most power spectra of
interest, the resulting line of sight, pairwise, relative velocity
distribution, $f(u_{\rm r})$, is well approximated by an exponential, rather
than a Gaussian distribution. This simple Press--Schechter model is also able
to provide a natural explanation for the observed, non-Maxwellian shape of
$f(v)$, the distribution of peculiar velocities.

  Two of the sources show multiple unresolved components, another four are
doubles with at least one resolved component, 14 show extended emission which
could arise from a disk, and two show arc-second long jets. Our data fit the
tight correlation found by Helou etal (1985) between far-infrared and microwave
luminosity; this correlation extends to the highest infrared luminosities. The
correlation is weaker if only the extended or the nuclear components of the
radio luminosity are used. Therefore the far-infrared emission in the majority
of these higher luminosity galaxies is due to the same mechanism as the lower
luminosity FIR sources, which is believed to be star formation, rather than
non-thermal activity in the nucleus. Moreover, the star formation is not
confined to the extended disk in these sources, but is important in the nucleus
as well.

rapidly with the redshift. This is interpreted as the result of a rapid
evolution of cluster galaxies, though its mechanism is not yet clear. One
hypothesis is that if galaxies run into the dense intracluster medium (ICM)
regions, starbursts can be induced due to compression of molecular clouds in
the galaxies by a raised ""external"" ICM pressure. In a merging cluster, there
would be dense ICM regions and some galaxies may experience a rapid increase of
external pressure. Thus, if the mechanism works, starbursts would occur in such
galaxies. Such a situation is considered to be realized in Coma cluster, and
galaxies showing a recent starburst have a characteristic spatial distribution;
they populate an elongated region between two sub-clusters. We examined the
above hypothesis by measuring the spatial distribution of blue galaxies,
regarded as star-forming galaxies in Abell~168 to check whether a case like
Coma is realized in this recently merging cluster. However, we could not find
an enhanced blue-galaxy distribution between two sub-clusters. We discuss the
causes of our result, including possibilities of surviving the hypothesis.

two main-sequence stars in a globular cluster. Such collisions are directly
relevant to the formation of blue stragglers. In particular, we consider parent
stars of mass $M/M_{TO}=0.2,0.5,0.75$, and $1$, where $M_{TO}$ is the cluster
turnoff mass (typically about $0.8\,M_\odot$). Low-mass stars (with $M=0.2
M_{TO}$ or $0.5 M_{TO}$) are assumed to be fully convective and are therefore
modeled as $n=1.5$ polytropes. Stars at the turnoff (with $M= M_{TO}$) are
assumed to be mostly radiative and are modeled as $n=3$ polytropes.
Intermediate-mass stars (with $M=0.75 M_{TO}$) are modeled as composite
polytropes consisting of a radiative core with polytropic index $n=3$ and a
convective envelope with $n=1.5$. We focus our study on the question of
hydrodynamic mixing of helium and hydrogen, which plays a crucial role in
determining the observable characteristics of blue stragglers. In all cases we
find that there is negligible hydrodynamic mixing of helium into the outer
envelope of the merger remnant. The amount of hydrogen mixed into the core of
the merger depends strongly on the entropy profiles of the two colliding stars.
In contrast to what has been done in previous studies, blue stragglers formed
by direct stellar collisions should not necessarily be assumed to have
initially homogeneous composition profiles.

to mitigate the effect of their resource limits in the context of particular
features of a collaborative planning task. I first motivate a number of
hypotheses about effective language behavior based on a statistical analysis of
a corpus of natural collaborative planning dialogues. These hypotheses are then
tested in a dialogue testbed whose design is motivated by the corpus analysis.
Experiments in the testbed examine the interaction between (1) agents' resource
limits in attentional capacity and inferential capacity; (2) agents' choice in
communication; and (3) features of communicative tasks that affect task
difficulty such as inferential complexity, degree of belief coordination
required, and tolerance for errors. The results show that good algorithms for
communication must be defined relative to the agents' resource limits and the
features of the task. Algorithms that are inefficient for inferentially simple,
low coordination or fault-tolerant tasks are effective when tasks require
coordination or complex inferences, or are fault-intolerant. The results
provide an explanation for the occurrence of utterances in human dialogues
that, prima facie, appear inefficient, and provide the basis for the design of
effective algorithms for communicative choice for resource limited agents.

of a massless, conformally coupled scalar field, with a conformal vacuum. The
back-reaction causes an instability of the universe: The torus becomes thinner
and thinner as it evolves, while its total 2-volume (area) becomes smaller and
smaller. The back-reaction caused by the Casimir energy can be compared with
the influence of the negative cosmological constant: Both of them make the
system unstable and the torus becomes thinner and thinner in shape. On the

  ""Non-perturbative approaches to QCD"", July 10-29, 1995, Trento, Italy",,,"INLO-PUB-19/95","hep-th",,"  We review the global issues associated to gauge fixing ambiguities and their
consequence for glueball spectroscopy. To avoid infrared singularities the
theory is formulated in a finite volume. The examples of a cubic and spherical
geometry will be discussed in some detail. Our methods are not powerful enough
to study the infinite volume limit, but the results clearly indicate that for
low-lying states, wave functionals are sensitive to global gauge copies which
we will argue is equivalent to saying that they are sensitive to the geometric
and topological features of configuration space.

"hep-th/9511120","Giovanni Felder","Giovanni Felder, Alexander Varchenko","Three formulas for eigenfunctions of integrable Schroedinger operators","29 pages, AMSLaTeX",,,,"hep-th",,"  We give three formulas for meromorphic eigenfunctions (scattering states) of
Sutherland's integrable N-body Schroedinger operators and their
generalizations. The first is an explicit computation of the Etingof-Kirillov
traces of intertwining operators, the second an integral representation of
hypergeometric type, and the third is a formula of Bethe ansatz type. The last
two formulas are degenerations of elliptic formulas obtained previously in
connection with the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equation. The Bethe ansatz
formulas in the elliptic case are reviewed and discussed in more detail here:
Eigenfunctions are parametrized by a ``Hermite-Bethe'' variety, a
generalization of the spectral variety of the Lame' operator. We also give the
q-deformed version of our first formula. In the scalar sl_N case, this gives
common eigenfunctions of the commuting Macdonald-Rujsenaars difference
operators.

a non-Fredholm operator for which all spectral asymmetry comes entirely from
the continuous spectrum. In this case one finds that the use of standard
definitions of the resolvent regularized, the heat kernel regularized, and the
Witten indices misses the contribution coming from the continuous spectrum and
gives vanishing spectral asymmetry and axial anomaly. This behaviour in the
case of the continuous spectrum seems to be general and its origin is
discussed.

construction of quantum networks effecting basic arithmetic operations: from
addition to modular exponentiation. Quantum modular exponentiation seems to be
the most difficult (time and space consuming) part of Shor's quantum
factorising algorithm. We show that the auxiliary memory required to perform
this operation in a reversible way grows linearly with the size of the number
to be factorised.
