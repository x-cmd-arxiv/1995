are analyzed, on the basis of stellar evolution models for horizontal-branch
(HB) and red giant branch stars. These have been incorporated into detailed
synthetic HB models, the influence of differential reddening upon which is also
discussed. The synthetic HB models are found to be very clumpy in the
colour-magnitude diagram, though more extended structures occasionally result
due to the effect of evolution away from the zero-age HB. In particular,
""sloped"" clumps may be naturally expected for sufficiently high helium
abundances. Differential reddening is found to have a smaller influence than
evolution itself upon the morphology of the clump. The synthetic HB models are
also used to study the age difference between metal-rich clusters on the basis
of the ""$\Delta V$"" method. We emphasize the importance of knowing in advance
the relative abundances of helium and metals in order to estimate this age
difference quantitatively. We present chemical evolution models that serve to
illustrate the effect, and show that, for two clusters of identical [Fe/H] and
$\Delta V$, the one enriched predominantly by ejecta from supernovae type II
explosions will appear younger than the other which also suffered enrichment
from supernovae type Ia ejecta. The implied locations of the red giant branch
feature known as the ""bump"" are also discussed on the basis of recent
observational and theoretical results. Our corresponding predictions should be
checked against accurate observational data obtained with the Hubble Space

particles moving self-consistently in an N-body realisation of a King model are
computed from the probability per unit time, P(E, Delta E), that a star with
initial energy E will undergo an energy change Delta E. In turn, P is computed
from the number of times during the simulation that a particle in a state of
given energy undergoes a transition to another state. These particle states are
defined directly from the time evolution of E by identifying them with the
event occuring between two local maxima in the E(t) curve. If one assumes next
that energy changes are uncorrelated between different states, one can use
diffusion theory to compute D_n(E). The simulations employ N=512, 2048,... ,
32768 particles and are performed using an implementation of Aarseth's direct
integrator N-body1 on a massively parallel computer. The more than seven
million transitions measured in the largest N simulation provide excellent
statistics. The numerically determined D(E)'s are compared against their
theoretical counterparts which are computed from phase-space averaged rates of
energy change due to independent binary encounters. The overall agreement
between them is impressive over most of the energy range, notwithstanding the
very different type of approximations involved, giving considerable support to
the valid usage of these theoretical expressions to simulate dynamical
evolution in Fokker-Planck type calculations.

IRAS galaxies means that warm and cool samples drawn from a flux-limited sample
like QDOT will sample quite different volumes of space. To overcome this
problem, and to distinguish truly temperature-dependent results from those
depending directly on the volume of space sampled, we consider a pair of

well as pairs of samples selected using a simple temperature cut. ...(abstract

reflects the local cosmography, rather than the physical properties of the

the spectrum of density perturbations and gravitational waves at the end of

  Two disk simulations for a binary with mass ratio $q=\frac{3}{17}$ (similar
to OY~Car) are performed, in order to investigate the Lubow (1991 a,b) tidal
resonance instability mechanism. In the first calculation, a disk evolves under
steady mass transfer from $L_1$. In the second simulation, mass is added in
Keplerian orbit to the inner disk.
  The two disks follow similar evolutionary paths. However the $L_1$
stream-disk interaction is found to slow the disk's radial expansion and to
circularise gas orbits.
  The initial eccentricity growth in our simulations is exponential at a rate
slightly less than predicted by Lubow (1991a). We do not observe a clearing of
material from the resonance region via the disk's tidal response to the $m=2$
component of the binary potential as was described in Lubow (1992). Instead the
$m=2$ response weakens as the disk eccentricty increases.
  Both disks reach an eccentric equilibrium state, in which they undergo
prograde precession. The rate of viscous energy dissipation in the disks has a
periodic excess with a period matching the disk's rotation. The source is
identified as a large region in the outer disk, and the mechanism by which it
is produced is identified. The time taken for the periodic excess to develop is
consistent with the first appearance of superhumps in a superoutburst.

We sum a class of large ``pi^2 terms'' and reorganize the series so as to
minimize ``renormalon'' effects. We also consider the renormalization
scheme-scale ambiguity of the perturbative results. We find that, with three
nontrivial known terms in the perturbative expansion, the treatment of the pi^2
terms is quite important, while renormalon effects are less important. The
measured hadronic width of the Z is often used to determine the value of
alpha_s(M_Z^2). A standard method is to use the perturbative expansion for the
width truncated at order alpha_s^3 in the MS-bar scheme with scale mu = M_Z. We
estimate that the determined value of alpha_s(M_Z^2) should be increased by
0.6% compared to the value extracted with this standard method. After this
adjustment for pi^2 and renormalon effects, we estimate that the uncertainty in
alpha_s(M_Z^2) arising from QCD theory is about 0.4%. This is, of course, much
less than the experimental uncertainty of about 5%.
