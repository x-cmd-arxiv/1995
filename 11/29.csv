grow to the Chandrasekhar mass are more likely found in spiral galaxies, and
absent from early-type galaxies. SNe Ia statistics could (if the uncertainties

scenarios. The range of variation of the characteristics of SNe Ia in the CLS
scenario should be narrower than in symbiotics. The predicted correlation

plane is log r_e=1.24 log sigma - 0.82 log <I>_e + cst. The scatter is 0.084 in
log r_e. The slope of the FP is not significantly different from cluster to
cluster. The residuals of the FP correlate weakly with the velocity dispersion
and the surface brightness. Thus, to avoid biases of derived distances the
galaxies need to be selected in a homogeneous way. The FP has significant
intrinsic scatter. No other structural parameters like ellipticity or isophotal
shape can reduce the scatter significantly. The Mg_2-sigma relation differs
slightly from cluster to cluster. Galaxies in clusters with lower velocity
dispersions have systematically lower Mg_2. With the current stellar population
models, it is in best agreement with our results regarding the FP if the
offsets are mainly caused by differences in metallicity. Most of the distances
that we derive from the FP imply small peculiar motions, <1000km/s. The zero
point of the FP must therefore be quite stable. The residuals from the
Mg_2-sigma relation may be used to flag galaxies with deviant populations, and
possibly to correct the distance determinations for the deviations.

fraught with difficulty due to uncertainties in the overall galaxy population
(mix of morphological types, luminosity functions etc.) and in the observations
(loss of low surface brightness images, image blending etc.). Many of these can
be overcome if we use deep high resolution imaging of a single class of high
surface brightness galaxies, whose evolution is thought to be fairly well
understood. This is now possible by selecting elliptical and S0 galaxies using
Hubble Space Telescope images from the Medium Deep Survey and other ultradeep
WFPC2 images. In the present paper, we examine whether such data can be used to
discriminate between open and closed universes, or between conventional
cosmological models and those dominated by a cosmological constant. We find,
based on the currently available data, that unless elliptical galaxies undergo
very strong merging since $z \sim 1$ (and/or very large errors exist in the
morphological classifications), then flat models dominated by a cosmological
constant are ruled out. However, both an Einstein-de Sitter ($\Omega_{0}=1$)
model with standard passive stellar evolution and an open ($\Omega_{0}=0.05$)
model with no net evolution ({\it i.e.} cancelling stellar and dynamical
evolution) predict virtually identical elliptical and S0 galaxy counts.
  Based on these findings and the recent reportings of $H_{o} \simeq 80$ km/s
Mpc/s, we find that the maximum acceptable age of the universe is 13.3 Gyrs and
a value of $\leq 9$ Gyrs favored. A flat---$\Lambda \neq 0$---universe is
therefore {\it not} a viable solution to the $H_{o}$/globular cluster age
problem.

The (revised) line flux from $^{44}$Ti decay in the Cas A supernova remnant
reported by COMPTEL on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory is near the upper
bound expected from our models. The necessary concurrent ejection of $^{56}$Ni
would also imply that Cas A was a brighter supernova than previously thought
unless extinction in the intervening matter was very large. Thus, if confirmed,
the reported amount of $^{44}$Ti in Cas A provides very interesting constraints
on both the supernova environment and its mechanism. The abundances of
$^{44}$Ti and $^{60}$Co ejected by Type II supernovae are such that
gamma-radiation from $^{44}$Ti decay SN 1987A could be detected by a future
generation of gamma-ray telescopes and that the decay of $^{60}$Co might
provide an interesting contribution to the late time light curve of SN 1987A

proposed here which, while giving small CKM angles, naturally leads to neutrino

quantum fields become trivial in the continuum limit for sufficiently high
space-time dimensions, and in particular the moment generating functional for
space-time smeared fields becomes a Gaussian appropriate to that of a (possibly
generalized) free field. For sharp-time fields this fact implies that the
ground-state expectation functional also becomes Gaussian in the continuum
limit. To overcome these consequences of the central limit theorem, an
auxiliary, nonclassical potential is appended to the original lattice form of
the model and parameters are tuned so that a generalized Poisson field
distribution emerges in the continuum limit for the ground-state probability
distribution. As a consequence, the sharp-time expectation functional is
infinitely divisible, but the Hamiltonian operator is such, in the general
case, that the generating functional for the space-time smeared field is not
infinitely divisible in Minkowski space. This feature permits the models in
question to escape a manifestly trivial scattering matrix imposed on all
infinitely divisible covariant Minkowski fields. Two sequentially related
proposals for an alternative lattice formulation of interacting covariant
models in four and more space-time dimensions are analyzed in some detail.

This ""other"" spectral flow does not interpolate between the chiral ring and the
