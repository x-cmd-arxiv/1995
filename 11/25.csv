systems -the $q$-state quantum Potts and clock models. For models with purely
ferromagnetic interactions in one dimension, we show that for strong randomness
there is a second order transition with critical properties that can be
determined exactly by use of an RG procedure. Somewhat surprisingly, the
critical behaviour is completely independent of $q$ (for $2 \leq q < \infty$).
For the $q > 4$ clock model, we suggest the existence of a novel multicritical
point at intermediate randomness. We also consider the $T = 0$ transition from
a paramagnet to a spin glass in an infinite range model. Assuming that the
transition is second order, we solve for the critical behaviour and find $q$
independent exponents.

containing Dirac nucleons and classical scalar and vector meson fields is
discussed. Density functional theory implies that this energy functional can
include many-body effects that go beyond the simple Hartree approximation.
Using basic ideas from effective field theory, a systematic truncation scheme
is developed for the energy functional, which is based on an expansion in
powers of the meson fields and their gradients.
  Chiral models are analyzed by considering specific lagrangians that realize
the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of QCD in different ways and by
studying them at the Hartree level. Models that include a light scalar meson
playing a dual role as the chiral partner of the pion and the mediator of the
intermediate-range nucleon-nucleon interaction, and which include a
""Mexican-hat"" potential, fail to reproduce basic ground-state properties of
nuclei. In contrast, chiral models with a nonlinear realization of the symmetry
are shown to contain the full flexibility inherent in the general energy
functional and can therefore successfully describe nuclei.
