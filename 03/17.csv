via neutral currents and exchange energy with the stellar gas predominantly by
neutrino-electron scattering and neutrino-pair processes. In contrast, electron
neutrinos and antineutrinos ($\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$) are frequently absorbed
and produced in charged-current mediated reactions with nucleons. Therefore the
emergent $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$ originate from layers with lower temperatures
further out in the star and are emitted with much lower characteristic spectral
temperatures. In addition, a major contribution to the $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$
opacities is due to absorptions, while the opacity of $\nu_x$ is strongly
dominated by scattering reactions with nucleons and nuclei in which the $\nu_x$
energy is (essentially) conserved. Therefore the $\nu_x$ distribution is nearly
isotropic when $\nu_x$ decouple energetically and their outward diffusion is
slowed down. In a generalized form to include this effect, the Stefan-Boltzmann
Radiation Law can account for both the facts that $\nu_e$ ($\bar\nu_e$) and
$\nu_x$ emerge from the star with similar luminosities but with very different
characteristic spectral temperatures. Simple analytical expressions to estimate
the effect are given. If, as recently argued, even at densities significantly
below nuclear matter density neutral-current scatterings were associated with
considerable energy transfer between neutrino and target particle, one might
expect spectral temperatures of $\nu_x$ much closer to those of $\nu_e$ and
$\bar\nu_e$. This is of relevance for the detection of neutrino signals from
supernovae.

optically thin to pair production by photon-photon collisions in order to
produce the observed nonthermal spectra. We derive probability distributions
for the minimum Lorentz expansion factor, the radiation energy, the maximum
baryonic mass, and the maximum surrounding gas density in the events, based on
254 events from the second BATSE catalog. Secondly, the time variabilities of
the bursts in the BATSE catalog are used to place an upper bound on the
curvature radius of the emitting surface in the events. This is based on the
requirement that the emitting region seen by the observer must be sufficiently
small to produce the observed variability without violating causality. Finally,
we discuss the association of cosmological GRB with galaxies. We consider eight
bright and well-localized bursts detected by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, whose
positional error boxes contain no bright galaxies. Using the local luminosity
function of galaxies, we calculate the probability for not seeing the GRB host
galaxy. This probability tends to increase as the width of the GRB luminosity
function increases. However, the allowed width of the GRB luminosity function
is restricted by the number-count statistics of the bursts.

various B/D data sets we pay particular attention to disentangling the role
played by the galaxy morphology--galaxy density relation. Besides, we focus our
attention on nearby ($z<0.01$) galaxies, for which we can provide a
three-dimensional characterization of the local galaxy density. We find that
the observed tendency of galaxies to have greater B/D with increasing galaxy
density simply reflects the average decline of B/D towards later morphological
types together with the morphology--density relation. This relation tends to
give rise also to a greater proportion of bright bulges in denser regions,
because the decrease of B/D towards later types is mostly due to a dimming of
the bulge rather than to a brightening of the disk. But when we remove the
effect induced by the morphology--density relation, we detect no clear evidence
of a dependence of B/D on galaxy density. Furthermore, B/D turns out to be
substantially unrelated to the blue absolute magnitude of the galaxy. We
briefly discuss to what extent our results (partially) disagree with previous
claims.

to pulsars has been investigated by assuming aligned vacuum and non-vacuum
magnetosphere models. For this purpose the stationary and axisymmetric vector
potential in Schwarzschild geometry has been considered and the corresponding
expressions for the induced electric field due to the rotation of the magnetic
dipole have been derived for both vacuum and non-vacuum conditions. Due to the
change in the magnetic dipole field in curved spacetime the induced electric
field also changes its magnitude and direction and increases significantly near
the surface of the star. As a consequence the surface charge density, the
acceleration of charged particles in vacuum magnetospheres and the space charge
density in non-vacuum magnetosphere greatly increase near the surface of the
star. The results provide the most general feature of the important role played
by gravitation and could have several potentially important implications for
the production of high-energy radiation from pulsars.

coherence. The mechanism by which the quantum radiation is emitted appears to
be insensitive to the detailed history of the black hole, and thus it seems
that most of the initial information is lost for an outside observer. However,
direct examination of Hawking's original derivation (or any later one) of the
black hole emission spectrum shows that one inevitably needs to make reference
to particle waves that have arbitrarily high frequency near the horizon as
measured in the reference frame of the in-falling matter. This exponential
red-shift effect associated with the black hole horizon leads to a breakdown of
the usual separation of length scales, and effectively works as a magnifying
glass that makes the consequences of the short distance, or rather, high energy
physics near the horizon visible at larger scales to an asymptotic observer.
