on the strength of the neutrino heating during the first few 100 ms after shock

been examined by using a mapping onto a 2D XY-model with random an\-iso\-tropy
but without vortices and applying a renormalization group treatment to the
replicated Hamiltonian based on the mapping to a Coulomb gas of vector charges.
This renormalization group approach is extended by deriving renormalization
group flow equations which take into account the possibility of a one-step
replica symmetry breaking. It is shown that the renormalization group flow is
unstable with respect to replica asymmetric perturbations and new fixed points
with a broken replica symmetry are obtained. Approaching these fixed points the
system can optimize its free energy contributions from fluctuations on large
length scales; an optimal block size parameter $m$ can be found. Correlation
functions for the case of a broken replica symmetry can be calculated. We
obtain both correlations diverging as $\ln{r}$ and $\ln^2{r}$ depending on the
choice of $m$.

The form of the mass matrices, rather than being imposed arbitrarily, emerges
naturally from a simple structure at the unification scale. This structure
involves only vector, spinor and adjoint representations. There are distinctive
and testable predictions for $\tan \beta$ and the neutrino mixing angles.

effects of flavor changing neutral current on the unitary triangle of
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. In the case when the unitarity is nearly
conserved, we find that the allowed FCNC in the $db$ sector is $\left|
{{z_d}^{db}}/{{V_{CKM}}^{td} {{V_{CKM}}^{tb}}^\ast} \right| \sim O({10}^{-2})$,
from the evaluation of the present bounds for the mixing size of neutral $B$
meson ($x_d$), and the $CP$ violation parameter in the neutral $K$ meson
($\epsilon$). Although the size is small, the new physics due to the tree-level
FCNC in the $db$ sector is expected to be visible in the $B \rightarrow X_d \,
l^+ \, l^- $ and the $CP$ asymmetries in the neutral $B$ meson system. In the

is large enough, i.e. $\left| {{z_d}^{db}}/{{V_{CKM}}^{td}

also expected in the inclusive $B \rightarrow X_d \, \gamma$ decay.

contributions to hadronic weak decays of mesons, are updated by extracting them
from the data of $D,\,B\to PP,~VP$ decays ($P$: pseudoscalar meson, $V$: vector
meson). It is found that $\chi_2$ ranges from $-0.36$ to $-0.60$ in the decays
from $D\to\bar{K}\pi$ to $D^+\to\phi\pi^+,~D\to\bar{K}^*\pi$, while it is of
order 10\% with a positive sign in $B\to\psi K,~D\pi,~D^*\pi,~D\rho$ decays.
Therefore, the effective parameter $a_2$ is process dependent in charm decay,
whereas it stays fairly stable in $B$ decay. This implies the picture that
nonfactorizable effects become stronger when the decay particles become less
energetic after hadronization. As for $D,\,B\to VV$ decays, the presence of
nonfactorizable terms in general prevents a possible definition of effective
$a_1$ and $a_2$. This is reenforced by the observation of a large longitudinal
polarization fraction in $B\to\psi K^*$ decay, implying $S$-wave dominated
nonfactorizable effects. The nonfactorizable term dominated by the $S$-wave is
also essential for understanding the decay rate of $B^-\to D^{*0} \rho^-$. It
is found that all nonfactorizable effects $A_1^{nf}/A_1^{BK^*},~A
_1^{nf}/A_1^{B\rho},~A_1^{nf}/A_1^{BD^*}$ ($nf$ standing for nonfactorization)
are positive and of order 10\%, in accordance with $\chi_2(B\to D(D^*)\pi(
\rho))$ and $\chi_2(B\to\psi K)$. However, we show that in $D\to\bar{K}^*\rho$
decay nonfactorizable effects cannot be dominated by the $S$-wave. A
polarization measurement in the color- and Cabibbo-suppressed decay mode
$D^+\to\phi\rho^+$ is strongly urged in order to test if $A_2^{nf}/A_2$ plays a
more pivotal role than $A_1^{nf}/A_1$ in charm decay.

plane and at random times and then expand at some velocity $v_{\rm b}<c$.
Within each bubble, the phase angle is assigned one of three discrete values.
When bubbles collide, magnetic `fluxons' appear: if the phases are different, a
fluxon--anti-fluxon pair is formed. These fluxons are eventually trapped in
three-bubble collisions when they may annihilate or form quantized vortices. We
study in particular the effect of changing the bubble expansion speed on the
vortex density and the extent of vortex--anti-vortex correlation.
