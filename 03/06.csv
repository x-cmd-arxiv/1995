  upon request. MNRAS in press.",,"10.1093/mnras/274.1.1",,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss the results of a campaign to monitor spectral variations in the
low-luminosity Seyfert~1 galaxy NGC~4593, at X-rays, ultraviolet, optical and
near IR frequencies. The observations and data analysis have been described in
a companion paper (Santos-Lle\'o et al. 1994; Paper~1). The active nucleus in
this galaxy is strongly and rapidly variable in all wavebands, implying that
the continuum source is unusually compact. Its energy distribution from
1.2~$\mu$m to 1200~\AA\/ obeys a power-law whose index is significantly steeper
than is usual in Seyfert's or QSO's; the ``big bump'' is either absent or
shifted to wavelengths shorter than 1200~\AA\/. The variations of the
soft-X~ray {\em excess\/} do not correlate with those of the UV or hard X-ray
continuum. The far UV and optical fluxes are well correlated, while the
correlation between the hard X-rays and 1447 \AA\ continuum is only marginally
significant. Moreover, the optical flux cannot lag behind the UV by more than 6
days. These results cannot be accommodated in the framework of the standard
geometrically thin accretion disk model. Rather, they suggest that the bulk of
the UV and optical flux originates from thermal reprocessing of X-rays
irradiating the disk. The soft X-ray excess is probably the only spectral
component which originates from viscous dissipation inside the disk and the
near infrared is probably emitted by hot dust heated by the UV radiation. Such
a model is consistent with NGC~4593 having a relatively small black-hole mass
of the order of $2\times10^{6}{\rm M_{\odot}}$ as inferred from the line
variability study. The high ionization/excitation emission lines are very broad
and strongly variable and their variations correlate with those of the
continuum. The low excitation lines are significantly narrower and remain
constant within the accuracy of our measurements. These results suggest a
stratified BLR, where the degree of ionization and the velocity dispersion of
the gas increase toward small radii. The \lya\ line responds to the variations
of the continuum with a delay $\leq 4$ days. To a first order approximation,
the BLR in NGC~4593 is well modelled with two different zones at distances of
$\sim$~15 and 3 lt-ds from the ionizing source respectively.

in an Einstein-de Sitter universe is widely believed to be self-similar for
$-3<n<4$. However, for $-3<n<-1$ the existence of self-similar scaling has not
been adequately demonstrated. Here we investigate the possible breaking of
self-similar scaling due to the nonlinear contributions of long wave modes. For
$n<-1$ the nonlinear terms in the Fourier space fluid equations contain terms
that diverge due to contributions from wavenumber $k\to 0$ (the long wave
limit). To assess the possible dynamical effects of this divergence the limit
of long wave contributions is investigated in detail using two different
analytical approaches.
  Perturbative contributions to the power spectrum are examined. It is shown
that for $n<-1$ there are divergent contributions at all orders. However, at
every order the leading order divergent terms cancel out exactly. This does not
rule out the existence of a weaker but nevertheless divergent net contribution.
The second approach consists of a non-perturbative approximation, developed to
study the nonlinear effects of long wave mode coupling. A solution for the
phase shift of the Fourier space density is obtained which is divergent for
$n<-1$. A kinematical interpretation of the divergence of the phase shift,
related to the translational motion induced by the large-scale bulk velocity,
is given. Our analysis indicates that the amplitude of the density is {\it not}
affected by the divergent terms. Thus both analytical approaches lead to the
conclusion that the self-similar scaling of physically relevant measures of the
growth of density perturbations is preserved.

1.4, 3.0 and 10) relative to a homogeneous and slightly perturbed medium, which
is taken to be an ideal gas ($\gamma=4/3$). We examine the influence of Mach
number of the flow and size of the accretor upon the physical behaviour of the
flow and the accretion rates. The hydrodynamics is modeled by the ``Piecewise
Parabolic Method'' (PPM). The resolution in the vicinity of the accretor is
increased by multiply nesting several $32^3$-zone grids around the sphere, each
finer grid being a factor of two smaller in zone dimension than the next
coarser grid. This allows us to include a coarse model for the surface of the
accretor (vacuum sphere) on the finest grid while at the same time evolving the
gas on the coarser grids. For small Mach numbers (0.6 and~1.4) the flow
patterns tend towards a steady state, while in the case of supersonic flow
(Mach~3 and~10) and small enough accretors, (radius of~0.1 and~0.02 accretion
radii) an unstable Mach cone develops, destroying axisymmetry. Our 3D models do
not show the highly dynamic flip-flop flow so prominent in 2D calculations
performed by other authors. In the gamma=4/3 models, the shock front remains
closer to the accretor and the mass accretion rates are higher than in the
gamma=5/3 models, whereas the rms of the specific angular momentum accreted
does not change.

systematically shifted with respect to the fiducial lines traced by the models.
The scenario confirms that a certain degree of oxygen enhancement would be
necessary to obtain a better agreement between observed data and theoretical
predictions. This enhancement, however, removes some of the disagreement, but
not all of it. The dependence of the observed $Fe_{52}$ and $H_\beta$ indices

some results were also discussed from a statistical point of view. A principal

bound of a four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetry. The massive four-dimensional
double-bound states (Bogomolny states) are shown to form a light-like
representation of ten-dimensional supersymmetry. The single-bound states form a
massive representation (centrino multiplet) of a four-dimensional
supersymmetry. The first component of the centrino multiplet is identified with
extreme black holes with regular horizon which have one quarter of unbroken
supersymmetry. The centrino multiplet includes a massive spin 3/2 state, the
centrino, as a highest spin state.
  Existence of massive black hole supermultiplets may affect the massless
sector of the theory. Assuming that gluino condensate is formed one can study
its properties. The bilinear combination of covariantly constant Killing
spinors supplies the possible form for a gluino condensate. The condensate has
null properties, does not introduce a cosmological constant, and may lead to a
spontaneous breaking of local supersymmetry. This suggests that centrino may
provide a consistent super-Higgs mechanism.

Yang-Mills or the type-I $SO(32)$ string theory are compactified on magnetized
tori. Because of the universal gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$, the splittings of all
multiplets are given by the product of charge times internal helicity
operators. As a result such compactifications have two remarkable and robust
features: {\it (a)} they can reconcile {\it chirality} with {\it extended}
low-energy supersymmetry in the limit of large tori, and {\it (b)} they can
trigger gauge-symmetry breaking, via Nielsen-Olesen instabilities, at a scale
tied classically to $m_{SUSY}$. I exhibit a compactification of the $SO(32)$
superstring, in which magnetic fields break spontaneously $N=4$ supersymmetry,
produce the standard-model gauge group with three chiral families of quarks and
leptons, and trigger electroweak symmetry breaking. I discuss supertrace
relations and the ensuing ultraviolet softness. As with other known mechanisms
of supersymmetry breaking, the one proposed here faces two open problems: the
threat to perturbative calculability in the decompactification limit, and the
problem of gravitational stability and in particular of the cosmological
constant. I explain, however, why a good classical description of the vacuum
may require small tadpoles for the dilaton, moduli and metric.

concepts from higher-dimensional algebra such as n-categories and n-vector
spaces. We review progress towards a definition of n-category suited for this
purpose, and outline a program in which n-dimensional TQFTs are to be described
as n-category representations. First we describe a ""suspension"" operation on
n-categories, and hypothesize that the k-fold suspension of a weak n-category
stabilizes for k >= n+2. We give evidence for this hypothesis and describe its
relation to stable homotopy theory. We then propose a description of
n-dimensional unitary extended TQFTs as weak n-functors from the ""free stable
weak n-category with duals on one object"" to the n-category of ""n-Hilbert
spaces"". We conclude by describing n-categorical generalizations of deformation
quantization and the quantum double construction.
