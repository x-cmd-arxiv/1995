Universe with its quasi-regular pattern of superclusters and voids has been
pointed out by several authors. In this paper, we investigate properties of the
initial power spectrum which lead to prediction of structure consistent with
these observations.For this purpose, we analyze the evolution of structure
within four sets of 2- and 3-dimensional cosmological models, which differ in
their initial power spectrum. The models include HDM and CDM models as well as
double power-law models. We discuss in detail the impact of model parameters
such as the large scale and small scale power and the position and height of
the maxima of the power spectra on the predicted structure. The best agreement
with observations was observed in the model with the Harrison-Zeldovich
spectrum on large scales, a power index $n\approx -1.5$ on small scales, and a
maximum of the power spectrum at $\approx 130$~\Mpc. In this model the
distribution of masses of clusters and superclusters, the correlation function
of clusters, and the void distribution reproduce well the respective observed
distributions. We also investigated the dynamical evolution of the
supercluster-void structure. The results show that the basic supercluster-void
network is formed very early and is essentially given by initial conditions.

  Journal Letters",,"10.1086/187895",,"astro-ph",,"  Although numerous studies of individual galaxy clusters have demonstrated the
presence of significant substructure, previous studies of the distribution of
masses of galaxy clusters determined from optical observations have failed to
explicitly correct for substructure in those systems. In this {\it Letter} I
present the distributions of velocity dispersion, mean separation, and
dynamical masses of clusters when substructure is eliminated from the cluster
datasets. I also discuss the changes in these distributions because of the
substructure correction. Comparing the masses of clusters with central galaxies
before and after correction for the presence of substructure reveals a
significant change. This change is driven by reductions in the mean separation
of galaxies, not by a decrease in the velocity dispersions as has generally
been assumed. Correction for substructure reduces most significantly the masses
of systems with cool X-ray temperatures, suggesting that the use of a constant
linear radius (1.5$h _{100} ^{-1}$ Mpc in this study) to determine cluster
membership is inappropriate for clusters spanning a range of temperatures
and/or morphologies.

symplectomorphisms of the symplectic manifold $(M,\om)$ with the Hofer
$L^{\infty}$-norm. A path in $\Ham^c(M)$ will be called a geodesic if all
sufficiently short pieces of it are local minima for the Hofer length
functional $\Ll$. In this paper, we give a necessary condition for a path $\ga$
to be a geodesic. We also develop a necessary condition for a geodesic to be
stable, that is, a local minimum for $\Ll$. This condition is related to the
existence of periodic orbits for the linearization of the path, and so extends
Ustilovsky's work on the second variation formula. Using it, we construct a
symplectomorphism of $S^2$ which cannot be reached from the identity by a
shortest path. In later papers in this series, we will use holomorphic methods
to prove the sufficiency of the condition given here for the characterisation
of geodesics as well as the sufficiency of the condition for the stability of
geodesics. We will also investigate conditions under which geodesics are
absolutely length-minimizing.

previous paper is also a sufficient condition for a path to be a geodesic in
the group $\Ham^c(M)$ of compactly supported Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms.
This applies with no restriction on $M$. We then discuss conditions which
guarantee that such a path minimizes the Hofer length. Our argument relies on a
general geometric construction (the gluing of monodromies) and on an extension
of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem both to more general manifolds and to more
general capacities. The manifolds we consider are quasi-cylinders, that is
spaces homeomorphic to $M \times D^2$ which are symplectically ruled over
$D^2$. When we work with the usual capacity (derived from embedded balls), we
can prove the existence of paths which minimize the length among all homotopic
paths, provided that $M$ is semi-monotone. (This restriction occurs because of
the well-known difficulty with the theory of $J$-holomorphic curves in
arbitrary $M$.) However, we can only prove the existence of length-minimizing
paths (i.e. paths which minimize length amongst {\it all} paths, not only the
homotopic ones) under even more restrictive conditions on $M$, for example when
$M$ is exact and convex or of dimension $2$. The new difficulty is caused by
the possibility that there are non-trivial and very short loops in $\Ham^c(M)$.
When such length-minimizing paths do exist, we can extend the
Bialy--Polterovich calculation of the Hofer norm on a neighbourhood of the
identity ($C^1$-flatness).

For each Poisson manifold $P$ with a Poisson action by a Poisson Lie group $G$,
we describe a Lie algebroid structure on the direct sum vector bundle $P \times

built out of the transformation Lie algebroid $P \times {\frak g}$ and the
cotangent bundle Lie algebroid $T^*P$ together with a pair of representations
of them on each other. When the action of $G$ on $P$ is transitive, the kernel
of the anchor map of this Lie algebroid gives a Lie algebra bundle over $P$,
the fibers of which are given by Drinfeld. As applications, we describe the
symplectic leaves and the $G$-invariant Poisson cohomology of Poisson
homogeneous $G$-spaces.

corresponding superposition of outputs. It has been recently demonstrated that
such computers can dramatically speed up the task of finding factors of large
numbers -- a problem of great practical significance because of its
cryptographic applications. Instead of the nearly exponential ($\sim \exp
L^{1/3}$, for a number with $L$ digits) time required by the fastest classical
algorithm, the quantum algorithm gives factors in a time polynomial in $L$
($\sim L^2$). This enormous speed-up is possible in principle because quantum
computation can simultaneously follow all of the paths corresponding to the
distinct classical inputs, obtaining the solution as a result of coherent
quantum interference between the alternatives. Hence, a quantum computer is
sophisticated interference device, and it is essential for its quantum state to
remain coherent in the course of the operation. In this report we investigate
the effect of decoherence on the quantum factorization algorithm and establish
an upper bound on a ``quantum factorizable'' $L$ based on the decoherence
suffered per operational step.

interaction with an environment of harmonic oscillators in a thermal state,
using the quantum state diffusion (QSD) picture of Gisin and Percival, in which
one associates the usual Markovian master equation for the density operator
with a class of stochastic non-linear Schr\""odinger equations. We find
stationary solutions to the Ito equation which are Gaussians, localized around
a point in phase space undergoing classical Brownian motion. We show that every
initial state approaches these stationary solutions in the long time limit. We
recover the density operator corresponding to these solutions, and thus show,
for this particular model, that the QSD picture effectively supplies a
prescription for approximately diagonalizing the density operator in a basis of
phase space localized states. The rate of localization is related to the
decoherence time, and also to the timescale on which thermal and quantum
fluctuations become comparable. We use these results to exemplify the general
connection between the QSD picture and the decoherent histories approach.
