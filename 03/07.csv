galaxies selected at 12$\mu$m and recently compiled by Rush, Malkan \&
Spinoglio (1993). As a necessary complement we also study the IR emissivity of
the largest sample of hard X--ray selected AGN (Grossan 1992). Our purposes are
to probe the unified scheme of active nuclei and to evaluate the local X--ray
volume emissivity of low luminosity and `hidden' AGN. We confirm that X-ray
emission is basically restricted to AGN, Seyfert 1's being much more powerful
emitters than Seyfert 2's. We find no signal of X-ray emission for the
remaining galaxies selected at $12\mu$m, not even for those having a flat
far-infrared spectrum, which would be prime candidates to host hidden AGN. Our
result on the local volume emissivity of the Seyfert 1's is fully consistent
with those derived from studies of the hard X--ray luminosity function. However
the 95$\%$ upper limits to the local emissivity we derive for the Seyfert 2
class and for the most likely `hidden' AGN candidates, severely constrain (and
in some cases exclude) models of the X--ray background based on the unified
Seyfert scheme. We also find that less than $\sim20$\% of Seyfert 1-like AGN
and less than $\sim 50$\% of Seyfert 2-like AGN can be `hidden' in the
non-Seyfert galaxy samples assuming that the X-ray to 12$\mu$m flux ratios
measured in the 12$\mu$m selected samples can be considered typical for these
classes of objects. In this case, the number ratio of Seyfert 2 to Seyfert 1
galaxies ranges from 1 to 2.

undertaken an investigation into the interaction that produced the well known
merger remnant NGC 7252. Through fully self-consistent N-body simulations, we
are able to reproduce the kinematic character of the HI observations quite
well, including the velocity reversals observed along each tidal tail. In the
simulation these reversals arise from particles which have turned around in
their orbit and are moving to smaller radii. The bases of the tails fall back
quickly to small pericentric distances, while the more distant regions fall
back more slowly to ever increasing pericentric distances. The delayed return
of tidally ejected material may extend over many Gyr. The evolution of this
merger is followed numerically for 800 h^-1 Myr beyond the best fit time. We
find that nearly half of the present tail material, or of order 10^9 h^-2 of
neutral hydrogen and 2x10^9 h^-2 of starlight, will return to within 13 h^-1
kpc of the nucleus within this time span. While the collisionless stars of the
tails will continue orbiting between their inner and outer turning points, the
observations show the HI gas of the tails disappearing upon its return. We
discuss this result in light of the lack of central HI in the main body of this
merger remnant.

stellar disk is steeper than exponential and displays twisted and deformed
isophotes. Dust is not responsible for these deviations. The investigation of a
number of morphological models showed that M94 has a weak central stellar bar
of 0.7 kpc major axis length which comprises about 14 per cent of the total
light within 20 arcsec. By means of longslit spectroscopy the kinematics of gas
and stars in this region were investigated. The stellar kinematics reveal the
existence of a small spheroidal bulge with v/sigma of about 0.8. The stellar
velocity field in this region is approximately axisymmetric, showing that the
effects of the bar on the kinematics of the hot component are relatively small.
The warm gas in the bar region shows global and local deviations from the
stellar kinematics, but outside the central bar fits into the general HI
velocity field. Model calculations of closed orbits for gas in the potential of
the bar perturbation and axisymmetric disk and bulge predict large non-circular
motions for cold gas in equilibrium flow. These do not fit the central H_alpha
kinematics; rather it appears that the H_alpha gas must have large random
motions and is not in a steady state, and that hydrodynamical effects due to a
recent starburst play a role in the central region.

elementary embeddings from the collection of sets of rank less than lambda to
itself, as well as related finite left-distributive algebras (which can be
defined without reference to large cardinals). In particular, we look at the
critical points (least ordinals moved) of the elementary embeddings; simple
statements about these ordinals can be reformulated as purely algebraic
statements concerning the left distributive law. Previously, lower bounds on
the number of critical points have been used to show that certain such
algebraic statements, known to follow from large cardinals, require more than
Primitive Recursive Arithmetic to prove. Here we present the first few steps of
a program that, if it can be carried to completion, should give exact
computations of the number of critical points, thereby showing that hypotheses
only slightly beyond Primitive Recursive Arithmetic would suffice to prove the
aforementioned algebraic statements.
  Some of the main results here were discovered through examination of bit
patterns from extensive calculations in the finite algebras; this may be the
first serious example of computer-aided research in the theory of large

solenoid). We present a pragmatic approach to the problem based on the
orthogonalization of the radial solutions for different quantum numbers. Then
we discuss a model of a scalar particle with a magnetic moment which allows to
explain why the self-adjoint extension contains arbitrary parameters and give a
physical interpretation.
