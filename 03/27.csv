Picard curves of genus four with a $\sqrt{-3}$-level structure, six points on
the projective line, abelian surfaces with (1,3) polarisations, quartic

that this process cannot be the predominant source of primordial $^2$H since it
would result in anomalously high $^3$He/D ratios in conflict with standard
chemical evolution assumptions. We apply this fact to constrain topological
defect models of highest energy cosmic ray (HECR) production. Such models have
been proposed as possible sources of ultrahigh energy particles and gamma-rays
with energies above $10^{20}$eV. The constraints on these models derived from
$^4$He-photodisintegration are compared to corresponding limits from spectral
distortions of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) and from the
observed diffuse gamma-ray background. It is shown that for reasonable primary
particle injection spectra superconducting cosmic strings, unlike ordinary
strings or annihilating monopoles, cannot produce the HECR flux at the present
epoch without violating at least the $^4$He-photodisintegration bound. The
constraint from the diffuse gamma-ray background rules out the dominant
production of HECR by the decay of Grand Unification particles in models with
cosmological evolution assuming standard fragmentation functions. Constraints
on massive black hole induced photodisintegration are also discussed.

weaker distortions, however, can observationally be detected by a statistical
analysis of the numerous faint galaxy images, as first demonstrated by Tyson,
Valdes \& Wenk. This distortion effect can be used as a {\it quantitativetool}
for the reconstruction of the surface mass density of galaxy clusters with
appropriate redshifts, as was demonstrated by Kaiser \&Squires. They have
derived an explicit equation for this surface mass density in terms of its

due to the nature of the inversion formula, it produces boundary artefacts (or
biases) if applied to real data which are confined to a finite field on the

exact for ideal data on a finite data field (CCD). We demonstrate that there

determination of the subsurface compositional structure of white dwarf stars.
The hot DO PG 1159 has a helium surface layer with a mass of 0.001 Msun, while
the cooler DB white dwarf GD 358 has a much thinner surface helium layer of
10^-6 Msun. These results imply that either there is no evolutionary relation
between these two stars, or that there is an unknown mass loss mechanism. To
investigate possible evolutionary links between these objects, we computed
evolutionary sequences of white dwarf models including time-dependent
diffusion. Our initial model is based on the PG~1159 pulsational data, and has
a surface composition of 30% helium, 35% carbon, and 35% oxygen. Below this is
a thin transition zone where the helium fraction falls to zero. As expected,
diffusion caused a separation of the elements; a thickening surface layer of
nearly pure helium overlays a deepening transition zone where the composition
returns to the original surface composition. When the model reached the
temperature range of GD~358 and the pulsating DB white dwarfs, this pure helium
surface layer was 3x10^-6 stellar masses deep. The resulting evolved model is
very similar to the model used by Bradley and Winget (1994) to match the
pulsation observations of GD 358. The pulsation periods of this model also show
a good fit to the WET observations. These results demonstrate the plausibility
of a direct evolutionary path from PG 1159 stars to the much cooler DB white
dwarfs by inclusion of time-dependent diffusion. A problem still remains in
that our models have no hydrogen, and thus must retain their DB nature while
their surface tempeture drops from 45,000K to 30,000K. Since there are no known
DB stars in this range, we plan to address this problem in future calculations.

  Submitted to Phys Rev B",,,"MA/UC3M/2/1995","cond-mat",,"  We introduce a solvable model of a nonlinear double-barrier structure,
described by a generalized effective-mass equation with a nonlinear coupling
term. This model is interesting in its own right for possible new applications,
as well as to help understand the combined effect of spatial correlations and
nonlinearity on disordered systems. Although we specifically discuss the
application of the model to electron transport in semiconductor devices, our
results apply to other contexts, such as nonlinear optical phenomena. Our model
consists of finite width barriers and nonlinearities are dealt with separately
in the barriers and in the well, both with and without applied electric fields.
We study a wide range of nonlinearity coupling values. When the nonlinear term
is only present in the barriers, a sideband is observed in addition to the main
resonance and, as a consequence, the current-voltage characteristics present
two peaks at different voltages. In this case, the phenomenology remains
basically the same through all the considered variation of the parameters. When
the well is the component exhibiting nonlinearity, the results depend strongly
on the nonlinear coefficient. For small values, the current-voltage
characteristics exhibit lower and upper voltage cutoffs. This phenomenon is not
present at higher nonlinearities, and eventually linear-like behavior is
recovered. We complete this exhaustive study with an analysis of the effects of
having simultaneously both kinds of nonlinear couplings. We conclude the paper
with a summary of our results, their technological implications, and a
prospective discussion of the consequences of our work for more complex
systems.

chiral symmetry breaking, massless composites (glueballs, exotics, monopoles

magnetic quarks and gluons. Our analysis sheds new light on a recently found
duality in $N=1$ supersymmetric theories. The dual forms of some of the
theories exhibit ``quantum symmetries'' which involve non-local transformations
on the fields. We find that in some cases the duality has both $S$ and $T$
transformations generating $SL(2,Z)$ (only an $S_3$ quotient of which is
realized non-trivially). They map the original non-Abelian electric theory to
magnetic and dyonic non-Abelian theories. The magnetic theory gives a weak
coupling description of confinement while the dyonic theory gives a weak
coupling description of oblique confinement. Our analysis also shows that the
duality in $N=1$ is a generalization of the Montonen-Olive duality of $N=4$
theories.
