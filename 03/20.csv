is given with a special emphasis on the distinction between observational facts
and theoretical hypotheses. A classification of modern cosmological theories
and possible observational tests for these theories is presented. The main
rival cosmological models are analyzed from the point of view of observational
testing of their initial hypothesis. A comparison of modern observational data
with theoretical predictions is presented. In particular we discuss in detail
the validity of the two basic assumptions of modern cosmology that are the
Cosmological Principle and the Expanding Space Paradigm. It is found that
classical paradigms need to be reanalyzed and that it is necessary to develop
crucial cosmological tests to discriminate alternative theories.

to be a successful tool to render the quantum mechanical formalism on a steady
operationalistic background. The algebraic approach to general relativity first
proposed by Geroch is used to build a smearing procedure for events in the
quantized theory of spacetime. It stems from the notion of basic algebra which
possesses both the differential structure (as functional algebras) and
non-commutativity (as algebras of observables in quantum theories). The main
essence of this formalism is that it deprives the notion of spacetime as event
support of its fundamental status making it relative to the measurement
performed. Before the observation is executed, it is pointless to speak of
events as points of spacetime: there is no underlying manifold. Only when an
eigen-subalgebra of the basic algebra is outlined as eigenstate of the
observable, it gives rise to its functional representation on the appropriate
set thought of as spacetime.

description of the hadronic event properties, and necessary for a proper

non-perturbative parts of the parton distribution functions of the photon are
identified with the low-mass contributions to the dispersion integral. Their
normalizations, as well as the value of the scale $Q_0$ at which the
perturbative parts vanish, are fixed by approximating the low-mass
contributions by a discrete, finite sum of vector mesons. The shapes of these
hadronic distributions are fitted to the available data on $F_2^\gamma(x,Q^2)$.

we rely on the work of Shifman and Vainshtein relating the $\bt$-function of
the gauge coupling to the anomalous dimensions of the matter fields. Finite N=1
models, which have marginal operators at zero coupling, are easily identified
using our approach. The method can also be employed to find manifolds of fixed
points which do not include the free theory; these are seen in certain models
with product gauge groups and in many non-renormalizable effective theories.
For a number of our models, S-duality may have interesting implications. Using
the fact that relevant perturbations often cause one manifold of fixed points
to flow to another, we propose a specific mechanism through which the N=1
duality discovered by Seiberg could be associated with the duality of finite
N=2 models.

theory. For the three-charged-particle Green function that occurs in the exact
expression for the optical potential, a recently derived expression, which is
appropriate for the asymptotic region under consideration, is used. We find
that for arbitrary values of the energy parameter the non-static part of the
optical potential behaves for $\Delta_{\alpha} \rightarrow 0$ as
$C_{1}\Delta_{\alpha} + o\,(\Delta_{\alpha})$. From this we derive for the
Fourier transform of its on-shell restriction for $\rho_{\alpha} \rightarrow
\infty$ the behavior $-a/2\rho_{\alpha}^4 + o\,(1/\rho_{\alpha}^4)$, i.e.,
dipole or quadrupole terms do not occur in the coordinate-space asymptotics.
This result corroborates the standard one, which is obtained by perturbative
methods. The general, energy-dependent expression for the dynamic
polarisability $C_{1}$ is derived; on the energy shell it reduces to the
conventional polarisability $a$ which is independent of the energy. We
emphasize that the present derivation is {\em non-perturbative}, i.e., it does
not make use of adiabatic or similar approximations, and is valid for energies
{\em below as well as above the three-body dissociation threshold}.
