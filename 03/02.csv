agents trying to gain access to limited resources in an unpredictable
environment. Agents in these system continuously switch strategies in order to
opportunistically find improvements in their utilities. We have analyzed the
fluctuations around equilibrium that arise from strategy switching and
discovered the existence of a new phenomenon. It consists of the appearance of
sudden bursts of activity that punctuate the fixed point, and is due to an
effective random walk consistent with overall stability. This clustered
volatility is followed by relaxation to the fixed point but with different
strategy mixes from the previous one. This phenomenon is quite general for
systems in which agents explore strategies in search of local improvements.

on parabolic orbits, in order to quantify the effect of dynamical friction. The
effects of varying the ratio of the dark matter halo size to the distance of
closest approach were explored. Once the dark matter halos are fully
overlapping, the more massive simulated galaxies achieve a larger maximum
separation after the first encounter despite the increased dynamical friction
caused by the more extended halos. Projected separation and radial velocity
histograms were generated by ""observing"" the simulation results at various
times and from various orientations. These histograms were compared with
observations of galaxy pairs (Charlton & Salpeter 1991; Chengalur, Salpeter, &
Terzian 1993) with the result that large halo radii (~200 - 600 kpc) and wide
distances of closest approach are generally favored. It is difficult to
reconcile the small radial velocity differences that have been observed (median
of ~ 30 km/s, Chengalur et al. 1993) with the simulations when we sample all
parts of the orbits equally. Including an additional population of wide pairs
that have just recently reached ""turnabout"" from the Hubble flow would lower
the median velocity differences. Models suggest that additional data for pairs
at intermediate separations should have a somewhat larger median velocity
difference than the wide pairs. Very narrow pairs include galaxies which are
interacting, and whose gaseous components respond to forces other than gravity.
If consistently small $\Delta v$ are measured from neutral hydrogen velocities
in a larger sample of narrow pairs, pressure forces and dissipation effects on
the gaseous components could be responsible.

$\propto i{\bf d}\times {\bf d}^{\ast}$. In the presence of layer tunneling,
the (331) state ({\bf d} real) is unstable against other states with a

spin density wave formalism for the Hubbard model, and study diagrammatically
the profile of the two-magnon scattering and its intensity dependence on the
incoming photon frequency $\omega_i$ both for $\omega_i \ll U$ and in the
resonant regime, in which the energy of the incident photon is close to the gap
between conduction and valence bands. In the nonresonant case, we identify the
diagrams which contribute to the conventional Loudon-Fleury Hamiltonian. In the
resonant regime, where most of the experiments have been done, we find that the
dominant contribution to Raman intensity comes from a different diagram, one
which allows for a simultaneous vanishing of all three of its denominators
(i.e., a triple resonance). We study this diagram in detail and show that the
triple resonance, combined with the spin-density-wave dispersion relation for
the carriers, explains the unusual features found in the two-magnon profile and
in the two-magnon peak intensity dependence on the incoming photon frequency.
In particular, our theory predicts a maximum of the two-magnon peak intensity
right at the upper edge of the features in the optical data, which has been one
of the key experimental puzzles.

non-perturbative subtractions. A lattice computation of $\xi^{(1)}(1)$ with
this method is therefore feasible in principle. The one-loop renormalization
constants of the effective theory for slow heavy quarks are computed to order
$v^2$ together with the lattice-continuum renormalization constant of
$\xi^{(1)}(1)$ . We demonstrate that the expansion in the heavy-quark velocity
reproduces correctly the infrared structure of the original (non-expanded)
theory to every order. We compute also the one-loop renormalization constants
of the slow heavy quark effective theory to higher orders in $v^2$ and the
lattice-continuum renormalization constants of the higher derivatives of the
$\xi$ function. Unfortunately, the renormalization constants of the higher
derivatives are affected by ultraviolet power divergences, implying the
necessity of numerical non-perturbative subtractions. The lattice computation
of higher derivatives of the Isgur-Wise function seems therefore problematic.

responsible for producing the $W$ and $Z$ masses. Here we argue that isospin
breaking gauge interactions, which are necessary in order to split the top and
bottom quark masses, are likely to couple to technifermions. In this case they
produce a significant shift in the $W$ and $Z$ masses (i.e.~contribute to
$\Delta \rho_* = \alpha T$) if the scale of the new interactions is near 1 TeV.
In order to satisfy experimental constraints on $\Delta \rho_*$, we find that
either the effective top quark coupling or the top-color coupling must be
adjusted to 1\%. Independent of the couplings of the technifermions, we show
that the isospin-splitting of the top and bottom quarks implies that the
top-color gauge bosons must have masses larger than about 1.4 TeV. Our analysis
can also be applied to strong extended technicolor (ETC) models that produce
the top-bottom splitting via isospin breaking ETC interactions.

possibilities beyond the Standard Model (SM) already studied in many contexts.
We here address some further aspects. We first collect and update the
constraints from present data on their masses and mixings with conventional
quarks. We discuss possible effects on $b\to s\gamma$ and $Z\to b\bar b$ decays
and give fresh illustrations of CP asymmetries in $B^0$ decays differing
dramatically from SM expectations. We analyse singlet effects in grand
unification scenarios: $d$-type singlets are most economically introduced in
${\bf 5+5^*}$ multiplets of $SU(5)$, with up to three generations, preserving
gauge coupling unification with perturbative values up to the GUT scale;
$u$-type singlets can arise in ${\bf 10+10^*}$ multiplets of $SU(5)$ with at
most one light generation. With extra matter multiplets the gauge couplings are
bigger; we give the two-loop evolution equations including exotic multiplets
and a possible extra $U(1)$ symmetry. Two-loop effects can become important,
threatening unification (modulo threshold effects), perturbativity and
asymptotic freedom of $\alpha_3$. In the Yukawa sector, top-quark fixed-point
behaviour is preserved and singlet-quark couplings have infrared fixed points
too, but unification of $b$ and $\tau$ couplings is not possible in a
three-generation $E_6$ model.

antisymmetric otherwise serious controversies arise like violation of both
hermiticity and the Leibniz rule of differentiation.

forward--backward path integral representation for a density matrix of a
quantum system in a thermal oscillator bath. We exhibit the mechanism by which
the classical, $c$-valued noise in the Feynman-Vernon theory turns into an
operator-valued quantum noise fulfilling characteristic commutation relation
necessary for the unitarity of the time evolution in the quantum Langevin
equation.
