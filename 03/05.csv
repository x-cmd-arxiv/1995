density $\Omega_0$, and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. To focus the
discussion, I concentrate on the issue of the value of the density $\Omega_0$
in currently popular cosmological models in which most of the dark matter is
cold, especially Cold + Hot Dark Matter (CHDM) and flat low- $\Omega$ CDM with
a Cosmological Constant ($\Lambda$CDM). The evidence would favor a small
$\Omega_0 \approx 0.3$ if (1) the Hubble parameter actually has the high value
$h \approx 0.8$ favored by many observers, and the age of the universe $t_0
\geq 13$ Gy; or (2) the baryonic/total mass ratio in clusters is actually $\sim
20$\%, about 3-4 times larger than expected for standard Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis in an $\Omega=1$ universe, and standard BBN is actually right
in predicting that the density of ordinary matter $\Omega_b$ lies in the range
$0.009 \leq \Omega_b h^2 \leq 0.02$. The evidence would favor $\Omega=1$ if (1)
the POTENT analysis of galaxy peculiar velocity data is right, in particular
regarding outflows from voids or the inability to obtain the present-epoch
non-Gaussian density distribution from Gaussian initial fluctuations in a
low-$\Omega$ universe; or (2) the preliminary report from LSND indicating a
neutrino mass $\geq 2.4$ eV is right, since that would be too much hot dark
matter to allow significant structure formation in a low-$\Omega$ $\Lambda$CDM
model. Statistics on gravitational lensing of quasars provide a strong upper
limit on $\Lambda$. Reliable data on all of these issues is becoming available
so rapidly today that a clear decision between these alternatives may be
possible within the next few years.

is analyzed in the Landau theory of phase transitions. Wide range of possible
coexistence of the FCC phase with SC one in C60 has been found from 260 K down
to critical temperature 160 K of the instability of high-symmetry phase. The
specific heat, thermal expansion coefficient and isothermal compressibility for

deuterium and hydrogen are sensitive to these violations, and that the pion and
nucleon charge symmetry violating terms separate as a function of $x_\pi$ and

wavelet basis functions and their multiscale localization properties provide a
new approach to the statistical analysis and analytical control of

several discrete models shows that the wavelet transformation supresses
redundancy in the correlation information. Wavelet correlations can be
naturally interpreted as correlations between structures (clumps) living on
different scales.

infrared divergences complicate factorization. Here we prove that factorization
in such theories is described by a set of universal functions. In particular, a
proof of the universality of one-loop splitting functions as the momenta of two
particles become collinear is presented. Factorization in multi-particle
channels is also given. The discontinuity functions that appear in the
splitting functions may also be used to obtain infrared divergent box integral
functions from finite ones.

reparametrization invariance of the first-order Lagrangian have been exploited
for the BRST quantization of this system on a $GL_{q}(2)$ invariant quantum
world-line. The on-shell equivalence of these BRST charges requires the
deformation parameter to be $ \pm 1 $ under certain identifications.The same
restriction ($ q= \pm 1 $) emerges from the conservation of the $q$-deformed
BRST charge on an arbitrary (unconstrained) manifold and the validity of the
BRST algebra. The solutions for the equations of motion respect $GL_{q}(2)$
invariance on the mass-shell at any arbitrary value of the evolution parameter
