of higher curvature theories where the Lagrangian consists of a polynomial in
the Ricci scalar, we use a conformally equivalent theory to establish that
stationary black hole solutions with a Killing horizon satisfy the Zeroth Law,
and that the Second Law holds in general for any dynamical process. We also
introduce a new method for establishing the Second Law based on a
generalization of the area theorem, which may prove useful for a wider class of
Lagrangians. Finally, we show how one can infer the form of the black hole
entropy, at least for the Ricci polynomial theories, by integrating the changes
of mass and angular momentum in a quasistationary accretion process.

with curvature of order the Hubble constant. This has a dramatic effect on the
coherent production of scalar fields along flat directions. For the moduli
problem it generically gives a concrete realization of the problem by
determining the field value subsequent to inflation. However it might suggest a
solution if the minimum of the induced potential coincides with the true
minimum. The induced Hubble scale mass also has important implications for the
Affleck-Dine mechanism of baryogenesis. This mechanism requires large squark or
slepton expectation values to develop along flat directions in the early
universe. This is generally not the case if the induced mass squared is
positive, but does occur if it is negative. The resulting baryon to entropy
ratio depends mainly on the dimension of the nonrenormalizable operator in the
superpotential which stabilizes the flat direction, and the reheat temperature
after inflation. Unlike the original scenario, it is possible to obtain an
acceptable baryon asymmetry without subsequent entropy releases.

generalized to static Green's functions of composite operators that contain
fermionic fields. The recognition of a natural kinematic region where the
lowest Matsubara modes are close to their mass-shell, and the ultraviolet
behavior of the running coupling constant of the original theory are crucial
for providing the necessary scale hierarchy. The general strategy is
illustrated in the asymptotically-free Gross-Neveu model in 1+1 dimensions,
where we verify that dimensional reduction occurs to the leading order in
$g^2(T)$. We also find, in the same model, that the scale parameter
characterizing the dependence on temperature of the coupling constant in the
reduced theory, $\Lambda_T$, is considerably smaller than
$\Lambda_{\bar{\text{MS}}}$. Implications of our results for QCD are also
discussed.

two-dimensional Minkowski space have an infinite-dimensional algebra of hidden
symmetries. Because of the relevance of symmetric space models to duality
symmetries in string theory, the hidden symmetries of these models are explored
in some detail. The string theory application requires including coupling to
gravity, supersymmetrization, and quantum effects. However, as a first step,
this paper only considers classical bosonic theories in flat space-time. Even
though the algebra of hidden symmetries of principal chiral models is confirmed
to include a Kac--Moody algebra (or a current algebra on a circle), it is
argued that a better interpretation is provided by a doubled current algebra on
a semi-circle (or line segment). Neither the circle nor the semi-circle bears
any apparent relationship to the physical space. For symmetric space models the
line segment viewpoint is shown to be essential, and special boundary
conditions need to be imposed at the ends. The algebra of hidden symmetries
also includes Virasoro-like generators. For both principal chiral models and
symmetric space models, the hidden symmetry stress tensor is singular at the
ends of the line segment.
