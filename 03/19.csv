corrections similar to the ones which occur in the free energy of a simple
critical system : the massless Gaussian field. Here, the Coulomb system is
assumed to be confined by walls made of an ideal conductor material; this
choice corresponds to simple (Dirichlet) boundary conditions for the Gaussian
field. For a $d$-dimensional ($d>or=2$) Coulomb system confined in a slab of
thickness $W$, the grand potential (in units of $kT$) per unit area has the
universal term $Gamma(d/2) zeta(d)/2^d pi^{d/2}W^{d-1}$. For a two-dimensional
Coulomb system confined in a disk of radius $R$, the grand potential (in units
of $kT$) has the universal term $(1/6) ln R$. These results, of general
validity, are checked on two-dimensional solvable models.

existence of screening) taken for granted, one can deduce universal properties
for the thermal fluctuations in a classical Coulomb system at equilibrium. The
universality is especially apparent in the long-range correlations of the
electrical potentials and fields. The charge fluctuations are derived from the
field fluctuations. This is a convenient way for studying the surface charge
fluctuations on a conductor with boundaries. Explicit results are given for
simple geometries. The potentials and the fields have Gaussian fluctuations,
except for a short-distance cutoff.

directions of SUSY vacua. We show that under general assumptions all gauge
nonsinglet fields, parameterizing flat directions (and in particular squarks
and sleptons), get large $radiative$ masses which are related to the value of
the Hubble constant ($H$) and to the expectation value of the inflaton field.
This mass (typically $\sim H$) is of ``non-gravitational'' origin and does not
vanishes in the global SUSY limit. Large radiative corrections are induced by
$F$-term (or $D$-term) density, which dominates the inflationary universe and
strongly breaks supersymmetry. In such theories it is difficult to treat
squarks and sleptons as the light fields in the inflationary period. In the
generic supergravity theories all flat directions, including moduli, are
getting curvature of order the Hubble constant. However, for the
gauge-nonsinglet flat directions radiative contribution to the curvature
(induced by renormalizable gauge interactions) may be dominant.

for non--conserved currents to the case of three boson vertices. We outline in
detail how effective gauge invariant three boson vertices can be constructed,
with all three incoming momenta {\it off--shell}. Explicit closed expressions
for the vertices $\gamma W^- W^+$, $Z W^- W^+$, and $\chi W^- W^+$ are
reported. The three boson vertices so constructed satisfy naive QED--like Ward
identities which relate them to the gauge invariant gauge boson self--energies
previously constructed by the same method. The derivation of the aforementioned
Ward identities relies on the sole requirement of complete gauge invariance of
the S--matrix element considered; in particular, no knowledge of the explicit
closed form of the three boson vertices involved is necessary.The validity of
one of these Ward identities is demonstrated explicitly, through a detailed
diagrammatic one-loop analysis, in the context of three different gauges.

talk, I report on the spacetime quantization of the BPFTW effective action for
quarks in a hot environ. The fermion propagator is known to give a
pseudo-Lorentz invariant particle pole as well as new spacelike cuts. Our
quantization shows that the spacelike cuts directly lead to a thermal vacuum
that is a generalized NJL state, with a curious $90^{o}$ phase. This $90^{o}$
is responsible for < \psibarpsi > vanishing at high $T$. The thermal vacuum is
invariant under a new chiral charge, but continues to break the old zero
temperature chirality. Our quantization suggests a new class of order
parameters that probe the physics of these spacelike cuts. In usual scenario,
the pion dissociates in the early alphabet soup. With this new understanding of
the thermal vacuum, the pion remains a Nambu-Goldstone particle at high $T$,
and will not dissociate. It propagates at the speed of light but with a halo.
