amplitudes and fluxes in a horizontally homogeneous, two-layer model on an

U/(beta*lambda^2), where lambda is the deformation radius and U is the mean
thermal wind, the result for the RMS eddy velocity V, the characteristic
wavenumber of the energy-containing eddies and of the eddy-driven jets k, and
the magnitude of the eddy diffusivity for potential vorticity D, in the limit
x>>1, are as follows: V/U ~ x ; k*lambda ~ 1/x ; D/(U*lambda) ~ x^2. Numerical
simulations provide qualitative support for this scaling, but suggest that it
underestimates the sensitivity of these eddy statistics to the value of x. A
generalization that is applicable to continuous stratification is suggested
which leads to the estimates: V ~ 1/(beta T^2); k ~ beta*T; D ~
1/{[beta^2][T^3]} where T is a time-scale determined by the environment; in
particular, it equals lambda/U in the two-layer model and N/(fS) in a
continuous flow with uniform shear S and stratification N. This same scaling
has also been suggested as relevant to a continuously stratified fluid in the
opposite limit, x<<1 (Held, 1980). Therefore, we suggest that it may be of
general relevance in planetary atmospheres and in the oceans.

  available by anonymous ftp from ftp://brmha.mit.edu/ To be published in ApJ.",,"10.1086/176055",,"astro-ph",,"  We consider the tidal excitation of modes in a binary system of arbitrary
eccentricity. For a circular orbit, the modes generally undergo forced
oscillation with a period equal to the orbital period ($T$). For an eccentric
orbit, the amplitude of each tidally excited mode can be written approximately
as the sum of an oscillatory term that varies sinusoidally with the mode
frequency and a `static' term that follows the time dependence of the tidal
forcing function. The oscillatory term falls off exponentially with increasing
$\b$ (defined as the ratio of the periastron passage time to the mode period),
whereas the `static' term is independent of $\b$. For small $\b$ modes ($\b
\approx 1$), the two terms are comparable, and the magnitude of the mode
amplitude is nearly constant over the orbit. For large $\b$ modes ($\b \gta$ a
few), the oscillatory term is very small compared to the `static' term, in
which case the mode amplitude, like the tidal force, varies as the distance
cubed. For main sequence stars, $p$, $f$, and low order $g$-modes generally
have large $\b$ and hence small amplitudes of oscillation. High overtone
$g$-modes, however, have small overlap with the tidal forcing function. Thus,
we expect an intermediate overtone $g$-mode with $\b \sim 1$ to have the
largest oscillation amplitude. The dependence on mode damping and the stellar
rotation rate is considered, as well as the effects of orbital evolution. We
apply our work to the two binary pulsar system: PSR J0045-7319 and PSR

the observations of all dwarfs are in compelling agreement with the predictions

expected if MOND is a valid alternative to dark matter. His sole cause for
complaint was that some of his MOND M/L values were still outside the range of
``reasonable'' stellar values. This, we say, was easily attributable to
uncertainties in the data, such as in the velocity dispersions, luminosities,
core radii, etc., and in the assumptions that underlie the analysis, such as
isotropic velocity distribution, light-distribution fits, etc.. There are now
new, much improved determinations of the velocity dispersions for three of the
dwarfs, in particular for the two dwarfs for which Gerhard found high MOND M/L
values. In fact, within just the quoted errors on the velocity dispersions and
the luminosities, the MOND M/L values for all seven dwarfs are now perfectly
consistent with stellar values, with no need for dark matter.

constants is introduced to model the quenched disorder. The effect of the
disorder on the scaling of the structure factor and on the domain growth is
investigated in both the zero temperature limit and at finite temperature. In
particular, we find that at zero temperature the domain size, $R(t)$, scales
with the amplitude, $A$, of the quenched disorder as $R(t) = A^{-\beta}
f(t/A^{-\gamma})$ with $\beta \simeq 1.0$ and $\gamma \simeq 3.0$ in two

We discuss these results in the context of Monte Carlo and cell dynamical

This has been motivated a $\nu_\mu$-$\nu_{\tau}$ oscillation explanation of the

$nu_\mu$ to $\nu_e$ has an alternative explanation, the cosmological model can
be retained if the deficit of solar neutrinos is explained by
$\nu_e$-$\nu_{\tau}$ oscillation. In this case an inverted mass hierarchy is
required with $m_{\nu_{\mu}}\ll m_{\nu_e} \simeq m_{\nu_\tau}\approx 2.4$ eV.
