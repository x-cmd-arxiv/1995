events with charm, bottom, and light- flavour fragmentation in their
charged-hadron sample. We treat all partons independently and to properly
incorporate the charm and bottom thresholds. Due to the sizeable energy gap
between PEP and LEP, we are sensitive to the scaling violation in the
fragmentation process, which allows us to extract a value for the asymptotic
scale parameter of QCD, $\Lambda$. Recent data on inclusive charged-hadron
production in tagged three-jet events by OPAL and similar data for longitudinal
electron polarization by ALEPH allow us to pin down the gluon fragmentation
functions. Our new fragmentation functions lead to an excellent description of
a multitude of other $e^+e^-$ data on inclusive charged-hadron production,
ranging from $\sqrt s=5.2$~GeV to LEP energy. In addition, they agree nicely
with the transverse-momentum spectra of single charged hadrons measured by H1
and ZEUS in photoproduction at the $ep$ collider HERA, which represents a
nontrivial check of the factorization theorem of the QCD-improved parton model.
