images of cosmologically distant, faint galaxies due to gravitational lensing
by foreground galaxies. A mean image polarisation of $<p>=0.011\pm 0.006$ is
measured for 3202 pairs of source galaxies with magnitudes $23< r \le 24$ and
lens galaxies with magnitudes $20\le r\le 23$. The signal remains strong for
lens-source separations $\lo 90''$, consistent with quasi-isothermal galaxy
halos extending to large radii ($\go 100h^{-1}$ kpc). Our observations thus
provide the first evidence from weak gravitational lensing of large scale dark
halos associated with individual galaxies. The observed polarisation is also
consistent with the signal expected on the basis of simulations incorporating
measured properties of local galaxies and modest extrapolations of the observed
redshift distribution of faint galaxies. From the simulations we derive a
best-fit halo circular velocity of $V\sim 220$ km/s and characteristic radial
extent of $s \go 100h^{-1}$ kpc. Our best-fit halo parameters imply typical
masses for the lens galaxies within a radius of $100h^{-1}$ kpc on the order of
$1.0^{+1.1}_{-0.7}\times 10^{12}h^{-1} M_\odot$, in good agreement with recent
dynamical estimates of the masses of local spiral galaxies. This is
particularly encouraging as the lensing and dynamical mass estimators rely on
different sets of assumptions. Contamination of the gravitational lensing
signal by a population of tidally distorted satellite galaxies can be ruled out
with reasonable confidence. The prospects for corroborating and improving this
measurement seem good, especially using deep HST archival data.

of the spontaneously broken {\em accidental} global symmetry $SU(6)\times U(6)$

leading to the consistent picture of the quark and lepton masses and mixing,
without invoking the horizontal symmetry or zero texture concepts. In
particular, the only particle that has direct $O(1)$ Yukawa coupling with the

follows as a consequence of gauge invariance and of the field content of the

for the dynamical generation of a hierarchical pattern of fermion masses,
without the need of any ad hoc choice of small Yukawa couplings. The structure
of the mass matrices implies that the fourth family does not mix with the other
three, and that the $b',t',\tau',\nu'$ masses are all naturally in the 100 GeV
range. The model has other interesting phenomenological implications. The scale
of the horizontal symmetry breaking is constrained by cosmological and
astrophysical arguments to be $\sim 10^{11}$ GeV. Then the late $b'$ decays
could explain a magnitude of the isotropic cosmic gamma flux. In addition, a
lower bound of a few eV is found for the mass of the $\tau$-neutrino, which can
thus provide a hot component for the cosmological dark matter. Due to R parity
conservation, the lightest supersymmetric particle is stable and can provide
the cold component. The $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ masses can naturally be in the
correct ranges for a solution of the solar or atmospheric neutrino problems via

to study coherent two-photon processes. Considering realistic design
luminosities for the different ion beams, we find that beams of light-to-medium
size ions like calcium will give the highest production rates. With a suitable
trigger and assuming a b-quark identification efficiency of $30\%$ and a
$b{\bar b}$ mass resolution of 10 GeV one could expect to see a Higgs signal in
the $b{\bar b}$ channel with a 3-4 $\sigma$ statistical significance in the
first phase of operation of the LHC with beams of calcium.

electroweak rescattering, are very small. Thus these measurements are
potentially sensitive to physics beyond the standard model. We investigate one
such contribution which involves a new gauge boson coupling to baryon number.

Taking into account the multi-gluon exchange in the law $Q^2$ regions, we
suggest that the running coupling constant should be frozen at
$\alpha_s(t=\sqrt{<{\bf k}_{T}^{2}>})$ and $\sqrt{<{\bf k}_{T}^{2}>}$ is the
average transverse momentum which can be determined by the pionic wave
function. In addition, we correct the previous calculations about the Sudakov
suppression factor which plays an important role in the perturbative
predictions for the pion form factor.

potential in supersymmetric theories, are natural candidates to act as
inflatons. An inflationary potential on moduli space can result if the scale of
dynamical SUSY breaking in some sector of the theory is determined by a moduli
dependent coupling. The magnitude of density fluctuations generated during
inflation then depends on the scale of SUSY breaking in this sector. This can
naturally be hierarchically smaller than the Planck scale in a dynamical model,
giving small fluctuations without any fine tuning of parameters. It is also
natural for SUSY to be restored at the minimum of the moduli potential, and to
leave the universe with zero cosmological constant after inflation. Acceptable
reheating can also be achieved in this scenario.

Moduli are

amplitude of microwave background fluctuations constrains the dynamics
responsible for inflation to take place at a higher scale than supersymmetry
breaking. Models explaining this difference in scales and also preventing the
dilaton from running to infinity are proposed. The problem of dilaton
domination of the energy density of the universe is not resolved.

effects, and of the network of exact solutions in supersymmetry. However, there
