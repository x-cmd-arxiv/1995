Stefan Bauer proved directly via algebraic geometry that the stable bundles

  We show, via a short proof in differential geometry, a generalisation to

consider the pulling back of smooth parabolic bundles via $q$.

a major outburst at all frequencies higher than a few GHz, which peaked a few
months after a strong outburst in high energy $\gamma$-rays and showed the
canonical time evolution of a cooling and/or expanding electron distribution.
Our data indicate that the outburst in the EGRET range originated very close to
the central object of the AGN and that a remnant of this outburst moved further
outward in the jet until it became optically thin at radio frequencies after a
few months. During the flare in July 1993 we observed with the Effelsberg 100-m

These arise in theories, including the standard electroweak model, that include
charged vector mesons with mass $m\ne 0$. In such theories, a magnetically
charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole with horizon radius less than a critical
value of the order of $m^{-1}$ is classically unstable against the development
of a nonzero vector meson field just outside the horizon, indicating the
existence of static black hole solutions with vector meson hair. For the case
of unit magnetic charge, spherically symmetric solutions of this type have
previously been studied. For other values of the magnetic charge, general
arguments show that any new solution with hair cannot be spherically symmetric.
In this paper we develop and apply a perturbative scheme (which may have
applicability in other contexts) for constructing such solutions in the case
where the Reissner-Nordstrom solution is just barely unstable. For a few low
values of the magnetic charge the black holes retain a rotational symmetry
about a single axis, but this axial symmetry disappears for higher charges.
While the vector meson fields vanish exponentially fast at distances greater
than $O(m^{-1})$, the magnetic field and the metric have higher multipole
components that decrease only as powers of the distance from the black hole.

whose chiral algebras, when maximally extended, are isomorphic to the current
algebra formed from some affine non-twisted Kac--Moody algebra at fixed level.
In this case the partition function is specified by an automorphism of the
fusion ring and corresponding symmetry of the Kac--Peterson modular matrices.
We classify all such partition functions when the underlying finite-dimensional
Lie algebra is simple. This gives all possible spectra for this class of RCFTs.
While accomplishing this, we also find the primary fields with second smallest
quantum dimension.

$X(d\rightarrow)$ according to a recent classification, is presented and shown
to contain only five generic types. In contrast to the case of $X(d\uparrow)$
(which contains as a subclass all possible FRW backgrounds), exact $SO(3)$
isotropy is always broken in the $X(d\rightarrow)$ class. This is due to the
$H$-field, whose dual is necessarily along a principal direction of anisotropy.
Nevertheless, FRW symmetry can be attained asymptotically for Bianchi-types $I$
and $VII_0$ in a rather appealing physical context. Other aspects of the
solutions found for types $X=I,II,III,VI_{-1}$, and of the $VII_0$ case are
briefly discussed.

define its generalized character to be the following function on the Cartan
subalgebra with values in $U$:
  $\chi_\Phi(h)=\Tr_V (\Phi e^h)$.
  These generalized characters are a rich source of special functions,
possessing many interesting properties; for example, they are common
eigenfunctions of a family of commuting differential (difference) operators. We
show that the special functions that can be obtained this way include
Macdonald's polynomials of type $A$, and this technique allows to prove inner
product and symmetry identities for these polynomials (though proved earlier by
other methods).
  Generalized characters for affine Lie algebras are closely related with
so-called correlation functions on the torus in the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW)
model of conformal field theory. We derive differential equations satisfied by
these correlation functions (elliptic Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov, or
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations) and study their monodromies.
