dimension is determined by the underlying differentiable manifold (Van de Ven
Conjecture). We use a set up that replaces generic metrics by the construction
of a localised Euler class of an infinite dimensional bundle with a Fredholm
section. This allows us to compute the Seiberg Witten invariants of all

multiplicities of the elliptic fibration are determined by the underlying
oriented manifold, and that the plurigenera of a surface are oriented

  (Contact brewer@geop.ubc.ca)",,"10.1086/117466",,"astro-ph",,"  We have imaged five 7\arcmin \x 7\arcmin\ fields in M31 spanning
galactocentric radii from 4 to 32 kpc along the SW-major axis. The fields were
observed through two broad-band (\V\ and \I) and two narrow-band (\CN\ and
\TiO) filters. The broad-band data were used to construct \IvsVI\
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and, in some of our fields, we found
significant numbers of stars in the Cepheid instability strip. A distance
modulus for the Cepheids in the middle field was found that agreed well with
other values in the literature values. The width of the giant branch (GB) in
the \IvsVI\ CMD of all 5 fields was investigated, and we show that in four of
the fields a likely explanation for the GB width is a combination of {\it both}
metallicity and mass variations. Using the broad-band data, the asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) luminosity functions (LFs) were measured in the five fields,
and we show that differences exist between these LFs. We speculate on how the
different star forming histories in the fields may lead to the observed AGB LFs
and GB widths. Using the narrow-band data along with the broad-band data we
separated the AGB stars into carbon-rich (C) and oxygen-rich (M) types. The
carbon stars LFs were used to obtain an estimate for the distance modulus of
M31 which agrees with the value derived from Cepheids. The ratio of C- to
M-stars (C/M) is believed to be an indicator of gaseous chemical abundance at
the time of formation of these stars. We show that the C/M ratio increases
smoothly with galactocentric distance, suggesting an inverse correlation with
metallicity. This is the first demonstration of this effect within a single
extragalactic system. We find that differences in the width of the GB and the
AGB LFs do not significantly affect the C/M ratio. We consider the effect of
the increasing C/M ratio on the ISM in M31, and cite evidence in favor of a
model where the grain composition in M31 is a function of galactocentric
distance.

operator be self adjoint is a key ingredient in constructing the physical
Hilbert space and has non-trivial cosmological implications since it is related
with the problem of time in quantum cosmology. Namely, if time is parametrized
by matter fields we find two types of domains for the self adjoint WDW
operator: a non trivial domain is comprised of zero current (Hartle-Hawking
type) wave functions and is parametrized by two new parameters, whereas the
domain of a self adjoint WDW operator acting on tunneling (Vilenkin type) wave
functions is a {\em single} ray. On the other hand, if time is parametrized by
the scale factor both types of wave functions give rise to non trivial domains
for the self adjoint WDW operators, and no new parameters appear in them.
