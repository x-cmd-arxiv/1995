evolutionary phases of spheroidal galaxies in the optical band, while the
corresponding dust re-radiation in the far-IR may have been, during the early
evolutionary phases, orders of magnitude larger than today. Hyperluminous IRAS
galaxies might be extreme examples of this situation. Additional indications
that at least some spheroidal galaxies may have been very dusty during their
early evolution are provided by recent data on high redshift radio galaxies and

the frozen-out topological defects is set by the competition between the quench
rate -- the rate at which the phase transition is taking place -- and the
relaxation rate of the order parameter. More specifically, the characteristic
domain size which determines the typical distance separating topological
defects in the new broken symmetry phase (and, therefore, their density) is
determined by the correlation length at the instant at which the relaxation
timescale of the order parameter is equal to the time from the phase
transition. This scenario shares with the Kibble mechanism the idea that
topological defects will appear ``in between'' domains with independently
chosen broken symmetry vacuum. However, it differs from the original proposal
in estimating the size of such domains through the non-equilibrium aspects of
the transition (quench rate), rather than through the Ginzburg temperature at
which thermally activated symmetry restoration can still occur in the
correlation - length sized volumes of the broken symmetry phase. This scenario
can be employed to analyze recent superfluid quench experiments carried out in
bulk He$^4$ to study the analogue of the ``cosmological'' prediction of
significant vortex line production. It can be also applied to superfluid
quenches in annular geometry, as well as to the rapid phase transition from the
normal metal to superconductor, where the symmetry breaking occurs in the order
parameter with the local (rather than a global) gauge. Cosmological
implications of the revised defect formation scenario with the critical domain
size set by the freeze-out time rather than by the Ginzburg temperature are

can be defined as an enhancement factor in the semiclassical decay rate, which
is dominated by a sphaleron-like saddle point. We find that all perturbative
divergences appearing in Euclidean calculations of the entropy can be
renormalized in low energy couplings. We also discuss some formal aspects of
the relation between the Euclidean and Hamiltonian approaches to the one loop
corrections to black hole entropy and geometric entropy, and we emphasize the
virtues of the use of covariant regularization prescriptions. In fact, the
definition of black hole entropy in terms of decay rates {\it requires} the use
of covariant measures and accordingly, covariant regularizations in path
integrals. Finally, we speculate on the possibility that low energy effective
field theory could be sufficient to understand the microscopic degrees of
freedom underlying black hole entropy. We propose a qualitative physical
picture in which black hole entropy refers to a space of quasi-coherent states
of infalling matter, together with its gravitational field. We stress that this
scenario might provide a low energy explanation of both the black hole entropy
and the information puzzle.

quasi-distribution function that can become negative. A generalization of
Malus' Law for arbitrary spin-s is obtained in the form of a Feynman
path-integral representation for the Malus amplitude. The classical limit of
the Malus amplitude for large s is discussed.

  Physica D.",,"10.1016/0167-2789(94)00271-Q",,"quant-ph",,"  We show that the rate of increase of von Neumann entropy computed from the
reduced density matrix of an open quantum system is an excellent indicator of
the dynamical behavior of its classical hamiltonian counterpart. In decohering
quantum analogs of systems which exhibit classical hamiltonian chaos entropy
production rate quickly tends to a constant which is given by the sum of the
positive Lyapunov exponents, and falls off only as the system approaches
equilibrium. By contrast, integrable systems tend to have entropy production
rate which decreases as $t^{-1}$ well before equilibrium is attained. Thus,
behavior of quantum systems in contact with the environment can be used as a
test to determine the nature of their hamiltonian evolution.
