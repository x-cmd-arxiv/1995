Two bursts of star formation, with the older burst rich in red supergiants. For
IB case, evolution of colors shows three distinct phases --- an initial steady
blue phase, followed by a red bump (5--15~Myr) and another steady phase with
colors intermediate to the earlier two phases. CSF colors asymptotically reach
peak values at $\sim 10$~Myr, never reaching the reddest IB colors. Ionizing
photon production rate falls off by an order of magnitude in 6~Myr for IB,
where as it almost remains constant for CSF model. Two-burst models with burst
separations $\sim 10$~Myr have properties of both IB and CSF, simultaneously
producing the red IB colors and high ionizing photon rate, making such regions
easily distinguishable using optical observations. Flat IMFs result in bluest
colors when the massive stars are on the main sequence and reddest colors
during the red supergiant phase of the evolving massive stars. Errors on the
computed quantities due to the statistical uncertainties inherent in the
process of star formation become negligible for cluster masses in excess of

  at the Manchester England, Jan 1995, Conference on Astrophysical Shocks",,"10.1007/BF00627350",,"astro-ph",,"  In this paper, by considering a simple fluid model, we investigate the role
of phase transitions in the ISM on the galaxy scale gas dynamics. Cooling and
heating timescales in the ISM are typically shorter than typical galactic
rotation timescales, so the individual phases in the ISM can be assumed to be
in temperature equilibrium with the radiation field. Using this approximation
we can construct an equation of state which depends upon the average density
and mass fractions in the individual phases. Previous studies suggest that
there is an equilibrium phase fraction as a function of pressure. We
incorporate evolution towards this equilibrium state as a relaxation term with
a time to obtain equilibrium $\tau$. We derive a condition in terms of a
critical Mach number when one dimensional shocks should be continuous. For
small values of the relaxation time $\tau$ we show that the relaxation term
acts like a viscosity. We show with one dimensional simulations that increasing
$\tau$ causes shocks to become smoother. This work suggests that phase changes
can strongly effect the gas dynamics of the ISM across spiral arms and bars.

relatively shallower UBVI photometry for the whole cluster ($23' \times 23'$).
The data have been used to discuss the reddening, metallicity and age
ofNGC~6791, a cluster which is particularly important because of (1)~its
most-advanced age among open clusters, (2)~metallicity higher than solar and
(3)~particularly large number of member stars. We discovered two new very blue
stars increasing the total of sdB objects in the cluster to ten. They are
located in a very narrow range magnitudes $V=17.7 \pm 0.5$; their blue colors
strongly constrain our determination of the reddening of the cluster to
$E(B-V)=0.17 \pm 0.01$. We detected no other blue stars except a population of
faint objects with $V \approx 22$ in the center of the cluster. We have used
the new theoretical isochrones in a differential determination of metallicity

abundaces and age. We find $[Fe/H] \simeq +0.5$ and age by 1~Gyr older than

The optical and infrared colors maps trace the location of the major dust
features. The dust lanes are relatively free of star formation and have low
opacity. The depth of the dust lanes decreases as a function of wavelength so
that they are deepest at $B$ and shallower at $H$ and $K$ where they are
difficult to detect. We find that the dust lane on the north-west side of the
galaxy has colors consistent with those of a dust screen with opacity derived
from the galactic extinction law. Thus, it must be located on the near side of
the galaxy. The colors in the dust lane on the south-east side of the galaxy,
on the other hand, suggest that there are stars both in front of and behind the
dust, consistent with this dust lane being located on the far side of the
galaxy. Near the inner spiral ring (at $\sim 17'' = 1.4$kpc from the nucleus),
the dust lane becomes double peaked with peak to valley extinction ratio
similar to that observed in radio continuum by Ondrechen and van der Hulst
(1983). This suggests that if the cold diffuse component of the interstellar
medium (traced by the dust) moves with the cosmic ray electron component then
the magnetic field pressure is not a significant force in the shocks.
Alternatively if the two phases do not move together a more detailed comparison
may show differences in the shock shapes. From the $K$ images, we estimate that
the total stellar mass of the star forming spiral ring at a radius of $\sim$
1kpc from the nucleus is of the same order as the molecular gas mass in the
ring. The infrared images show a short bar inside the inner spiral ring. In the
principal plane of the galaxy, the short bar is not perpendicular to the

non-chaotic model and obtain results which are similar to those reported for
apparently chaotic, {\em in vitro} neuronal networks. We also obtain similar
results when we apply chaos control to a simple stochastic system. These novel
findings challenge the claim that the aforementioned neuronal networks were
chaotic and suggest that chaos control techniques can be applied to a wider
range of experimental systems than previously thought.

three types of string fields which generalize the real superfield of the
super-Yang-Mills prepotential, and the chiral and anti-chiral superfields of
the Calabi-Yau scalar multiplet. The resulting field theory action for the open
superstring in a Calabi-Yau background has the advantages over the standard RNS

duality is here examined in a minimalist fashion at the strictly 4-dimensional,

star duality is found which, though not yet known to give dual symmetry,
reproduces analogues to many dual properties of the abelian theory. For
example, there is a dual potential, but it is a 2-indexed tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$
of the Freedman-Townsend type. Though not itself functioning as such,
$T_{\mu\nu}$ gives rise to a dual parallel transport, $\tilde{A}_\mu$, for the
phase of the wave function of the colour magnetic charge, this last being a
monopole of the Yang-Mills field but a source of the dual field. The standard
colour (electric) charge itself is found to be a monopole of $\tilde{A}_\mu$.
At the same time, the gauge symmetry is found doubled from say $SU(N)$ to
$SU(N) \times SU(N)$. A novel feature is that all equations of motion,
including the standard Yang-Mills and Wong equations, are here derived from a
`universal' principle, namely the Wu-Yang (1976) criterion for monopoles, where
interactions arise purely as a consequence of the topological definition of the
monopole charge. The technique used is the loop space formulation of Polyakov
(1980).

parameter, thermal pressure, Gruneisen parameter and their pressure and
temperature dependencies are studied in order to better understand high
pressure effects on thermal properties. The results agree very well with
experiments and show that the thermal expansivity decreases with pressure up to
about 100 GPa ($\eta$=0.73), and is almost pressure and temperature independent
above this compression. It is also effected by anharmonicity at zero pressure
and temperatures above 2500K. The thermal pressure changes very little with
increasing pressures and temperatures, and the Gruneisen parameter is
temperature independent and decreases slightly with pressure.

of a charged particle off a bound state of two other charged particles contain
the fully off-shell two-body Coulomb T-matrix describing the intermediate-state
Coulomb scattering of the projectile with each of the charged target particles.
Up to now the latter is usually replaced by the Coulomb potential, either when
using the multiple-scattering approach or when solving three-body integral
equations. General properties of the exact and the approximate on-shell driving
terms are discussed, and the accuracy of this approximation is investigated
numerically, both for atomic and nuclear processes including bound-state
excitation, for energies below and above the corresponding three-body
dissociation threshold, over the whole range of scattering angles.

  **** Edge transport and turbulence studies on U-3M
  The turbulent-driven particle flow is shown to be comparable with the
equilibrium flow at the boundary of the configuration under Alfven-heating
conditions in the U-3M torsatron.
  **** Topological aspects of island divertor studies on W7-AS
  The structure of the edge plasma in W7-AS, observed with probes, television
camera, and H-alpha light agrees at low beta with vacuum field calculations:
the low-valued resonances at iotabar=5/m are resolved for m = 8 to 11; external
perturbations are not significant at the edge, even for iotabar = 5/10.
  **** 140-GHz second harmonic O-mode electron cyclotron heating at W7-AS
  First experimental results are presented of 140-GHz second harmonic O-mode
(0.7-MW power) ECRH at a high electron density of 1.8 x 10^20 m^-3 on W7-AS.
