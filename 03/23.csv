sensitive to the H I column density, since large fraction of the emission is
emitted just below the hydrogen Lyman edge. The {\it EUVE} sources with large

suppression of tunneling between the phases, which becomes very strong as soon

avoided by making the monopole coupling a dynamical variable. In this manner
one can circumvent the tunneling barrier by effectively riding on top of the
peaks in the energy distribution which meet for sufficiently large monopole
coupling. Here we present an efficient method for determining the parameters
needed for this procedure, which can thus be implemented at low computational
cost also on large lattices. This is particularly important for a reliable
determination of the transition point. We demonstrate the working of our method

of the order of $10^{-7}\;-\;10^{-6}$ which values are well below the upper

possibly, more chaotic systems. However, the behaviour of systems related to
symmetric designs with additional identities is simpler than for general ones

various algebraic structures beyond Lie algebras may be regarded as certain
