of the bipolar outflow source AFGL5142. The high resolution of our molecular CO
observations enables us to define the morphology of the large-scale bipolar
outflow into a two lobe structure extending for 2' on each side of the center.
In the perpendicular direction, we find consistent evidence for a second, more
compact (<0.5') outflow in the form of a spatial velocity offset in the CO map
and of an H2 jet-like structure derived from a near infrared narrow band image.
On a smaller scale size, the radio and infrared continuum observations reveal
the engines of the molecular outflows. The maser emission occurs near the
position of the most embedded source of the cluster, IRS1. This is located at
the center of the compact outflow and jets of shocked H2 and coincides with an
ultra compact radio continuum source (most probably an ionized stellar wind).
The H2O cluster is composed of five spatial components: two are within 0.3''
from the YSO (a few hundred AU) and three are at larger distance (1.5--2'', a
few thousand AU). A marginal detection of proper motion of the two more distant
masers may suggest a high expansion velocity at a distance 4000 AU from the
YSO, similar to what is found in Orion KL and W49N. The brightest NIR source of
the cluster (IRS2) is associated with an IRAS point source and lies along the
axis of the large-scale bipolar outflow. We propose that the masers and the
compact molecular outflow are powered concurrently by the wind from the YSO
associated with IRS1, while the large-scale outflow could be the remnant from
the formation of IRS2.

functions for general $q$ and $d$. We establish a correspondence between the

metal-insulator transition. Using resonant photoemission we study how this
chemical substitution affects the electronic structure of the material. For the
partial Cu-density of states at E_F and in the region of the valence band we
observe no significant difference between a pure superconducting sample and an
insulating sample with 60% Pr for Ca. This suggests that the states responsible
for superconductivity are predomi- nately O-states. The partial Pr-4f density
of states was extracted utilizing the Super- Koster-Kronig Pr 4d-4f resonance.
It consists of a single peak at 1.36eV binding energy. The peak shows a
strongly assymetric Doniach-Sunjic line- shape indicating the presence of a
continuum of electronic states with sharp cut off at E_F even in this
insulating sample. This finding excludes a bandgap in the insulating sample and
supports the existance of a mobility gap caused by spatial localization of the
carriers. The presence of such carriers at the Pr-site, between the CuO_2
planes shows that the electronic structure is not purely 2-dimensional but that
there is a finite interlayer coupling. The resonance enhancement of the
photoemission cross section, at the Pr-4d threshold, was studied for the Pr-4f
and for Cu-states. Both the Pr-4f and the Cu-states show a Fano-like resonance.
This resonance of Cu-states with Pr-states is another indication of coupling
between the the Pr-states and those in the CuO_2 plane. Because of the
statistical distribution of the Pr-ions this coupling leads to a non-periodic
potential for the states in the CuO_2 plane which can lead to localization and
thus to the observed metal-insulator transition.

scattering experiments. A proposal by L\""uscher enables one to determine
infinite volume elastic scattering phases from the two-particle energy spectrum
measured from finite periodic lattices. In this work, we generalize the
formalism to the case where the total momentum of the particles is non-zero;
i.e. the lattice frame is not the center-of-mass frame of the scattering
particles. There are several advantages to this procedure including making a
wider variety of center of mass energies accessible with a fixed lattice
volume, and making the avoided level crossing in a P-wave decay occur with a
smaller volume. The formalism is tested with a simple lattice model of two
fields with different masses and a 3-point coupling in 3+1 dimensions. We find
remarkable agreement between the rest-frame and non-rest-frame scattering.

function ($wf$) at the end-point region ($x\to 1$ and $\k\to\infty$) by
analysing the corresponding large $n-$th moments in transverse
$\la\vec{k}_{\perp}^{2n}\ra \sim n!$ and longitudinal $\la (2x-1)^n\ra \sim
1/n^2$ directions. This information fixes the asymptotic behavior of $wf$ at
large $\k$ (which is turned out to be Gaussian commonly used in the
phenomenological analyses). We discuss one particular application of the
obtained results. We calculate the nonleading ""soft"" contribution to the pion
form factor at intermediate momentum transfer. We argue, that due to the
specific properties of $\psi(\k, x)$, the corresponding contribution can
temporarily {\bf simulate} the leading twist behavior in the extent region of $

Yan and Deep Inelastic) where intrinsic $\pi$ meson structure might be
essential. The relation to the valence quark model is also discussed.
