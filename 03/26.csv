concerning the number of critical points of a (multivalued) meromorphic
function $\phi$ on an algebraic manifold. Under certain conditions, this number
turns out to coincide with the Euler characteristic (up to a sign) of the
complement of the divisor of $\phi$. A few variants of this basic situation are
also discussed. Two independent proofs are given, respectively using Chern
classes and Morse theory
  In its original form, this counting problem arises (in special cases) in
evaluating the asymptotics of correlation functions of Wess--Zumino--Witten
conformal field theory.

of any hierarchical clustering scenario. In these models, low surface
brightness galaxies form at late times from small initial overdensities, and
make up most of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. Because there
are tremendous observational biases against finding low surface brightness
galaxies, the observed faint end of the galaxy luminosity function may easily
fall short of predictions, if hierarchical structure formation is correct. We
calculate the number density and mass density in collapsed objects as a
function of baryonic surface density and redshift, and show that the mass in
recently formed low surface brightness galaxies can be comparable to the mass
bound into ``normal'' high surface brightness galaxies. Because of their low
gas surface densities, these galaxies are easily ionized by the UV background
and are not expected to appear in HI surveys. Low surface brightness galaxies
(LSBs) are not a special case of galaxy formation and are perhaps better viewed
as a continuance of the Hubble sequence.

permutation symmetry) for three light neutrinos. Our neutrino mass matrix has
smaller permutation symmetry $S_{2}$ ($\nu_{\mu} \leftrightarrow \nu_{e}$), and
is consistent with all neutrino experiments except the $^{37}$Cl experiment.
The resulting mass eigenvalues for three neutrinos are $m_{1} \approx
(2.55-1.27) \times 10^{-3} eV, m_{2,3} \approx (0.71-1.43) eV$ for $\Delta
m_{LSND}^{2} = 0.5 - 2.0 eV^2$. Then these light neutrinos can account for
$\sim (2.4-4.8)% (6.2-12.4 %)$ of the dark matter for $h = 0.8 (0.5)$. Our
model predicts the $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{\tau}$ oscillation probability
in the range sensitive to the future experiments such as CHORUS and NOMAD.

non-universality of parton structure of the effective Pomeron are explained.
New hard phenomena directly calculable in QCD such as diffractive
electroproduction of states with $M^2\ll Q^2$ and the color transparency
phenomenon as well as new options to measure the light-cone wave functions of
various hadrons are considered. An analogue of Bjorken scaling is predicted for
the diffractive electroproduction of $\rho$ mesons at large momentum transfers
and for the production of large rapidity gap events, as observed at HERA. A
phenomenological QCD evolution equation is suggested to calculate the basic
characteristics of the large rapidity gap events. The increase of parton
densities at small $x$ as well as new means to disentangle experimentally soft
and hard physics are considered. We discuss constraints on the increase of deep
inelastic amplitudes with $Q^2$ derived from the inconsistency of QCD
predictions for inclusive and exclusive processes and from unitarity of the S
matrix for collisions of wave packets. New ways to probe QCD physics of hard
processes at large longitudinal distances and to answer the long standing
problems on the origin of the Pomeron are suggested. Unresolved problems and
perspectives of small $x$ physics are also outlined.

precisely the spins of conserved W currents. We apply this test to TFTs based
on strictly hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras and show that there exist no
resonances other than that at n=2, which corresponds to the energy-momentum
tensor, indicating their non-integrability. We also check by direct calculation
that there are no spin-3 nor -4 conserved currents for all the hyperbolic TFTs
in agreement with the result of our Painlev\'{e} analysis.
