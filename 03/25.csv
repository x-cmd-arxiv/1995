  N-body Simulations","submitted to ApJL. compressed postscript file includes figures.",,"10.1086/176745",,"astro-ph",,"  N-body simulations that follow only a collisionless dark matter component
have failed to produce galaxy halos or substructure within dense environments.
We investigate the `over-merging' problem analytically and with numerical
simulations, by calculating dissolution timescales of halos due to physical and
artificial dynamical effects. The numerical resolution that has recently been
attained is such that mass-loss from two-body relaxation is negligible. We
demonstrate that substructure is destroyed in present simulations as a result
of large force softening combined with the heating sources of tides and
encounters with dissolving substructure. In the limit of infinite numerical
resolution, whether or not individual halos or substructure can survive depends
sensitively on their inner density profiles. Singular isothermal halos will
always survive at some level, however, if halos form with large core radii then
the over-merging problem will always exist within dissipationless N-body
simulations. In this latter case a dissipational component can increase the
halos central density enabling galaxies to survive.

sets in a study of the redshift evolution and the column density distribution
function for absorbers with $\log$N(HI)$\ge17.5$, over the redshift range 0.01

The data are well fit by a power law $N(z) = N_0(1 + z)^{\gamma}$ for the
number density per unit redshift. For the first time intrinsic evolution is
detected in the product of the absorption cross-section and comoving spatial
number density for an $\Omega = 1$ Universe. We find $\gamma = 1.55$ ($\gamma =
0.5$ for no evolution) and $N_0 = 0.27$ with $>$99.7\% confidence limits for
$\gamma$ of 0.82 \& 2.37. \item Damped \lya systems: The APM QSOs provide a
substantial increase in the redshift path available for damped surveys for
$z>3$. Eleven candidate and three confirmed damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption
systems, have been identified in the APM QSO spectra covering the redshift
range $2.8\le z \le 4.4$ (11 with $z>3.5$). Combining the APM survey confirmed

a turnover at z$\sim$3 or a flattening at z$\sim$2 in the cosmological mass

the detection of burst signals emitted during a supernova explosion, but have
not resulted in any confirmed detections. An alternative approach has been to
search for continuous wave (CW) gravitational radiation from the Crab pulsar.
In this paper, we examine the possibility of detecting CW gravitational
radiation from pulsars and show that nearby millisecond pulsars are generally
much better candidates. We show that the minimum strain h_c ~ 10E-26 that can
be detected by tuning an antenna to the frequency of the milli- second pulsar
PSR 1957+20, with presently available detector technology, is orders of
magnitude better than what has been accomplished so far by observing the Crab
pulsar, and within an order of magnitude of the maximum strain that may be
produced by it. In addition, we point out that there is likely to be a
population of rapidly rotating neutron stars (not necessarily radio pulsars) in
the solar neighborhood whose spindown evolution is driven by gravitational
radiation. We argue that the projected sensitivity of modern resonant detectors
is sufficient to detect the subset of this population that lies within 0.1 kpc
of the sun.

study of the same revealed some unexpected features which indicated that
correction terms of the order of log(h) had to be included in the periodic
orbit sum. Such singular semiclassical behaviour was also found in the simplest
traces of the quantum map. In this note we study the quantum mechanics of a
baker's map which is obtained by reflecting the classical map about its edges,
in an effort to understand and circumvent these anomalies. This leads to a real
quantum map with traces that follow the usual Gutzwiller-Tabor like
semiclassical formulae. We develop the relevant semiclassical periodic orbit
sum for this map which is closely related to that of the usual baker's map,
with the important difference that the propagators leading to this sum have no

into account. The magnetic field is axisymmetric and poloidal. Five dense
matter equations of state are employed. The partial differential equation
system is integrated by means of a pseudo-spectral method. Various tests passed
by the numerical code are presented. The effects of the magnetic field on
neutron stars structure are then investigated, especially by comparing
magnetized and non-magnetized configurations with the same baryon number. The
deformation of the star induced by the magnetic field is important only for
huge values of B (B>10^{10} T). The maximum mass as well as the maximum
rotational velocity are found to increase with the magnetic field. The maximum
allowable poloidal magnetic field is of the order of 10^{14} T (10^{18} G) and
is reached when the magnetic pressure is comparable to the fluid pressure at
the centre of the star. For such values, the maximum mass of neutron stars is

is argued that attributes of classical spatial topology emerge from properties
of state vectors with suitably smooth time evolution. Equivalently, they emerge
from considerations on the domain of the quantum Hamiltonian, this domain being
often specified by boundary conditions in elementary quantum physics. Several
examples are presented where classical topology is changed by smoothly altering
the boundary conditions. When the parameters labelling the latter are treated
as quantum variables, quantum states need not give a well-defined classical
topology, instead they can give a quantum superposition of such topologies. An
existing argument of Sorkin based on the spin-statistics connection and
indicating the necessity of topology change in quantum gravity is recalled. It
is suggested therefrom and our results here that Einstein gravity and its minor
variants are effective theories of a deeper description with additional novel
degrees of freedom. Other reasons for suspecting such a microstructure are also

  superstructure","revised version -- refs are updated",,,"ESI-167","solv-int nlin.SI",,"  The classical and quantum dynamics of the noncanonically coupled oscillators
is considered. It is shown that though the classical dynamics is well--defined
for both harmonic and anharmonic oscillators, the quantum one is well--defined
in the harmonic case, admits a hidden (super)Hamiltonian formulation, and thus,
preserves the initial operator relations, whereas a na\""\i ve quantization of
the anharmonic case meets with principal difficulties.
