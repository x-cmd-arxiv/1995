density of gas in forming stars over large scales. After the hydrogen has
recombined, as the external ionizing UV flux decreases and the metal abundance
$Z$ increases, the HI, initially in the warm phase ($T\simgt 5000$ K), makes a
transition to the cool phase ($T\simlt 100$ K). The minimum abundance $Z_{min}$
for which this phase transition takes place in a small fraction of the Hubble
time decreases rapidly with increasing gas column density. Therefore in the
``anemic'' disk galaxies, where $N_{HI}$ is up to ten times smaller than for
normal large spirals, the onset of the cool HI phase is delayed. The onset of
gravitational instability is also delayed, since these objects are more likely
to be gravitationally stable in the warm phase than progenitors of today's
large spiral galaxies. The first substantial burst of star formation may occur
only as late as at redshifts $z \sim 0.5$ and give a temporary high peak
luminosity, which may be related to the ``faint blue objects"". Galaxy disks of
lower column density tend to have lower escape velocities and a
starburst/galactic fountain instability which decreases the gas content of the
inner disk drastically.

a diffuse gas, photoionized and heated by a radiation field, cooled by
collisional excitation of hydrogen and metal lines. The hydrogen recombination
reaction has a stabilizing effect on the thermal mode found by Field (1965)
since the condensation instability occurs in a narrower region of the parameter
space and grows on longer time scales due to its oscillatory character. This
effect is stronger when the mean photon energy is not much larger than the
hydrogen ionization energy. Moreover, for fixed values of thermal pressure and
photoionization rate, there are thermo- reactive unstable equilibria for which
no transition to a stable phase is possible. By extending our analysis of the
thermo-reactive modes to the nonlinear regime we show that when no phase
transition is possible the medium evolves through a series of nonequilibrium
states characterized by large amplitude, nonlinear periodic oscillations of
temperature, density and hydrogen ionization fraction. We find also unstable
acoustic waves which, for solar metal abundances, are the fastest growing modes
in two temperature intervals: around $T\sim 100$~K and $T\sim 8000$~K (i.e.
cold and warm phase, respectively), independent of the mean photon energy.

renormalization scheme independently expressed in terms of a rigid Ward
identity. The corresponding local version yields information on the respective
current. In the case of spontaneous breakdown one has to define the theory via
the BRS invariance and thus to construct rigid and current Ward identity
non-trivially in accordance with it. We performed this construction to all
orders of perturbation theory in the abelian Higgs model as a prelude to the
standard model. A technical tool of interest in itself is the use of a doublet
of external scalar ``background'' fields. The Callan-Symanzik equation has an
interesting form and follows easily once the rigid invariance is established.

rise to a class of exact solutions when coupled to Einstein Maxwell Dilaton
gravity obeying the Majumdar-Papapetrou(MP) relation between gravitational and
Maxwell couplings , provided certain Chern-Simons type interactions are
present. The metric may be solved for explicitly in terms of the NO vortex
function and becomes degenerate at scales $r_H \sim l_S exp(\frac{l_S}{l_P})$
where $l_S$ is the vortex core size and $l_P$ the Planck length. For typical
$l_S\geq 10^4 l_P$ the horizon is thus pushed out to exponentially large
scales. In the intermediate asymptotic region (IAR) $l_S<<r<<r_H$ there is a
logarithmic deviation of the metric from the flat metric and of the electric
field from that of a point charge (which makes it decrease {\it{slower}} than
$r^{-1}$ :hence the prefix hyper). In the IAR the ADM energy and charge
integrals increase logarithmically with the distance from the core region and
finally diverge at the signature change horizon. String solutions in $4+p$
dimensions are obtained by replacing the Maxwell fiel0d by an antisymmetric
tensor field (of rank $2+p$) and have essentially similar properties with $r_H
\sim l_S exp((\frac{l_S}{l_P})^{2+p})$ and with the antisymmetric charge
playing the role of the topological electric charge .

the off shell situations met in the problem and, as a consequence, the $pp
\rightarrow pp \pi^{0}$ cross section becomes considerably larger than with the
use of the $\pi N$ on shell amplitudes. Two different models for the off shell
extrapolation found in the literature have been used and the cross sections
obtained are large enough to account for the experimental data, although
uncertainties remain due to the incomplete knowledge of the off shell
extrapolation.

model independent way within the scope of the multichannel model, but with the
restricting assumption that only one resonance is included per partial wave.
One has only to use the information on $\pi N$ elastic S-wave T-matrix at the
$\eta$ production threshold, and near threshold $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow \eta n$
total cross section. The results are independent of the particular
parametrization of the elastic T-matrix and of the number of channels. For the
described model the unitarity requires that the number of channels must be at
least three. These assumptions are more general then the assumptions of the
existing single resonance models up to now used for extracting the $\eta N$
S-wave scattering length. The agreement of our approach with former estimates
is anticipated and confirmed for all cases for which the input data agree with
the commonly accepted values.

isotopy (graph invariants of Vassiliev type). They are given by a functor from
a category of colored and oriented graphs embedded into a 3-space to a category

known as the Vassiliev invariants of finite type. In the present paper, we
construct two types of tangle operators of vertices. One of them corresponds to
a Casimir operator insertion at a transverse double point of Wilson loops. This
paper proposes a non-perturbative generalization of Kauffman's recent result
based on a perturbative analysis of the Chern-Simons quantum field theory. As a
result, a quantum group analog of Penrose's spin network is established taking
into account of the orientation. We also deal with the 4-dimensional canonical
quantum gravity of Ashtekar. It is verified that the graph invariants of
Vassiliev type are compatible with constraints of the quantum gravity in the
loop space representation of Rovelli and Smolin.

limit turns out to be related to the time-energy uncertainty relation discussed
