We find that microlensing events produced by random motion of stars are
shorter, steeper, and more frequent than bulk motion events. This difference is
caused by the fact that in the case of random motion, caustics can move with
arbitrarily high velocity, producing very short events. An accompanying video
illustrates these results. For three different values of the surface mass

disordered GSs give diffraction patterns which are only weakly distinguished

evident beneath the delta functions. Finally, in some cases, the long-ranged

for various Josephson-coupling anisotropies and for various temperatures in

region, the interlayer coupling, which causes the non-vanishing critical
current ($I_{c}$), is suppressed by thermal fluctuations, and tends to push up
the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature ($T_{KT}$) of the
two-dimensional (2D) regime. In this highly anisotropic region, $I_c$ begins to
decrease drastically near $T_{KT}$. This suggests that interlayer coupling is
screened by thermally excited 2D small vortex-antivortex pairs as well as the
intralayer logarithmic part of vortex-antivortex interactions. Moreover, weak
magnetic fields parallel to the $c$-axis affect only the
logarithmic-interaction part between the 2D pancake vortices.

Leins, Nollert and Soffel (1993) Specifically, we are able to explain why
several modes in this regime of the complex frequency plane could not be

we have established that the ``kink'' that was a prominent feature of the
spectra of Kokkotas and Schutz, but did not appear in the results of Leins {\em

able to compute, for the first time, several of the slowly damped (p) modes for
the considered stellar models. For very compact stars we find, somewhat
surprisingly, that the damping of these modes does not decrease monotonically
as one proceeds to higher oscillation frequencies. The existence of low-order
modes that damp away much faster than anticipated may have implications for
questions regarding stellar stability and the lifetime of gravitational-wave
sources. The present results illustrate the accuracy and reliability of the
complex-coordinate method and indicate that the method could prove to be of
great use also in problems involving rotating stars. There is no apparent

considering the symmetry property of the weight function, which is
corresponding to the three-dimensional Baxter-Bazhanov model. The vertex type
weight function is parametrized as the dihedral angles between the rapidity
planes connected with the cube. And we write down the symmetry relations of the

thickness of a few molecular diameters are described. Confining walls introduce
layering and in-plane order in the adjacent fluid. The latter is essential to
transfer of shear stress. As the film thickness is decreased, by increasing
pressure or decreasing the number of molecular layers, the entire film may
undergo a phase transition. Spherical molecules tend to crystallize, while
short chain molecules enter a glassy state with strong local orientational and
translational order. These phase transitions lead to dramatic changes in the
response of the film to imposed shear velocities $v$. Spherical molecules show
an abrupt transition from Newtonian response to a yield stress as they
crystallize. Chain molecules exhibit a continuously growing regime of
non-Newtonian behavior where the shear viscosity drops as $v^{-2/3}$ at
constant normal load. The same power law is found for a wide range of
parameters, and extends to lower and lower velocities as a glass transition is
approached. Once in the glassy state, chain molecules exhibit a finite yield
stress. Shear may occur either within the film or at the film/wall interface.
Interfacial shear dominates when films become glassy and when the film
viscosity is increased by increasing the chain length.
