objects discovered in the peculiar galaxy NGC 1275 by Holtzman et al. using
Hubble Space Telescope images. These spectra show strong Balmer absorption
lines like those observed in A-type stars, as expected if the object is a young
globular cluster. The age estimated from the strength of the Balmer lines is
about 0.5 Gyr, although ages ranging from 0.1 Gyr to 0.9 Gyr can not be
confidently excluded given current models of stellar populations. If these
estimated ages are adopted for the young cluster population of NGC 1275 as a
whole, the fading predicted by stellar populations models gives a luminosity
function which is consistent with that of the Galactic globular cluster system
convolved with the observational selection function for the NGC 1275 system. We
also use the equivalent widths of the Mg $b$ and Fe 5270 features to constrain
the metallicity of the young cluster. Combining these absorption-line widths
with the age estimates from the Balmer lines and stellar population models, we
find a metallicity of roughly solar based on the Mg $b$ index and somewhat
higher for the Fe 5270 index. The radial velocity of the absorption lines of
the cluster spectrum is offset from the emission lines of the galaxy spectrum
at the same position by $-130$ \kms, providing further evidence for the
identification of the object as a globular cluster, and opening up the future
possibility of studying the kinematics of young cluster systems. The discovery
of objects with the characteristics of young globular clusters in NGC 1275,
which shows evidence of a recent interaction or merger, supports the hypothesis
that galaxy interactions and mergers are favorable sites for the formation of
globular clusters.

bremsstrahlung temperature suggests that soft X-ray emission peaks in the
orbital phase interval 0.75-0.90, when an outer disk hot spot is near the line
of sight. This correlates with the orbital modulation of C IV($\lambda$1549)
absorption. Timing analysis indicates that while the source gets brighter, the
frequency of the 1mHz oscillation is not correlated with X-ray intensity. This

expectation functions for two-valued observables are discussed. Special
emphasis is given to hypothetical stronger-than quantum expectation functions
which give rise to a maximal violation of Bell's inequality.

  Generalized Coherent States, Squeezing and Geometric Phases","22 pages, LATEX",,,"FIAN-OD-95-03","quant-ph",,"  Within the new description of the polarization structure of quantum light
(given in Part I) some types of generalized coherent states related to the
polarization SU(2) group are examined. With their help we give a quasiclassical
description of polarization properties of light fields and discuss the concept
of squeezing and uncertainty relations for multimode light in the polarization
quantum optics. As a consequence, a new classification of polarization states
of quantum light is obtained. We also derive geometric phases acquired by
different quantum light beams transmitted through ""polarization rotators"".

as transitions between the system's energy levels. We show for a general
stationary situation that the energy shifts can essentially be reduced to the
relaxation rates. The effects of reservoir fluctuations and self reaction are
treated separately. We apply the results to a two-level atom coupled to a
reservoir which may be the vacuum of a radiation field.
