proved that $X \times_G Y$ is connected when $codim f(X) + codim g(Y) < n$. We
show that the conclusion holds under the often weaker hypothesis
$f(X).g(Y).T\ne 0$, where $T$ is the class of $G(d,n-1)$ in $G$.
  We prove similar results when $G$ is a product of projective spaces. In
particular, if $D$ is an irreducible subvariety of $P^n\times P^n$ of dimension
$n$ which dominates both factors, and if $X$ is complete irreducible, with a
morphism $f: X \rightarrow P^n\times P^n$ such that $dim f(X) >n$, $f^{-1}(D)$
is connected. This extends the classical Fulton-Hansen connectedness theorem.
These results illustrate Fulton and Lazarsfeld's idea that connectedness should
be a numerical property.

image of Coma having RMS noise of 27.7 R mag~arcsec$^{-2}$. A correction for
objects in the foreground or background of the Coma cluster---and the
uncertainty in this correction---are determined from images of five other
high-latitude fields, carefully matched to the Coma image in both resolution
and noise level. Accurate counts of Coma cluster members are obtained as faint
as R=25.5, or M_R=-9.4. The LF for galaxies is well fit by a power law
dN/dL\propto L^\alpha, with \alpha=-1.42\pm0.05, over the range
-19.4<M_R<-11.4; faintward of this range, the galaxies are unresolved and
indistinguishable from globular clusters, but the data are consistent with an
extrapolation of the power law. Surface brightness biases are minimized since
galaxies are not subjected to morphological selection, and the limiting
detection isophote is 27.6 R mag~arcsec$^{-2}$. We find the typical
$M_R\approx-12$ Coma cluster galaxy to have an exponential scale length
$\approx200$~pc, similar to Local Group galaxies of comparable magnitude. These
extreme dwarf galaxies show a surface density increasing towards the giant
elliptical NGC~4874 as $r^{-1.3}$, similar to the diffuse light and globular
cluster distributions. The luminosity in the detected dwarf galaxies is at most
a few percent of the total diffuse light of the giant galaxies in the cluster,
and the contribution of the dwarfs to the mass of the cluster is likely
negligible as well.

the limit of high resolution, the lattice equations become the usual
integro-differential equations of stellar dynamics. The technique complements
other tools for solving those equations approximately, such as $N$-body
simulation, or techniques based on phase-space grids. Equilibria are found in a
variety of shapes and sizes. They are true equilibria in the sense that they do
not evolve with time, even slowly, unlike existing $N$-body approximations to
stellar systems, which are subject to two-body relaxation. They can also be
`tailor-made' in the sense that the mass distribution is constrained to be
close to some pre-specified function. Their principal limitation is the amount
of memory required to store the lattice, which in practice restricts the
technique to modeling systems with a high degree of symmetry. We also develop a
method for analysing the linear stability of collisionless systems, based on
lattice equilibria as an unperturbed model.

to compute exactly the full probability distribution of the velocity difference

Brown and York, (ii) the closely related approach of Ba\~nados, Teitelboim, and
Zanelli which ultimately expresses black hole entropy in terms of the Hilbert
action surface term, (iii) another formula of Ba\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli
(also used by Susskind and Uglum) which views black hole entropy as conjugate
to a conical deficit angle, and (iv) the pair creation approach of Garfinkle,
Giddings, and Strominger. All of these approaches have a more restrictive
domain of applicability than the Noether charge approach. Specifically,
approaches (i) and (ii) appear to be restricted to a class of theories
satisfying certain properties listed in section 2; approach (iii) appears to
require the Lagrangian density to be linear in the curvature; and approach (iv)
requires the existence of suitable instanton solutions. However, we show that
within their domains of applicability, all of these approaches yield results in
agreement with the Noether charge approach. In the course of our analysis, we
generalize the definition of Brown and York's quasilocal energy to a much more
general class of diffeomorphism invariant, Lagrangian theories of gravity. In
an appendix, we show that in an arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant theory of
gravity, the ``volume term"" in the ``off-shell"" Hamiltonian associated with a

bosonize quantized fermion systems in arbitrary dimension $D$ in the low energy
regime. In its original (minimal) form, dualization is restricted to models
wherein it is possible to define a dynamical quantized conserved charge. We
generalize the usual dualization prescription to include systems with dynamical
non--conserved quantum currents. Bosonization based on this extended
dualization requires the introduction of an additional rank $0$ (scalar) field
together with the usual antisymmetric tensor field of rank $(D-2)$. Our
generalized dualization prescription permits one to clearly distinguish the
arbitrariness in the bosonization from the arbitrariness in the quantization of
the system. We study the bosonization of four--fermion interactions with large
mass in arbitrary dimension. First, we observe that dualization permits one to
formally bosonize these models by invoking the bosonization of the free massive
Dirac fermion and adding some extra model--dependent bosonic terms. Secondly,
we explore the potential of extended dualization by considering the particular
case of \underbar{chiral} four--fermion interactions. Here minimal dualization
is inadequate for calculating the extra bosonic terms. We demonstrate the
utility of extended dualization by successfully completing the bosonization of
this chiral model. Finally, we consider two examples in two dimensions which
illuminate the utility of using extended dualization by showing how
quantization ambiguities in a fermionic theory propagate into the bosonized
version. An explicit parametrization of the quantization ambiguities of the
chiral current in the Chiral Schwinger model is obtained. Similarly, for the

spins $\demi$ and $J$) and the required form of the co-product action of the
Hilbert space generators of the quantum group symmetry is put forward. This
gives an explicit operator realization of the co-product action on the
covariant operators. It allows us to derive the quantum group covariance of the
fusion and braiding matrices, although it is of a new type: the generators
depend upon worldsheet variables, and obey a new central extension of
$U_q(sl(2))$ realized by (what we call) fixed point commutation relations. This
is explained by showing that the link between the algebra of field
transformations and that of the co-product generators is much weaker than
previously thought. The central charges of our extended $U_q(sl(2))$ algebra,
which includes the Liouville zero-mode momentum in a nontrivial way are related
to Virasoro-descendants of unity. We also show how our approach can be used to
derive the Hopf algebra structure of the extended quantum-group symmetry
$U_q(sl(2))\odot U_{\qhat}(sl(2))$ related to the presence of both of the
screening charges of 2D gravity.

the one-body density matrix in terms of those natural orbits, which exhibit the
largest occupation probabilities. For the investigation of the high-momentum
components in the single-particle density, however, it is important to take
into account natural orbits with small occupation probabilities, originating
from the single-particle Green function at large negative energies.

first paper, Schreodinger's equation for the density matrix is fist obtained

momentum and position operators acting upon the density matrix are defined and
it is then demonstrated that they commute. Pauli's equation for the density
matrix is also obtained. A statistical potential formally identical to the
quantum potential of Bohm's hidden variable theory is introduced, and this
quantum potential is reinterpreted through the formalism here proposed. It is
shown that, for dispersion free {\it ensembles% }, Schroedinger's equation for
the density matrix is equivalent to Newton's equations. A general non-ambiguous
procedure for the construction of operators which act upon the density matrix
is presented. It is also shown how these operators can be reduced to those
which act upon the wave functions.

order equation should be considered the fundamental one in spite of the first
order equation. A relativistic expression is obtained for the statistical
potential. Axioms are again altered and made compatible with the general theory
of relativity. These postulates, together with the idea of the statistical
potential, allow us to obtain a general relativistic quantum theory for {\it

that the uncertainty relations possess no ontological validity and only reflect
the formalism's limitations. In this paper, a Realist Interpretation of quantum
mechanics based on these results is elaborated and compared to the Copenhagen
Interpretation. We demonstrate that von Neumann's proof of the impossibility of
a hidden variable theory is not correct, independently of Bell's argumentation.
A local hidden variable theory is found for non-relativistic quantum mechanics,
which is nothing else than newtonian mechanics itself. We prove that Bell's
theorem does not imply in a non-locality of quantum mechanics, and also
demonstrate that Bohm's theory cannot be considered a true hidden variable
theory.

of the earlier proposals by Aleksandrov and by Boucher and Traschen is
achieved. Coupling of quantized matter to gravity is illustrated by a
simplistic example.

this, we rewrite all of its formalism for integer and half integer spin
particles and present the world revealed by this conjecture. We also base the
theory on the second order Klein-Gordon's and Dirac's equations and show that
they can be stated with only positive definite energies. In the second paper we
show that the general relativistic quantum mechanics derived in paper II of

for the loss of energy quantization. We relate this property with the ideas of
irreversibility and time arrow.
