cross-sections in the presence of a strong external magnetic field. We
demonstrate that all such divergences may be eliminated by introducing
radiative corrections to the leading-order scattering amplitudes. These
corrections impose a choice of basis states that must be used in scattering
calculations: electron states must diagonalize the mass operator, while photon
states must diagonalize the polarization operator. The radiative corrections
introduce natural line-widths into the energy denominators of all propagators,
as well as into the time-development exponentials of all scattering states
corresponding to external lines. Since initial and final scattering states may
now decay, it is logically necessary to compute scattering amplitudes for a
finite time-lapse between the preparation of the initial state and the
measurement of the final state. Strict energy conservation, which appeared in
previous formulations of the theory, must thus be abandoned. We exhibit the
generic formulae for the scattering cross-sections in two useful limits,
corresponding to the cases where either the initial states or the final states
are stable, and discuss the application of the general formula when neither of
these limits applies.

Arnold cat map and the quantum kicked rotor are chosen as examples of linear

formalism is used to study the effect of the environment on the system. It is
well-known that quantum coherence can obliterate many chaotic behavior in the
corresponding classical system. But interaction with an environment can under
general circumstances quickly diminish quantum coherence and reenact many
classical chaotic behavior. How effective decoherence works to sustain chaos,
and how the resultant behavior qualitatively differs from the quantum picture
depend on the coupling of the system with the environment and the spectral
density and temperature of the environment. We show how recurrence in the
quantum cat map is lost and classical ergodicity is recovered due to the effect
of the environment. Quantum coherence and diffusion suppression are
instrumental to dynamical localization for the kicked rotor. We show how
environment-induced effects can destroy this localization. Such effects can
also be understood as resulting from external noises driving the system.
Peculiar to decohering chaotic systems is the apparent transition from
reversible to irreversible dynamics. We show such transitions in the quantum

ignored, and the superpartner masses are less than about 500 GeV, the
prediction for alpha_s(M_Z) is quite large. We impose constraints from nucleon
decay experiments and find that minimal SU(5) GUT threshold corrections
increase alpha_s(M_Z) over most of the parameter space. We also consider the
missing-doublet SU(5) model and find that it predicts preferred values for the
strong coupling, even for a very light superpartner spectrum. We briefly

breaking is reexamined. It is argued that one cannot have stable minima with
broken supersymmetry in models where the dilaton is coupled only linearly to
the gaugino condensate. We show that the problems of the gaugino condensate
mechanism can be solved by considering nonstandard gauge kinetic functions,
created by nonperturbative effects. As an example we use the principle of
S-duality to modify the coupling of the gaugino condensate to effective
supergravity (superstring) Lagrangians. We show that such an approach can solve
the problem of the runaway dilaton and lead to satisfactory supersymmetry
breaking in models with a {\em single} gaugino condensate. We exhibit a general
property of theories containing a symmetry acting on the dilaton and also shed
some light on the question whether it is generically the auxiliary field of the
modulus $T$, which dominates supersymmetry breaking.
