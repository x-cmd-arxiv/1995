  We consider hyperbolic (i.e. signature $(n,1)$) integral symmetric bilinear
form $S:M\times M \to {\Bbb Z}$ (i.e. hyperbolic lattice), reflection group
$W\subset W(S)$, fundamental polyhedron $\Cal M$ of $W$ and an acceptable
(corresponding to twisting coefficients) set $P({\Cal M})\subset M$ of vectors
orthogonal to faces of $\Cal M$ (simple roots). One can construct the
corresponding Lorentzian Kac--Moody Lie algebra ${\goth g}={\goth
g}^{\prime\prime}(A(S,W,P({\Cal M})))$ which is graded by $M$.
  We show that $\goth g$ has good behavior of imaginary roots, its denominator
formula is defined in a natural domain and has good automorphic properties if
and only if $\goth g$ has so called {\it restricted arithmetic type}. We show
that every finitely generated (i.e. $P({\Cal M})$ is finite) algebra ${\goth
g}^{\prime\prime}(A(S,W_1,P({\Cal M}_1)))$ may be embedded to ${\goth
g}^{\prime\prime}(A(S,W,P({\Cal M})))$ of the restricted arithmetic type. Thus,
Lorentzian Kac--Moody Lie algebras of the restricted arithmetic type is a
natural class to study.
  Lorentzian Kac--Moody Lie algebras of the restricted arithmetic type have the
best automorphic properties for the denominator function if they have {\it a
lattice Weyl vector $\rho$}. Lorentzian Kac--Moody Lie algebras of the
restricted arithmetic type with generalized lattice Weyl vector $\rho$ are
called {\it elliptic}

crossing caustics which are formed by gravitational microlensing of objects
like Q2237+0305. Within this approximation the source size can be estimated
from the maximum magnification reached at caustic crossings. We evaluate the
limitations imposed by diffraction on caustics using the formalism developed by
Ulmer & Goodman (1995). Close to a caustic a new characteristic length, smaller
that the Fresnel length, enters the problem, limiting the angular resolution to
about 0.2 pico arcsecond, or equivalently about 3*10^9 cm at the source. To
achieve this resolution the brightness must be monitored at time intervals of a
few seconds. If a significant fraction of quasar luminosity comes from sources
smaller than those limits then interference effects would make the observed
intensity oscillate, in a close analogy with a two slit experiment. The
characteristic period of such oscillations is expected to be about one tenth of
a minute. If such oscillations are detected then photometry carried out at a
single site may permit the determination of the caustic transverse velocity,
and therefore may permit a direct conversion of the time units of brightness
variations to the linear units at the source. Subject headings: Gravitational

the Roth two-pole approximation to the one particle Green's function. Excellent
agreement is obtained with recent Monte Carlo calculations, including an
anomalous volume of the Fermi surface near half-filling, which can possibly be
explained in terms of a breakdown of Fermi liquid theory. The calculated bands
are very flat around the (pi,0) points of the Brillouin zone in agreement with
photoemission measurements of cuprate superconductors. With doping there is a
shift in spectral weight from the upper band to the lower band. The Roth method
is extended to deal with superconductivity within a four-pole approximation
allowing electron-hole mixing. It is shown that triplet p-wave pairing never
occurs. Singlet d_{x^2-y^2}-wave pairing is strongly favoured and optimal
doping occurs when the van Hove singularity, corresponding to the flat band
part, lies at the Fermi level. Nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic correlations
play an important role in flattening the bands near the Fermi level and in
favouring superconductivity. However the mechanism for superconductivity is a
local one, in contrast to spin fluctuation exchange models. For reasonable
values of the hopping parameter the transition temperature T_c is in the range
10-100K. The optimum doping delta_c lies between 0.14 and 0.25, depending on
the ratio U/t. The gap equation has a BCS-like form and (2*Delta_{max})/(kT_c)

theory and is found to be exactly zero in symmetric nuclear matter. This
removes uncertainties in that quantity found in former phenomenological
analyses and is supported by present experimental data on $K^{+}$ nucleus
scattering.

on the domain $SU(n+1)/S(U(1)\times U(n))$ using a completely elementary
construction: Starting from the standard star-product of Wick type on $C^{n+1}
\setminus \{ 0 \}$ and performing a quantum analogue of Marsden-Weinstein
reduction, we can give an easy algebraic description of this star-product.
Moreover, going over to a modified star-product on $C^{n+1} \setminus \{ 0 \}$,
obtained by an equivalence transformation, this description can be even further
simplified, allowing the explicit computation of a closed formula for the
star-product on $\CP^n$ which can easily transferred to the domain
$SU(n+1)/S(U(1)\times U(n))$.

potentials the singularities of the velocity field and infinity will not be
reached in finite time for typical initial values. A substantial part of the

elucidate the connection between the conditions necessary for global existence
and the self-adjointness of the Schr\""odinger Hamiltonian.
