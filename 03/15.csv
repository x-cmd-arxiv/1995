galaxies. In particular, we discuss the [O/Fe] ratio and the iron
mass-to-luminosity ratio in the intracluster medium (ICM) and their link to the
chemical and dynamical evolution of elliptical and lenticular galaxies. We
adopt a detailed model of galactic evolution incorporating the development of
supernovae- driven galactic winds which pollute the ICM with enriched ejecta.
We demonstrate \it quantitatively \rm the crucial dependence upon the assumed
stellar initial mass function in determining the evolution of the mass and
abundances ratios of heavy elements in typical model ICMs. We show that
completely opposite behaviours of [alpha/Fe] ratios (\ie positive versus
negative ratios) can be obtained by varying the initial mass function without
altering the classic assumptions regarding type Ia supernovae progenitors or
their nucleosynthesis. Our results indicate that models incorporating somewhat
flatter-than-Salpeter initial mass functions (ie x approx 1, as opposed to
x=1.35) are preferred, provided the intracluster medium iron mass-to-luminosity
ratio, preliminary [alpha/Fe]>0 ASCA results, and present-day type Ia
supernovae rates, are to be matched. A simple Virgo cluster simulation which
adheres to these constraints shows that approx 70% of the measured ICM iron
mass has its origin in type II supernovae, with the remainder being synthesized
in type Ia systems.

expose their core of the hot ashes of nuclear burning. As these hot and very
dense cores cool into white dwarf stars, they go through episodes of
multiperiodic, nonradial g-mode pulsation. The tools of stellar seismology
allow us to use the pulsation spectra as powerful probes into the deep
interiors of these stars. Progress in white dwarf seismology has required
significant international cooperation, since another consequence of the complex
pulsations of these stars is decoding the true pulsation frequencies requires a
coordinated global effort involving high-speed photometric observations.
Through one such effort, the Whole Earth Telescope project, we have located
subsurface composition changes, detected differential rotation and magnetic
fields, and measured fundamental quantities such as stellar mass, luminosity,
and distance to extraordinary accuracy.

response to a time-dependent flux in the limit that the frequency of the flux
vanishes. However, it is impossible to express the disorder average of $I_{dy}

chemical potential, because the part of the dynamic response function that
involves two retarded and two advanced Green's functions is not negligible.
Therefore the dynamics cannot be used to map a canonical average onto a more
tractable grand canonical one. We also calculate the zero frequency limit of
the dynamic current at constant chemical potential beyond linear response and
show that it is fundamentally different from any thermodynamic derivative.

a critical point in the coupling constant at $(t/U)_c=0.7483$ as in fact occurs
in the exact solution at a value of 0.5. In our approach this phase transition
is described as an example of Bifurcation Phenomena in the variational
computation of the ground state energy. In 2D the van Hove singularity plays an
essential role in changing the asymptotic behaviour of the system for large
values of $t/U$. In particular, the staggered magnetization for large $t/U$
does not display the Hartree-Fock law $(t/U) e^{-2 \pi \sqrt{t/U}}$ but instead
we find the law $(t/U) e^{- \frac{\pi ^2}{3} t/U}$. Moreover, the system does

techniques we developed to handle black hole spacetimes in the absence of
symmetries. Many different slicing conditions are tested, including geodesic,
maximal, and various algebraic conditions on the lapse. With current
resolutions, limited by computer memory sizes, we show that with certain lapse
conditions we can evolve the black hole to about $t=50M$, where $M$ is the
black hole mass. Comparisons are made with results obtained by evolving
spherical initial black hole data sets with a 1D spherically symmetric code. We
also demonstrate that an ``apparent horizon locking shift'' can be used to
prevent the development of large gradients in the metric functions that result
from singularity avoiding time slicings. We compute the mass of the apparent
horizon in these spacetimes, and find that in many cases it can be conserved to
within about 5\% throughout the evolution with our techniques and current

point of the flow equations with associated critical exponents. We also give an
approximate description of the tricritical behaviour and briefly discuss the
crossover relevant for the onset of scaling near the critical temperature.
Final confirmation of a second-order transition for strong type-II
