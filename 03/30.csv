based only on indirect astrophysical arguments. The recent unprecedented
measurement of the rotation curve of maser emission sources at the center of
NGC 4258, and the remarkable discovery that it is Keplerian to high precision,
provides us a unique opportunity for testing alternatives to a BH (e.g., a
massive cluster of stellar remnants, brown dwarfs, low-mass stars, or halo dark
matter).
  We use a conservative upper limit on the systematic deviation from a
Keplerian rotation curve to constrain the mass distribution at the galaxy
center. Based on evaporation and physical collision time-scale arguments, we
show that a central cluster is ruled out, *unless* the cluster consists of
*extremely* dense objects with mass less than about 0.05 solar masses (e.g.,
low mass BHs or elementary particles). Since both of these dynamically-allowed
systems are very improbable for other astrophysical reasons, we conclude that a
central dense cluster at the center of NGC 4258 is *very* improbable, thus
leaving the alternative possibility of a massive BH. We also show that the mass
of the BH must be at least 98% of the mass enclosed within the inner edge of
the masering disk (3.6*10^7 solar masses). A substantial contribution to that
mass from a density cusp in the background mass distribution is excluded.

gives rise to a significant enhancement to the neutron electric dipole moment
in comparison with the Standard Model prediction. The smaller degree of
suppression in this case is linked to the presence of the operators of
dimension $\leq$ 6 which enter into the effective Lagrangian with coefficients
proportional to the square of the top quark mass. Numerically, the enhancement
is mainly associated with chromoelectric dipole moment of the s quark which
appears at three loop level, of the order $\al_s\al_w^2m_sm_t^2/m^4_w$ from the
CP-odd combination of mixing angles between second, third and fourth
generations. Its value is calculated explicitly in the limit of large masses of
the fourth generation of quarks. The corresponding contribution to the electric
dipole moment of the neutron is $5\cdot10^{-30} e\cdot cm$ in the most
optimistic scenarios about the values of the Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements.
The additive renormalization of $\theta$-term in this model is estimated as
$10^{-13}$.

this four-point function exhibits a logarithmic short-distance singularity,
instead of the power-law singularity in the absence of gravity. This rather
surprising effect is non-perturbative in the gravitational coupling and is a
sign for logarithms in the gravitationally dressed operator product expansions.

former case, we recover from the linear sigma model the usual simple pole in
the ${\bf \bar {27}}^3$ Yukawa coupling but show that an analogous pole does
