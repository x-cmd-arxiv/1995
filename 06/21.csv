calculate the emerging pair annihilation radiation taking into account all
spectral broadening effects due to the energy spectra of the annihilating

spectral breaks of the inverse Compton emission in the MeV energy range with a

Langevin equation similar to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, but with
quenched disorder. (ii) The other, referred to as quenched Edwards-Wilkinson
(QEW), can be described by a Langevin equation similar to the Edwards-Wilkinson
equation but with quenched disorder. We find that for the DPD universality
class the coefficient $\lambda$ of the nonlinear term diverges at the depinning
transition, while for the QEW universality class either $\lambda = 0$ or
$\lambda \to 0$ as the depinning transition is approached. The identification
of the two universality classes allows us to better understand many of the
results previously obtained experimentally and numerically. However, we find
that some results cannot be understood in terms of the exponents obtained for
the two universality classes {\it at\/} the depinning transition. In order to
understand these remaining disagreements, we investigate the scaling properties
of models in each of the two universality classes {\it above\/} the depinning
transition. For the DPD universality class, we find for the roughness exponent
$\alpha_P = 0.63 \pm 0.03$ for the pinned phase, and $\alpha_M = 0.75 \pm 0.05$
for the moving phase. For the growth exponent, we find $\beta_P = 0.67 \pm
0.05$ for the pinned phase, and $\beta_M = 0.74 \pm 0.06$ for the moving phase.

driving force. A new exponent $\varphi_M = -0.12 \pm 0.06$, characterizing the
scaling of this prefactor, is shown to relate the values of the roughness

coupling of dimension five, $\lambda_W^{(\nu*)}/m_{\nu*}$, among the excited

Majorana neutrino. If the coupling is not small, i.e., $\lambda_W^{(\nu*)}>1$
the mass of the excited neutrino must not be gless than the $Z$ boson mass,
$m_Z$. Since $\nu^*$ contributes in the $(\b\b)_{0\nu}$ decay as a vertual

region of $\nu^*$.

the mass of the excited neutrino. By comparing the recent data for ${}^{76}$Ge,

$\lambda_W^{(\nu*)}/m_{\nu*}=f/(\sqrt 2 \Lambda)$ where $f$ is the relative
strength of gauge couplings. Then, we obtain $\Lambda > 170 f (m_N/{1\rm

velocity larger than the phase velocity of light emit photons by the Cerenkov
process. The Cerenkov radiation is a helicity flip process via which a
left-handed neutrino in a supernova core may change into a sterile right-handed
one and free-stream out of the core. Assuming that the luminosity of such
sterile right-handed neutrinos is less than $10^{53}$ ergs/sec gives an upper
bound on the neutrino magnetic dipole moment $\mu_\nu < 0.2 \times 10^{-13}
\mu_B$. This is two orders of magnitude more stringent than the previously
established bounds on $\mu_\nu$ from considerations of supernova cooling rate
by right-handed neutrinos.

of its lifetime by a low-energy effective theory defined on a suitably chosen
set of smooth spacelike hypersurfaces. The conventional argument for
information loss rests on the assumption that the effective theory is a local
quantum field theory. We present evidence that this assumption fails in the
context of string theory. The commutator of operators in light-front string
theory, corresponding to certain low-energy observers on opposite sides of the
event horizon, remains large even when these observers are spacelike separated
by a macroscopic distance. This suggests that degrees of freedom inside a black
hole should not be viewed as independent from those outside the event horizon.
These nonlocal effects are only significant under extreme kinematic
circumstances, such as in the high-redshift geometry of a black hole.
Commutators of space-like separated operators corresponding to ordinary
low-energy observers in Minkowski space are strongly suppressed in string
theory.

efficient way than conventional inflationary backgrounds, because the
perturbation amplitude may grow - instead of being constant - outside the
horizon. If not gauged away, the growing mode can limit the range of validity
of a linearized description of perturbations. Even in the restricted linear
range, however, this enhanced amplification may lead to phenomenological
consequences unexpected in the context of the standard inflationary scenario.
In particular, the production of a relic graviton background strong enough to
be detected in future by LIGO, and/or the generation of a stochastic
electromagnetic background strong enough to seed the cosmic magnetic fields and
to be responsible for the observed large scale anisotropy.

(\log|x|)^2 $, with $\ep=(T-T_c)$. However, renormalization group computations
predict $B\not=0$ while variational approaches (which are supposed to be exact
for models with a large number of components) give $B=0$. We introduce a large
$N$ version of the random phase sine-Gordon model. Using non-Abelian
bosonization and renormalization group techniques, we show that the correlation

fundamentally incorrect. It has been replaced at the basic level by a radically
different theory: quantum mechanics. This change entails an enormous shift in

image of man himself. Self-image is the foundation of values, and the
replacement of the mechanistic self-image derived from classical mechanics by
one concordant with quantum mechanics may provide the foundation of a moral
order better suited to our times, a self-image that endows human life with
meaning, responsibility, and a deeper linkage to nature as a whole.
