redshift ($z<0.3$) QSOs by cross-correlating the positions on the sky of
X-ray-selected QSOs/AGN identified in the {\it Einstein} Medium Sensitivity
Survey (EMSS) with those of $B_J<20.5$ galaxies in the APM galaxy catalogues.
At $<5\,$arcmin, we find a significant ($5\sigma$) galaxy excess around $z<0.3$
QSOs. The amplitude of the low redshift ($z<0.3$) QSO-galaxy angular
cross-correlation function is identical to that of the APM galaxy angular
correlation function, implying that these (predominantly radio-quiet) QSOs
inhabit environments similar to those of normal galaxies. No significant galaxy
excess was found around a `control' sample of $z>0.3$ QSOs. Coupled with
previous observations, these results imply that the environment of radio-quiet
QSOs undergoes little evolution over a wide range in redshift ($0 less than z
less than 1.5$). This is in marked contrast to the rapid increase in the
richness of the environments associated with radio-loud QSOs over the same
redshift range. The similarity between QSO-galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy
clustering also suggests that QSOs are unbiased with respect to galaxies and
make useful tracers of large-scale structure in the Universe.

describe the representation space as the space of oriented loops and curves;
then configurational and momentum loop variables become in this basis the
operators of creation and annihilation of loops and curves. The important
difference of the representation constructed from the loop representation of

joining loops in the only compatible with their orientaiton way, while in the
