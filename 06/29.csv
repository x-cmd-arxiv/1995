  script uufiles; to appear in the September Astronomical Journal",,"10.1086/117585",,"astro-ph",,"  Using single channel infrared photometry from the literature, a provisional
K-band diameter--velocity dispersion relation for elliptical galaxies in the
Coma and Virgo clusters is derived. The Coma cluster relation has \~1.5 times
lower scatter at K than in B or V. Excluding 4 outliers, the RMS scatter at K
for 24 galaxies in Coma is only 4.8% in distance, close to the limit implied by
the observational errors. Distance estimates based on the IR \Dsig relation
will be more accurate than those derived from optical data. The improvement in
the infrared is attributed to a decrease in sensitivity to stellar population
parameters (age, metallicity, and slope of the IMF) as well as lower internal
extinction from dust compared to the optical. That the \Dsig relation has a
larger scatter in the optical indicates that there are detectable, but small,
stellar population or dust content differences among the Coma ellipticals.
Since the \Dsig relations are based on the fundamental plane, this result
promises that the fundamental plane is thinner in the infrared than it is in
the optical.
  Infrared photometric data available for Virgo are limited to just 13 objects;
the spread in distance due to the depth of the cluster precludes any
significant improvement over B and V. A relative Coma-Virgo distance of 5.56 is
derived from the K band data, in agreement with estimates in other colors and
using other techniques, indicating that there is no significant age difference
between Virgo and Coma ellipticals.

the galactic center source Sgr A*. By comparing the ``disk'' and radio core
luminosity of those galactic jet sources with our model prediction we can show
that they can easily be understood as AGN-like jets where the accretion power
onto a central compact object is scaled down by several orders of magnitude.
The total power of the jets must be comparable to the disk luminosity - at
least for the superluminal sources. To broaden our view we also shortly discuss
the situation in other galactic flat spectrum radio source associated with
compact objects -- the X-ray binaries Cyg X-1, Cyg X-2, Cyg X-3 and Sco X-1 --
where a jet origin has been proposed earlier on theoretical grounds. In an
disk/radio luminosity their radio cores also fall within our model prediction
for scaled down radio loud and radio weak AGN-jets. Taking all sources together
and comparing their L_disk/radio ratio we find an indication for a similar
radio loud/radio weak dichotomy as found earlier for quasar radio cores,
however, a larger number of galactic jet sources is needed to confirm this

decreases and the spins are allowed to soften, we are able to demonstrate the

secondary constraint quadratic in the momenta. This paper studies in detail the
same problem at a Lagrangian level, i.e. working on the tangent bundle rather
than on phase space. The corresponding analysis is motivated by a more general
program, aiming to obtain a manifestly covariant, multisymplectic framework for
the analysis of relativistic theories of gravitation regarded as constrained
systems. After an application of the Gotay-Nester Lagrangian analysis, the
paper deals with the generalized method, which has the advantage of being
applicable to any system of differential equations in implicit form.
Multiplication of the second-order Lagrange equations by a vector with zero
eigenvalue for the Hessian matrix yields the so-called first-generation
constraints. Remarkably, in the cosmological model here considered, if Lagrange
equations are studied using second-order formalism, a second-generation
constraint is found which is absent in first-order formalism. This happens
since first- and second-order formalisms are inequivalent. There are, however,
no {\it a priori} reasons for arguing that one of the two is incorrect. First-
and second-generation constraints are used to derive physical predictions for
the cosmological model.

theory is diagonally embedded into that of the two-dimensional heterotic string
theory. Consequently, the embedded string backgrounds satisfy the
(electro-magnetic) Ernst equation. In the pure Einstein theory, the
Matzner-Misner SL(2,{\bf R}) transformation can be viewed as a change of
conformal structure of the compactified flat two-torus, and in particular its
integral subgroup SL(2,{\bf Z}) acts as the modular transformation. The Ehlers
SL(2,{\bf R}) and SL(2,{\bf Z}) similarly act on another torus whose conformal
structure is induced through the Kramer-Neugebauer involution. Either of the
Matzner-Misner and the Ehlers SL(2,{\bf Z}) can be embedded to a special
T-duality, and if the former is chosen, then the Ehlers SL(2,{\bf Z}) is shown
to act as the S-duality on the four-dimensional sector. As an application we
obtain some new colliding string wave solutions by using this embedding as well
as the inverse scattering method.

implicated in controlling {\it structural} selectivity in compounds and alloys.
Here we show that spin-polarized electronic structure calculations are crucial
for predicting the correct $T=0$ crystal structures for Pd$_3X$ and Pt$_3X$
compounds. Spin-polarization leads to (i) stabilization of the $L1_2$ structure
over the $DO_{22}$ structure in Pt$_3$Cr, Pd$_3$Cr, and Pd$_3$Mn, (ii) to the
stabilization of the $DO_{22}$ structure over the $L1_2$ structure in Pd$_3$Co
and to (iii) ordering (rather than phase-separation) in Pt$_3$Co and Pd$_3$Cr.
The results are analyzed in terms of first-principles local spin density
calculations.

off-shell pion. The framework of chiral perturbation theory is used to
illustrate the representation dependence of the electromagnetic three-point
Green's function. For that purpose we discuss the concept of field
transformations which, in comparison with the standard Gasser and Leutwyler
Lagrangian, generate equivalent Lagrangians containing additional terms at
order p^4 proportional to the lowest-order equation of motion. We consider
Compton scattering from a pion to show that calculations involving different
off-shell effects in the s- and u-channel pole diagrams may nevertheless lead
to the same on-shell Compton scattering amplitude. This is a result of the
equivalence theorem which states that two equivalent Lagrangians predict the
same S-matrix elements even though they may generate a different off-shell
behaviour of Green's functions. We conclude that off-shell effects are not only
model dependent but also representation dependent.
