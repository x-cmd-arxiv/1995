homogeneous universe with $\Omega > 1$ may appear due to creation of the

very steep at large $\phi$, or in the theories where the inflaton field $\phi$
nonminimally couples to gravity. Inflation with $\Omega < 1$ generally requires
intermediate first order phase transition with the bubble formation, and with a
second stage of inflation inside the bubble. It is possible to realize this
scenario in the context of a theory of one scalar field, but typically it
requires artificially bent effective potentials and/or nonminimal kinetic
terms. It is much easier to obtain an open universe in the models involving two
scalar fields. However, these models have their own specific problems. We
propose three different models of this type which can describe an open
homogeneous inflationary universe.

inconsistent results about relaxation time; some initial state relaxed in the

N^2\,t_c$, where $t_c$ is the crossing time. The water-bag distribution was
believed not to relax after $T\sim N^2\,t_c$. In our previous paper, however,
we found there are two different relaxation times in the water-bag
distribution;in the faster relaxation ( microscopic relaxation ) the
equipartition of energy distribution is attains but the macroscopic
distribution turns into the isothermal distribution in the later relaxation
(macroscopic relaxation). In this paper, we investigated the properties of the
two relaxation. We found that the microscopic relaxation time is $T\sim
N\,t_c$, and the macroscopic relaxation time is proportional to $N\,t_c$, thus
the water-bag does relax. We can see the inconsistency about the relaxation
times is resolved as that we see the two different aspect of relaxations.
Further, the physical mechanisms of the relaxations are presented.

A3558 which is part of the core of the Shapley Concentration. The X-ray
brightness distribution can be fitted as the sum of an elliptical King law,
with a major core radius of about 0.20 Mpc and an axial ratio 0.72, and a
Gaussian central source associated with the cD galaxy. Among the several
discrete sources present in the field, two correspond to the poor clusters SC
1327-312 and SC 1329-313, at about the same redshift as A3558, and two other
sources are identified with bright galaxies, which are also part of the core of
the Shapley Concentration. There is also evidence of an enhanced diffuse X-ray
emission which connects the outer part of A3558 with SC 1327-312. From the
spectral analysis, we find that the temperature profile of A3558 is consistent
with an isothermal distribution at kT=3.25 keV, while the cD galaxy has the
lower temperature kT=1.89 keV. For the cluster we derive a luminosity L_X = 1.1
X 10^44 erg/s, within a radius of 0.8 Mpc and a total mass M_tot = 3.1 X 10^14
M_\odot within an Abell radius. In the same region the gas mass is about 20% of
the total mass and there are evidences for the hot gas to be less centrally
concentrated than the dark matter and the stellar component. For h=1 most of
the dynamical mass is in dark matter, while for h=0.5 most of the mass is in
hot gas. In both cases, the stellar mass appears to be a good tracer of the
total mass distribution. Under the hypothesis that the central density spike
represents a cooling flow, we derive a mass deposition rate of 25 M_\odot/yrs.
The single physical parameters derived for A3558 show a general agreement with
the typical values found for other X-ray emitting clusters, but the
correlations between these quantities show some peculiarities, probably due to
