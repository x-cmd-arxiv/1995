  Accepted for publication, ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/309647","Caltech Theoretical Astrophysics GRP-405","astro-ph",,"  We present faint galaxy counts from deep $VRI$ images obtained with the Keck
Telescope. These images reach $R\sim27$ in median seeing FWHM $\sim 0.5$--0.6
arcsec and we detect a integrated galaxy number density of $7\times 10^{5}$
degree$^{-2}$, equivalent to $3\times 10^{10}$ galaxies in the observable
Universe. In addition we present median galaxy colors as a function of
magnitude; bluing trends are visible in all colors to $R\sim 24.5$. Fainter
than $R\sim24.5$, however, the typical \VR\ color becomes redder again, \VI\
remains constant, and \RI\ becomes yet bluer. These trends are consistent with
the $VRI$ count slopes, implying a decrease in the $V$ slope at the faintest
levels, which our data supports. Taking advantage of our good seeing we also
present median half-light radii for faint galaxies, these show a steady decline
at fainter magnitudes, leading to an intrinsic half-light radius of $\sim 0.2$
arcsec for a typical $R\sim25.5$--26 galaxy. Irrespective of the redshift
distribution, the extremely high galaxy surface densities and their small
intrinsic sizes are consistent with a scenario in which the majority of the
very faint field population are dwarf galaxies or sub-galactic units.

in a unified way the X-ray spectra and rapid X-ray variability of the so-called
Z sources and other accreting neutron stars in low-mass systems. Here we
summarize the results of detailed numerical calculations of the X-ray spectra
of the Z sources predicted by this model. Our computations show that in the Z
sources, photons are produced primarily by electron cyclotron emission in the
neutron star magnetosphere. Comptonization of these photons by the hot central
corona and radial inflow produces X-ray spectra, color-color tracks, and
countrate variations like those observed in the Z sources.

In the special case of $S=1/2$, the new algorithm can be viewed as a cluster
algorithm for the 8-vertex model. As an example, we study the $S=1/2$ $XY$
model in two dimensions with a representation in which the quantization axis
lies in the easy plane. We find that the numerical autocorrelation time for the
cluster algorithm remains of the order of unity and does not show any
significant dependence on the temperature, the system size, or the Trotter
number. On the other hand, the autocorrelation time for the conventional
algorithm strongly depends on these parameters and can be very large. The use
of improved estimators for thermodynamic averages further enhances the
efficiency of the new algorithms.

One-loop computation that the Hall conductivity does indeed get quantized at

physical picture for the non-analytic nature of the wave functions, and shown
that quantum fluctuations restore the Kohn mode.

breaking as well as in the left-right symmetric model, there are new observable
contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay arising from hitherto
overlooked diagrams involving the exchange of one W boson and one scalar boson.
In particular, in the case of MSSM, the present experimental bounds on
neutrinoless double beta decay lifetime improves the limits on certain R-parity
violating couplings by about two orders of magnitude. It is shown that similar
diagrams also lead to enhanced rates for $\mu^-\rightarrow e^+$ conversion in
nuclei, which are in the range accessible to ongoing experiments.
