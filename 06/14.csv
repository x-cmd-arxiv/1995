and likely significantly effects $z<1$ galaxies. A ``maximum reasonable rate''
model for merging finds a $\sim2$ mag K band increase in the luminosities of
dwarf galaxies so that they contribute significantly to the faint counts, with
spirals and ellipticals being far less affected. The median $K$ and $I$
redshifts stabilize (and even decrease slightly) at $z\simeq0.6$ beyond I=21 or
K=19. The B redshifts continue to rise (although strongly dependent on the UV
spectral evolution). Such rapid merging predicts that at $z=1$ the
characteristic galaxy mass is reduced to $\sim30\%$ of the $z=0$ value. To rule
out this model requires good sampling beyond $z=1$.
  A theoretical complication for even a minimal merger rate, which reduces
$z=1$ masses to 2/3 of current epoch values, is that infall of a single
satellite having 10\% of a disk's mass may destroy thin disks. Using completely
self-consistent n-body simulations, we show that the primary response of a disk
to ``cosmological'' satellites up to 20\% of the disk mass is to {\em tilt} the
disk with a temporary warping.

Confirming the results of Fabian et al. (1994), we find definite evidence for

absorber and a doubling of the warm absorber column density within the 3 weeks
separating the two observations. No intra-day {\it flux-correlated} variability
of the warm absorber is found. However, we report the discovery of an `event'
in which the warm absorber parameters temporarily change for
\sim10\,000\thinspace s before returning to their original values. Possible
interpretations are discussed but a contradiction remains: the constancy of the
ionization state of the warm absorber argues that it lies at large distances
from the central source whereas the short term change in column density argues
for small distances. Fluorescent iron emission is examined. As found by Fabian
et al. (1994), the iron line is broad and strong (equivalent width
\sim300\thinspace eV). The line profile is also suggestive of it being skewed.
Such a line would be expected from a relativistic accretion disk. We also find
very rapid primary X-ray variability. Assuming relativistic beaming to be
unimportant, the derived efficiency is comparable to the maximum obtainable
from accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole. Correlated variability outside
of the energy range of {\it ASCA} might exceed this maximum, thus requiring
efficient accretion onto a Kerr hole.

samples. The learning paradigm builds increasingly complex fields by allowing
potential functions, or features, that are supported by increasingly large
subgraphs. Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and the empirical distribution of
the training data. A greedy algorithm determines how features are incrementally
added to the field and an iterative scaling algorithm is used to estimate the
optimal values of the weights.
  The statistical modeling techniques introduced in this paper differ from
those common to much of the natural language processing literature since there
is no probabilistic finite state or push-down automaton on which the model is
built. Our approach also differs from the techniques common to the computer
vision literature in that the underlying random fields are non-Markovian and
have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations to other
learning approaches including decision trees and Boltzmann machines are given.
As a demonstration of the method, we describe its application to the problem of
automatic word classification in natural language processing.

treated properly. This approach consists of processing an on-line dictionary
multiple times, each time refining the lexical information previously acquired

lexical information can be acquired from definitions which are syntactically
ambiguous, given that information acquired during the first pass can be used to
improve the syntactic analysis of definitions in subsequent passes. In the
context of a lexical knowledge base, the types of lexical information that need
to be represented cannot be viewed as a fixed set, but rather as a set that
will change given the resources of the lexical knowledge base and the

homogeneous nucleation of vortex-antivortex pairs in a 2-D like superconductor

force are present is treated exactly, taking the vortex activation energy and
its inertial mass as independent parameters. Quantum dissipation is included
through the Caldeira and Leggett formulation. Its most relevant consequence is
the elimination of the threshold for vortex production due to the Magnus force.
In the dissipation-dominated case, formally the limit of zero inertial mass, an
exact formula for the pair production rate is given. If however the inertial
mass is strictly zero we find that vortex production is inhibited by a quantum
effect related to the Magnus force. The possibility of vortex pinning is
investigated by means of an effective harmonic potential. While an additional
term in the activation energy can account for the effect of a finite barrier in
the direction perpendicular to the current, pinning along the current depresses
the role of the Magnus force in the dissipation-dominated dynamics, except for
the above-mentioned quantum effect. A possible description of vortex nucleation
due to the combined effects of temperature and externally-driven currents is
also presented along with an evaluation of the resulting voltage drop.

singularities. Here we consider the generalization to arbitrary
quasi-homogeneous singularities at $c=9$. We use mirror symmetry to derive the
dependence of the models on the complexified K\""ahler moduli and check the
expansions of some topological correlation functions against explicit genus
zero and genus one instanton calculations. As an important application we give
examples of how non-algebraic (``twisted'') deformations can be mapped to
algebraic ones, hence allowing us to study the full moduli space. We also study
how moduli spaces can be nested in each other, thus enabling a (singular)
transition from one theory to another. Following the recent work of Greene,
Morrison and Strominger we show that this corresponds to black hole
condensation in type II string theories compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds.
