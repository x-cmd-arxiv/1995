difficult to show that the universe is radially homogeneous (independent of
distance), or equivalently, that it is isotropic about distant points. This
taken as an axiom, since if it were not true, then we would occupy a preferred
position. This paper considers several empirical arguments for radial
homogeneity based on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The tightest limits
on inhomogeneity on the scale of the horizon are of order ten percent but will
improve soon. These limits involve the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters of
galaxies, excitation of low-energy atomic transitions, and the accurately
thermal spectrum of the CMB. Weaker limits from primordial nucleosynthesis are
discussed briefly.

(GCLF) and the use of this function as an extragalactic distance indicator.
Previous studies have found an offset between GCLF distances and those obtained
with other techniques. We show that this offset can be understood in terms of a
metallicity effect. Specifically, the globular cluster systems used in distance
scale studies have traditionally been those around elliptical galaxies. These
systems have higher mean metallicities than the Milky Way globular cluster
system. Consequently, the peak of the GCLF in the systems around ellipticals is
significantly fainter in $B$ and $V$ than the GCLF peak in the Milky Way. We
calculate the shift in the peak of the GCLF relative to the Milky Way globulars
in $B$, $V$, $R$, $I$ and $J$ for a range of globular cluster metallicities.
Applying these corrections, we find good agreement between GCLF distances and
those obtained using the surface brightness fluctuations method. The similarity
between metallicity-corrected GCLFs suggests that the underlying mass function
of globular cluster systems is remarkably constant from one galaxy to another.
Our results allow the GCLF to be employed as an improved distance indicator.

significantly from scale-invariance, thus improving the fit to large-scale

quadratic divergences reminiscent of the ones found in the renormalization of

proportionality is a fairly immediate consequence of basic principles -- a
low-energy theorem. Thus in this framework renormalizing the Newton constant
renders the entropy finite, and equal to its semiclassical value. As a partial
check on our formal arguments we compare the one loop determinants, calculated
using heat kernel regularization. An alternative definition of black hole
entropy relates it to behavior at conical singularities in two dimensions, and
thus to a suitable definition of geometric entropy. Geometric entropy permits
the same renormalization, but it does not yield an intrinsically positive
quantity. For scalar fields geometric entropy is subtly sensitive to curved
space couplings, even in the limit of flat space. Fermions and gauge fields are
considered as well. Their functional determinants are closely related to the
determinants for non-minimally coupled scalar fields with specific values for
the curvature coupling, and pose no further difficulties.

finite $XXZ$ $(\Delta>1)$ chain in a boundary magnetic field $h$. Boundary
bound states are represented by the ``boundary strings'' similar to those
described in the work of H.Saleur, S.Skorik. We find that for certain values of
$h$ the ground state wave function contains boundary strings, and from this
infer the existence of two ``critical'' fields in agreement with the results of
Jimbo et al. An expression for the vacuum surface energy in the thermodynamic
limit is derived and found to be an analytic function of $h$. We argue that
boundary excitations appear only in pairs with ``bulk'' excitations or with
boundary excitations at the other end of the chain. We mainly discuss the case
where the magnetic fields at the left and the right boundaries are
antiparallel, but we also comment on the case of the parallel fields. In the
Ising ($\Delta=\infty$) and isotropic ($\Delta=1$) limits our results agree
with those previously known.

the model is not integrable, while it still posesses many properties of
integrable systems (such as stable ``numerical'' solitons).

is shown to agree with a general index theorem. A previous observation in the
literature, that the presence of induced vacuum quantum numbers which are not
periodic in the flux make an integral-flux AB string visible, is reinforced. In
the second part, a recent discussion of chiral symmetry breaking by external
magnetic fields in parity invariant QED$_3$ and its relation to the induced
spin in parity non-invariant QED$_3$ is further elaborated. Finally other
vacuum polarisation effects around flux tubes in different variants of QED, in
three and four dimensions are mentioned.

Given a collection of $m$ finite factorizable sheaves $\{\CX_k\}$, we construct
here some perverse sheaves over configuration spaces of points on a projective
line $\BP^1$ with $m$ additional marked points. We announce here (with sketch
proof) the computation of the cohomology spaces of these sheaves. They turn out
to coincide with certain ""semiinfinite"" $\Tor$ spaces of the corresponding
$\fu$-modules. As a corollary, we get a description of local systems of
conformal blocks in WZW models in genus $0$ (cf. ~\cite{ms}) as natural
subquotients of some semisimple local systems of geometric origin. In
particular, these local systems are semisimple themselves.

given pde, using the sine-Gordon equation as a typical example for a
non-evolution equation. For non-evolution equations, Estabrook-Wahlquist
prolongation structures for non-local symmetries depend on the choice of a
specific sub-ideal, of the contact module, to define the pde. For each
inequivalent such choice we determine the most general solution of the
prolongation equations, as sub-algebras of the (infinite-dimensional) algebra
of all vector fields over the space of non-local variables associated with the
pde, in the style of Vinogradov covering spaces. We show explicitly how
previously-known prolongation structures, known to lie within the Kac-Moody
algebra, $A_1^{(1)}$, are special cases of these general solutions, although we
are unable to identify the most general solutions with previously-studied
algebras. We show the existence of gauge transformations between prolongation
structures, viewed as determining connections over the solution space, and use
these to relate (otherwise) distinct algebras. Faithful realizations of the
universal algebra allow integral representations of the prolongation structure,
opening up interesting connections with algebras of Toeplitz operators over
Banach spaces, an area that has only begun to be explored.
