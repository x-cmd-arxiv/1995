functions and microwave background anisotropy for cosmological models, and for
generating gaussian random initial conditions for nonlinear structure formation
simulations of such models. Four programs are provided: {\bf linger\_con} and
{\bf linger\_syn} integrate the linearized equations of general relativity,
matter, and radiation in conformal Newtonian and synchronous gauge,
respectively; {\bf deltat} integrates the photon transfer functions computed by
the linger codes to produce photon anisotropy power spectra; and {\bf grafic}
tabulates normalized matter power spectra and produces constrained or
unconstrained samples of the matter density field.
  Version 1.0 of COSMICS is available at http://arcturus.mit.edu/cosmics/ . The
current release gives fortran-77 programs that run on workstations and
vectorized supercomputers. Unix makefiles are included that make it simple to
build and test the package. A future release will include portable parallel
versions of the linger codes using standard message-passing libraries.

Newtonian (or longitudinal) gauge. It differs from others in the literature in
that we give, in both gauges, a complete discussion of all particle species
that are relevant to any flat cold dark matter (CDM), hot dark matter (HDM), or
CDM+HDM models (including a possible cosmological constant). The particles
considered include CDM, baryons, photons, massless neutrinos, and massive
neutrinos (an HDM candidate), where the CDM and baryons are treated as fluids
while a detailed phase-space description is given to the photons and neutrinos.
Particular care is applied to the massive neutrino component, which has been
either ignored or approximated crudely in previous works. Isentropic initial
conditions on super-horizon scales are derived. The coupled, linearized
Boltzmann, Einstein and fluid equations that govern the evolution of the metric
and density perturbations are then solved numerically in both gauges for the
standard CDM model and two CDM+HDM models with neutrino mass densities
$\onu=0.2$ and 0.3, assuming a scale-invariant, adiabatic spectrum of
primordial fluctuations. We also give the full details of the cosmic microwave
background anisotropy, and present the first accurate calculations of the
angular power spectra in the two CDM+HDM models including photon polarization,
higher neutrino multipole moments, and helium recombination. The numerical
programs for both gauges are available at http://arcturus.mit.edu/cosmics/ .

of a 0.2 Jy sample by Rowan-Robinson and collaborators in 1991, is
significantly more luminous than any other known galaxy. Its bolometric
luminosity is comparable to those of the most luminous quasars. Recent
obsservations have revealed a candidate foreground group of galaxies, which
might gravitationally lens F10214+4724, thus explaining much of its luminosity.
High-resolution imaging of F10214+4724 has revealed that most of its near-IR
flux comes from a circularly symmetric arc; this also supports the
gravitational lens interpretation. In such a scenario, F10214+4724 would be the
high-redshift analogue of the ultraluminous IRAS galaxies observed locally.
This work presents a simple statistical lensing model to investigate this
possibility.

Assuming that the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy is determined by the

baryonic mass, this scatter translates to a minimum intrinsic scatter in the
Tully-Fisher relation. For popular cosmological models we find that the scatter
due to variations in formation histories is by itself greater than allowed by
observations. Unless halos of spiral galaxies formed at high redshift (z>1) and
did not later accrete any significant amount of mass, the Tully-Fisher relation
is not likely to be the direct result of cosmological initial conditions but

for G, the the open orbits D of a (connected) real form G_0 of G form an
interesting class of complex homogeneous spaces, which play an important role
in the representation theory of G_0. We find that the group of automorphisms,
i.e., the holomorphic diffeomorphisms, is a finite-dimensional Lie group,
except for a small number of open orbits, where it is infinite dimensional. In
the finite-dimensional case, we determine its structure. Our results have some
consequences in representation theory.

invariant \lambda(Y) is roughly defined by measuring the oriented number of
irreducible representations of the fundamental group \pi_1(Y) in SU(2). Such an
invariant generalized the Rohlin invariant and gives surprising corollaries in
low dimensional topology.

computation of the surgery equivalence classes of pure braids. We show that the
order of any invariant, in Ohtsukis sense, is a multiple of 3. We also study
the relation between the order of an invariant and that of the knot invariant

"q-alg/9506013","Donin Joseph","J.Donin and S.Shnider","Cohomological construction of quantized universal enveloping algebras","amslatex, 33 pp",,,,"q-alg math.QA",,"  Given an associative algebra $A$, and the category, $\cC$, of its finite
dimensional modules, additional structures on the algebra $A$ induce
corresponding ones on the category $\cC$. Thus, the structure of a rigid
quasi-tensor (braided monoidal) category on $Rep_A$ is induced by an algebra
homomorphism $A\to A\otimes A$ (comultiplication), coassociative up to
conjugation by $\Phi\in A^{\otimes 3}$ (associativity constraint) and
cocommutative up to conjugation by $\cR\in A^{\otimes 2}$ (commutativity
constraint), together with an antiautomorphism (antipode), $S$, of $A$
satisfying the certain compatibility conditions. A morphism of quasi-tensor
structures is given by an element $F\in A^{\otimes 2}$ with suitable induced
actions on $\Phi$, $\cR$ and $S$. Drinfeld defined such a structure on
$A=U(\cG)[[h]]$ for any semisimple Lie algebra $\cG$ with the usual
comultiplication and antipode but nontrivial $\cR$ and $\Phi$ and proved that
the corresponding quasi-tensor category is isomomorphic to the category of
representations of the Drinfeld-Jimbo (DJ) quantum universal enveloping algebra
(QUE), $U_h(\cG)$.
  In the paper we give a direct cohomological construction of the $F$ which
reduces $\Phi$ to the trivial associativity constraint, without any assumption
on the prior existence of a strictly coassociative QUE. Thus we get a new
approach to the DJ quantization. We prove that $F$ can be chosen to satisfy
some additional invariance conditions under (anti)automorphisms of
$U(\cG)[[h]]$, in particular, $F$ gives an isomorphism of rigid quasi-tensor
categories. Moreover, we prove that for pure imaginary values of the
deformation parameter, the elements $F$, $R$ and $\Phi$ can be chosen to be
