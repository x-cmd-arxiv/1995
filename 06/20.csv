source of cosmic rays in two regions of the observed spectrum: 1. At the
very-high-energy end (E>10^{19} eV), where cosmic rays must be of extragalactic
origin. 2. Around and above the spectral feature that has been described as a
bump and/or a knee, which occurs around 10^{15} eV, and starts at about 10^{14}
eV. The occasional bursters that occur inside the Galaxy--about once in a few
hundred thousand years if burst emission is isotropic; more often, if it is
beamed--could maintain the density of galactic cosmic rays at the observed
level in this range. These two energy ranges might correspond to two typical
energy scales expected from bursters: one pertinent to acceleration due to
interaction of a magnetized-fireball front with an ambient medium; the other to
acceleration in the fireball itself (e.g. shock acceleration).

standard result that the density must be sub-critical relies on the assumption
that the galaxy three-point correlation function accurately describes the mass
distribution around a typical pair of galaxies. To challenge this assumption,
we develop a simple model of this mass distribution based on the extension of
galactic halos. In such a model, one sees clearly the importance of the local
mass distribution around pairs to the prediction of the galaxy pair-wise
velocity dispersion. The model provides insight into the mechanics of the
theorem and demonstrates that a flat universe is {\it consistent} with the
observations. More generally, we conclude that the relative pair-wise velocity
dispersion probes the mass clustered around galaxies and that the observations,
viewed in this light, indicate a lower bound of $\sim 300\; h^{-1}$kpc on the
radius of galactic halos.

of the source by a companion through the first detection of shift in the light

of $0.3^{\prime\prime}$ on the separation between the stars. The best lens
model obtained requires moderate blending, which was what motivated us to check
the centroid shift that was subsequently found. The best lens model predicts a
separation of $1^{\prime\prime}$ between the two blended stars. This prediction
was recently tested using two CCD images taken under good seeing conditions.
Both images show two components. Their separation and position angle are in

more than 25\% of the massive dark halo is made up of M dwarfs or subdwarfs;
fairly massive ($M \sim 0.2 M_\odot$) and yet extremely faint ($M_I$ \gtsima

White dwarfs must also be intrinsically very faint ($M_I$ \gtsima $14$) in

extrapolated to the continuum limit. We find a deviation from ideal gas

Lie algebra the hierarchies here considered are integrable and essentially
dependent on continuous free parameters. The bosonic hierarchies studied in

symmetric-spaces.\par In the supersymmetric case the homogeneous grading is
introduced consistently by using alternating sums of bosons and fermions in the
spectral parameter power series.\par The bosonic hierarchies obtained from

bosonic hierarchies can be supersymmetrically extended while preserving
integrability.

temperatures below 250 eV for ITER and below 150 eV for present experiments. We
have calculated the radiated power loss using a collisional radiative model for
Be, B, C, Ne and Ar using a multiple configuration interaction model which
includes density dependent effects, as well as a very detailed treatment of the
energy levels and meta-stable levels. The ""collisional radiative"" effects are
very important for Be at temperatures below 10 eV. The same effects are present
for higher Z impurities, but not as strongly. For some of the lower Z elements,
the new rates are about a factor of two lower than those from a widely used,
simpler average-ion package (ADPAK) developed for high Z ions and for higher
temperatures. Following the approach of Lengyel for the case where electron
heat conduction is the dominant mechanism for heat transport along field lines,
our analysis indicates that significant enhancements of the radiation losses
above collisional radiative model rates due to such effects as rapid recycling
and charge exchange recombination will be necessary for impurity radiation to
reduce the peak heat loads on divertor plates for high heat flux experiments
such as ITER.

from the ADPAK code package, we have developed criteria for the required
impurity fraction, impurity species, connection length and electron temperature

impurity radiation from coronal equilibrium rates is, in general, not adequate
to exhaust the highest expected heating powers in present and future
experiments. As suggested by others, we examine the effects of enhancing the
radiation rates with charge exchange recombination and impurity recycling, and
develop criteria for the minimum neutral fraction and impurity recycling rate
that is required to exhaust a specified power. We also use this criteria to
find the optimum impurity for divertor power exhaust.

for the success of the next generation of high fusion power tokamaks such as
the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) 1 . Many present
concepts for accomplishing this involve the use of atomic processes to transfer
the heat from the plasma to the main chamber and divertor chamber walls and
much of the experimental and theoretical physics research in the fusion program
is directed toward this issue. The results of these experiments and
calculations are the result of a complex interplay of many processes. In order
to identify the key features of these experiments and calculations and the
relative role of the primary atomic processes, simple quasi-analytic models and
the latest atomic physics rate coefficients and cross sections have been used
to assess the relative roles of central radiation losses through
bremsstrahlung, impurity radiation losses from the plasma edge, charge exchange
and hydrogen radiation losses from the scrape-off layer and divertor plasma and
impurity radiation losses from the divertor plasma. This anaysis indicates that
bremsstrahlung from the plasma center and impurity radiation from the plasma
edge and divertor plasma can each play a significant role in reducing the power
to the divertor plates, and identifies many of the factors which determine the
relative role of each process. For instance, for radiation losses in the
divertor to be large enough to radiate the power in the divertor for high power
experiments, a neutral fraction of 10-3 to 10-2 and an impurity recycling rate
of netrecycle of ~ 10^16 s m^-3 will be required in the divertor.
