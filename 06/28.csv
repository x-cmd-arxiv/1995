law for toric residues. When the fan of the toric variety has a simplicial cone
of maximal dimension, we can produce an element with toric residue equal to 1.
We also show that in certain situations, the toric residue is an isomorphism on
an appropriate graded piece of the quotient ring. When X is simplicial, we
prove that the toric residue is a sum of local residues. In the case of equal
degrees, we also show how to represent X as a quotient (Y-{0})/C* such that the
toric residue becomes the local residue at 0 in Y.

therein), quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and related active galactic nuclei (AGN)
phenomena are explained as the result of accretion of plasma onto giant black
holes which are postulated to form via gravitational collapse of the high
density regions in the centers of massive host galaxies. This model is
supported by a wide variety of indirect evidence and seems quite likely to
apply at least to some observed AGN phenomena. However, one surprising set of
new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations [2-4] directly challenges the
conventional model, and the well known evolution of the QSO population raises
some additional, though not widely recognized, difficulties. We propose here an
alternative possibility: the Universe contains a substantial independent
population of super-massive black holes, and QSO's are a phenomenon that occurs
due to their collisions with galaxies or gas clouds in the intergalactic medium
(IGM). This hypothesis would naturally explain why the QSO population declines
very rapidly towards low redshift, as well as the new HST data.

other wavebands has sparked much interest in these sources. One of the recent
models for these objects is that they originate in the environs of neutron
stars with fields much stronger than the quantum critical field
\teq{B_{cr}=4.413\times 10^{13}} Gauss. Near such neutron stars, dubbed
magnetars, the exotic quantum process of magnetic photon splitting becomes
prolific. Its principal effect is to degrade photon energies and thereby soften
gamma-ray spectra from neutron stars; it has recently been suggested that
splitting may be responsible for limiting the hardness of emission in SGRs, if
these sources originate in neutron stars with supercritical surface fields.
Seed photons in supercritical fields efficiently generate soft gamma-ray
spectra, typical of repeaters. In this paper, the influence of the curved
dipole field geometry of a neutron star magnetosphere on the photon splitting
rate is investigated. The dependence of the attenuation length on the location
and angular direction of the seed photons is explored.

strongly on $v$. $Q(r,u,v)$ is about 0.2 at $v=0.1$ and 1.8 at $v=0.9$. A model
of $Q(r,u,v)=\Theta 10^{1.3v^2}$ can fit the data of $\zeta$ very nicely with
$\Theta\approx 0.14$. This model is found to be universal for the LCDM clusters

the cluster richness. We have compared our N-body results with simple
analytical theories of cluster formation, like the peak theories or the local

the counts and redshift distributions well but produces too blue a population.
We show that surface brightness selection has a significant effect on the

not, however, account for the steepness of the counts at fainter magnitudes.

two layers---representing a CuO$_2$ plane and a CuO chain---per unit cell.
There is a BCS--like pairing (both $s$ wave and $d$ wave are considered)
interaction localised in the CuO$_2$ planes. The CuO chains become
superconducting at temperatures lower than $T_c$ because of their proximity to
the planes, and there is an induced gap in the chains. Since the temperature
dependence of the penetration depth in the $b$ direction (along the chains) is
sensitive to the size of the induced gap, the difference between the shapes of
the penetration depth curves in the $a$ and $b$ directions reveals a great deal
about the nature of the condensate in the chains. We find that in our proximity
model there are always regions of the chain Fermi surface on which the induced
gap is much smaller than $T_c$, so that the temperature dependence of
$\lambda_b$ is always different than that of $\lambda_a$. Experimental
observations of the of the $ab$ anisotropy show nearly identical temperature
dependences. The main result of our paper, then, is that a simple proximity
model in which the pairing interaction is localized to the planes, and the
planes are coherently coupled to the chains cannot account for the superfluid

has recently shown that a unital AF algebra has the APFP if and only if it has

of C*-algebras with the APFP. We prove various properties of such algebras. For
example: They have connected invertible group, trivial K_1, and stable rank 1.
In the unital case, the K_0 group separates the tracial states. The APFP passes
to matrix algebras. and if I is an ideal in A such that I and A/I have the
APFP, then so does A. We also give some new examples of C*-algebras with the
APFP, including type II_1 factors and infinite-dimensional simple unital direct
limits with slow dimension growth, real rank zero, and trivial K_1 group. An
infinite- dimensional simple unital direct limit with slow dimension growth and
with the APFP must have real rank zero, but we also give examples of unital

gravity, notably at the second post-Newtonian (2PN) level, is introduced.
Contrary to previous frameworks which attempted at parametrizing any
conceivable deviation from general relativity, we focus on the best motivated
class of models, in which gravity is mediated by a tensor field together with
one or several scalar fields. The 2PN approximation of these
""tensor-multi-scalar"" theories is obtained thanks to a diagrammatic expansion
which allows us to compute the Lagrangian describing the motion of N bodies. In
contrast with previous studies which had to introduce many phenomenological
parameters, we find that the 2PN deviations from general relativity can be
fully described by only two new 2PN parameters, epsilon and zeta, beyond the
usual (Eddington) 1PN parameters beta and gamma. It follows from the basic
tenets of field theory, notably the absence of negative-energy excitations,
that (beta-1), epsilon and zeta (as well as any new parameter entering higher
post-Newtonian orders) must tend to zero with (gamma-1). It is also found that
epsilon and zeta do not enter the 2PN equations of motion of light. Therefore,
light-deflection or time-delay experiments cannot probe any theoretically
motivated 2PN deviation from general relativity, but they can give a clean
access to (gamma-1), which is of greatest significance as it measures the basic
coupling strength of matter to the scalar fields. Because of the importance of
self-gravity effects in neutron stars, binary-pulsar experiments are found to
constitute a unique testing ground for the 2PN structure of gravity. A
simplified analysis of four binary pulsars already leads to significant
constraints: |epsilon| < 7x10^-2, |zeta| < 6x10^-3.

$A(M_{4})$ for the four and high dimensional quantum gravity. From these

to the product of Feynman path integrals evaluated on time slices with
curvature and length action for the gonihedric string and with Euler character
and gonihedric action for the Regge gravity. In both cases the interaction is
proportional to the overlapping sizes of the paths or surfaces on the
neighboring time slices. On the lattice we constructed spin system with local
interaction, which have the same partition function as the quantum gravity. The

  Maynooth (Ireland), May 1995. (LaTeX file)",,,,"hep-th gr-qc",,"  Relevant physical models are described by singular Lagrangians, so that their
Hamiltonian description is based on the Dirac theory of constraints. The
qualitative aspects of this theory are now understood, in particular the role
of the Shanmugadhasan canonical transformation in the determination of a
canonical basis of Dirac's observables allowing the elimination of gauge
degrees of freedom from the classical description of physical systems. This
programme was initiated by Dirac for the electromagnetic field with charged
fermions. Now Dirac's observables for Yang-Mills theory with fermions (whose
typical application is QCD) have been found in suitable function spaces where
the Gribov ambiguity is absent. Also the ones for the Abelian Higgs model are
known and those for the $SU(2) \times U(1)$ electroweak theory with fermions
are going to be found with the same method working for the Abelian case. The
main task along these lines will now be the search of Dirac's observables for
tetrad gravity in the case of asymptotically flat 3-manifolds. The philosophy
behind this approach is ``first reduce, then quantize"": this requires a global
symplectic separation of the physical variables from the gauge ones so that the
role of differential geometry applied to smooth field configurations is
dominating, in contrast with the standard approach of ``first quantizing, then
reducing"", where, in the case of gauge field theory, the reduction process
takes place on distributional field configurations, which dominate in quantum
measures. This global separation has been accomplished till now, at least at a
heuristic level, and one is going to have a classical (pseudoclassical for the
fermion) variables basis for the physical description of the $SU(3)\times
SU(2)\times U(1)$ standard model; instead, with tetrad gravity one expects to

mixing are described. First, an explicit choice of interpolating fields for the
vector mesons is displayed for which both the mixing in the propagator and the
isospin-breaking at the nucleon-vector meson vertices (and hence also the
one-vector-meson-exchange contribution to NN charge symmetry breaking) vanish
identically at $q^2=0$. Second, it is shown, using the constraints of unitarity
and analyticity on the spectral function of the vector meson propagator, that
there is no possible choice of interpolating fields for the $\rho^0$,
$\omega^0$ mesons such that, with the $\rho\omega$ element of the propagator
defined by $\Delta^{\rho\omega}_{\mu\nu}(q^2)= (g_{\mu\nu}-q_\mu q_\nu
/q^2)$$\theta (q^2)/(q^2-m^2_\rho )(q^2- m^2_\omega )$, $\theta (q^2)$ is
independent of momentum. It follows that the standard treatment of charge
symmetry breaking in few-body systems cannot be interpreted as arising from any
realizable effective meson-baryon Lagrangian and must, therefore, be considered
purely phenomenological in content.

that measurement will be performed. So, the derivation of the freedom of the
