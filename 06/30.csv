with luminosity and redshift have been investigated by means of statistical
estimators that are ``robust'' and allow at the same time to eliminate the
influence of the measurement errors. The analysis in the QSOs rest frame of
both the ensemble structure function ($SF$) and individual variability indices
show: 1) a negative correlation between variability and luminosity; 2) a
significant positive correlation between variability and $z$; 3) such
correlations may be equally well parameterized either with a model in which the
timescale of the variability is fixed for all the QSOs ($\tau \sim 2.4$ yr),
while the amplitude linearly increases with the absolute magnitude and $z$, or
with a model in which the timescale of the variability linearly depends on the
absolute magnitude and the amplitude is only a function of $z$. The same
analysis carried out in the observer's frame shows: 1) a negative correlation
between variability and luminosity; 2) the timescale of variability does not
depend significantly either on the absolute magnitude or on $z$; 3) the
ensemble structure function is well represented by a parameterization in which,
with a fixed timescale of about 5.5 yr, the amplitude linearly increases with
the absolute magnitude; 4) although the general behaviour of the $SF$ does not
show a systematic variation of the timescale and/or amplitude with $z$, if we
examine the average variability index for objects with $-25>M_B>-27$, we find
that below $z=1$ QSOs are significantly less variable than at higher redshift.
Implications in terms of the black-hole, starburst and microlensing models are
briefly discussed.

the CF $\xi(r)$ and in particular the behavior of the ""{\it correlation

respect we find, unambiguously, that the luminosity segregation effect is not
supported by any experimental evidence. In addition we have studied the
galaxian number-density ($n(r)$) and number-counts ($N(m)$) in the VL
subsamples finding a good agreement with the properties of a fractal
distribution. In particular our conclusion is that the $n(r)$ relation allows
to extend the analysis of the fractal nature up to a deeper depth than that
reached by the CF analysis, and, we find evidence for fractal properties up to
the limiting depth of $120-140 h^{-1} Mpc$. We stress that the $N(m)$ relation
must be studied in VL subsamples rather than in magnitude limited ones as
usually done. Finally we have considered the correlations between galaxy
positions and luminosities by means of the multifractal analysis. We find clear
evidence for self-similar behavior of the whole luminosity-space distribution.
These results confirm and extend those of Coleman \& Pietronero (1992).

law, and the systems are isolated. While the collapse of the core exhibits the
expected segregation of different masses, we find that the post-collapse
evolution is, at a first approximation, homologous. This is quite surprising
because there is no reason for supposing that mass segregation should not
continue to have a substantial effect on the evolution of the cluster. In fact
the spatial distribution of the mean stellar mass is nearly static throughout
the post-collapse regime, except for the overall expansion of the systems, and
this helps to explain why the post-collapse evolution is nearly self-similar.
Self-similarity is also exhibited by the distribution of anisotropy and the
profile of departures from equipartition, which show little change during the
post-collapse phase. The departures from energy equipartition and isotropy are
small in the core and increase with radius. During post-collapse evolution
massive stars (mainly) are removed from the system by binary activity. This
effect dominates the preferential escape of low-mass stars due to standard
two-body relaxation processes.

indication for non-perturbative corrections of order $\lqcd/(Q(1-z))$. We find
that, once soft gluon emission is accurately taken into account, the leading
renormalon divergence in the resummed cross section is cancelled by
higher-order perturbative contributions in the exponent of the resummed cross
section. From this evidence, `higher twist' corrections to the hard cross
section in Drell-Yan production should therefore intervene only at order
$\lqcd^2/((Q^2 (1-z)^2)$ in the entire perturbative domain $Q (1-z) > \lqcd$.
We compare this result with hadronic event shape variables, comment on the
potential universality of non-perturbative corrections to resummed cross
sections, and on possible implications for phenomenology.

also, through their Q^2 dependence, give information on its gluonic content.
Using DGLAP evolution, we find that the gluon distribution in the Pomeron is
very hard and the gluons carry more momentum than the quarks. This indicates
that the Pomeron, unlike ordinary hadrons, is a mostly gluonic object. With our
definition of the Pomeron flux factor the total momentum carried by quarks and
gluons turns out to be 0.3-0.4 - strongly violating the momentum sum rule.

realistic models in which mixing between the $\gamma_B$ and the electroweak

with precision electroweak measurements. Such mixing may nevertheless provide a

lepton decay are rather stable with respect to change of the scheme, provided
that an improved formula is used, which involves numerical evaluation of the
contour integral in the complex energy plane with the Adler function under the

shown that also in the case of the of QCD corrections to $e^{+}e^{-}$
annihilation into hadrons the conventional expansion has sizable scheme

obtained when the QCD corrections are expressed as a contour integral, with the
Adler function under the integral, resumming in this way the large $\pi^{2}$

of these black holes, the members of which are shown to be supersymmetric. We
find that the entropy of such an extremal black hole, when calculated at the
stringy stretched horizon, scales in such a way that it can be identified with
the entropy of the elementary string state with the corresponding quantum

  This is the final form accepted by the J. of Pure and Applied Algebra",,,,"q-alg hep-th math.QA",,"  We define the concept of higher order differential operators on a general
noncommutative, nonassociative superalgebra A, and show that a vertex operator
superalgebra has plenty of them, namely modes of vertex operators. A linear
operator \Delta is a differential operator of order at most r if an inductively
defined (r+1)-form \Phi_{\Delta}^{r+1} is identically zero. When A is
supercommutative and associative and \Delta is an odd, square zero, second
order differential operator on A, \Phi_{\Delta}^2 defines a ""Batalin-Vilkovisky
algebra"" structure on A. We generalize this notion to any superalgebra with an
odd, square zero, second order differential operator, and show that all
properties of the classical BV bracket but one continue to hold ""on the nose"".
We also point out connections to Leibniz algebras and the noncommutative
homology theory of Loday. Taking the generalization process one step further,
we remove all conditions on \Delta to examine the changes in the basic
properties of the bracket. We see that a topological chiral algebra with a mild
restriction yields a classical BV algebra in the cohomology. Finally, we
investigate the quantum BV master equation and relate it to deformations of
differential graded algebras.
