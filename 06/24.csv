appliances. We show how knowledge about a device, together with knowledge about
the environment, can be used for reasoning about instructions. The information
communicated by the instructions can be planned from a version of the knowledge
of the artifact and environment. We present the latter, which we call the {\it
planning knowledge}, in the form of axioms in the {\it situation calculus}.
This planning knowledge formally characterizes the behaviour of the artifact,
and it is used to produce a basic plan of actions that the device and user take
to accomplish a given goal. We explain how both procedural and warning
instructions can be generated from this basic plan.
  In order to partially justify that instruction generation can be automated
from a formal device design specification, we assume that the planning
knowledge is {\it derivable\/} from the device and world knowledge.

quantum level, however, and within the path integral approach, the restriction,
inherent to the use of the SPA, to regular paths clashes with the fact that no

shown to lead to a prefactor for the path integral that is strictly divergent

by taking the ratio of $H\to WW^*$ decays to $H\to ZZ^*$ decays. This ratio
also has the advantage of being fairly insensitive to physics beyond the
Standard Model. Unfortunately, for Higgs masses of interest the $H\to ZZ^*$

of the elementary particles and their interactions. One of its most important
features is its large symmetry group, which contains the conformal
transformations in two dimensions as a subgroup. At quantum level, the symmetry
group of a theory gives rise to differential equations between correlation
functions of observables. We show that these Ward-identities are equivalent to
Operator Product Expansions (OPEs), which encode the short-distance
singularities of correlation functions with symmetry generators. The OPEs allow
us to determine algebraically many properties of the theory under study. We
analyse the calculational rules for OPEs, give an algorithm to compute OPEs,
and discuss an implementation in Mathematica. There exist different string
theories, based on extensions of the conformal algebra to so-called W-algebras.
These algebras are generically nonlinear. We study their OPEs, with as main
results an efficient algorithm to compute the beta-coefficients in the OPEs,
the first explicit construction of the WB_2-algebra, and criteria for the
factorisation of free fields in a W-algebra. An important technique to
construct realisations of W-algebras is Drinfel'd- Sokolov reduction. The
method consists of imposing certain constraints on the elements of an affine
Lie algebra. We quantise this reduction via gauged WZNW-models. This enables us
in a theory with a gauged W-symmetry, to compute exactly the correlation
functions of the effective theory. Finally, we investigate the critical
W-string theories based on an extension of the conformal algebra with one
symmetry generator of dimension N. We clarify how the spectrum of this theory
forms a minimal model of the W_N-algebra.
