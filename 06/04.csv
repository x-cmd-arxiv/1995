Lie group $K$ in a Hamiltonian fashion, with moment map $\mu: M \to \Lie(K)^*$
and Marsden-Weinstein reduction $M_{red} = \mu^{-1}(0)/K$. In this paper, we
assume that $M$ has a $K$-invariant K\""ahler structure. In an earlier paper, we
proved a formula (the residue formula) for $\eta_0 e^{\omega_0}[M_{red}]$ for
any $\eta_0 \in H^*(M_{red})$, where $\omega_0$ is the induced symplectic form
on $M_{red}$. Here we apply the residue formula in the special case $\eta_0 =
Td(M_{red})$; when $K$ acts freely on $\mu^{-1}(0)$ this yields a formula for
the Riemann-Roch number $RR (L_{red})$ of a holomorphic line bundle $L_{red}$
on $M_{red}$ that descends from a holomorphic line bundle $L$ on $M$ for which
$c_1(L) = \omega$. Using the holomorphic Lefschetz formula we similarly obtain
a formula for the $K$-invariant Riemann-Roch number $RR^K(L) $ of $L$. In the
case when the maximal torus $T$ of $K$ has dimension one (except in a few
special circumstances), we show the two formulas are the same. Thus in this
special case the residue formula is equivalent to the result of Guillemin and
Sternberg that $RR(L_{red}) = RR^K(L)$. (The residue formula was proved under
the assumption that 0 is a regular value of $\mu$, and was given in terms of

other emission-line features lie $\sim3-4\arcsec$ on either side of the

where the surface magnetic field, $B_\S$, of the neutron star is strong. For
$B\ga4\times10^8\rm\,T$, the curvature $\gamma$-quanta emitted tangentially to
the curved force lines of the magnetic field are captured near the threshold of
bound pair creation and are channelled along the magnetic field as bound
electron-positron pairs (positronium). The stability of such bound pairs
against ionization by the parallel electric field, $E_\parallel$, in the polar
cap, and against photoionization is discussed. Unlike free pairs, bound pairs
do not screen $E_\parallel$ near the neutron star. As a consequence, the energy
flux in highly relativistic particles and high-frequency (X-ray and/or
$\gamma$-ray) radiation from the polar gaps can be much greater than in the
absence of positronium formation. We discuss this enhancement for (a)
Arons-type models, in which particles flow freely from the surface, and find
any enhancement to be modest, and (b) Ruderman-Sutherland-type models, in which
particles are tightly bound to the surface, and find that the enhancement can
be substantial. In the latter case we argue for a self-consistent,
time-independent model in which partial screening of $E_\parallel$ maintains it
close to the threshold value for field ionization of the bound pairs, and in
which a reverse flux of accelerated particles maintains the polar cap at a
temperature such that thermionic emission supplies the particles needed for
this screening. This model applies only in a restricted range of periods,
$P_2<P<P_1$, and it implies an energy flux in high-energy particles that can
correspond to a substantial fraction of the spin-down power of the pulsar.

  ftp://ramanujan.chem.nyu.edu/pub/nano1.ps",,,,"chem-ph cond-mat physics.chem-ph",,"  The ground state structures of small silicon clusters are determined through
exhaustive tight-binding molecular dynamics simulation studies. These
simulations revealed that \Si{11} is an icosahedron with one missing cap,
\Si{12} is a complete icosahedron, \Si{13} is a surface capped icosahedron,
\Si{14} is a 4-4-4 layer structure with two caps, \Si{15} is a 1-5-3-5-1 layer
structure, and \Si{16} is a partially closed cage consisting of five-membered
rings. The characteristic feature of these clusters is that they are all
surface.
  Smalley and co-workers discovered that chemisorption reactivities of silicon
clusters vary over three orders of magnitude as a function of cluster size. In
particular, they found that \Si{33}, \Si{39}, and \Si{45} clusters are least
reactive towards various reagents compared to their immediate neighbors in
size. We provide insights into this observed reactivity pattern through our
stuffed fullerene model. This structural model consists of bulk-like core of
five atoms surrounded by fullerene-like surface. Reconstruction of the ideal
fullerene geometry gives rise to four-fold coordinated crown atoms and
$\pi$-bonded dimer pairs. This model yields unique structures for \Si{33},
\Si{39}, and \Si{45} clusters without any dangling bonds and thus explains
their lowest reactivity towards chemisorption of closed shell reagents. We also
explain why a) these clusters are substantially unreactive compared to bulk
surfaces and b) dissociative chemisorption occurs on bulk surfaces while
molecular chemisorption occurs on cluster surfaces. Finally, experiments on
Si$_x$X$_y$ (X = B, Al, Ga, P, As, AlP, GaAs) are suggested as a means of
verifying the proposed model.
