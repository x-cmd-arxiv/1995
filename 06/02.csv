that the photon number count information is necessary to distinguish a genuine
Compton-Getting effect from some other anisotropy and to fully test the proper

determined from the CMB, we find the surprising result that although the number
weighted distribution is consistent with isotropy, the fluence weighted dipole
has a correlation with the CMB dipole that has a probability of occuring only
10% of the time for an isotropic photon distribution. Furthermore, the photon

2-sigma level. This could be an indication that a non-negligible fraction of

naturally explained if most (or all) of the cosmic rays presently observed

the injection rate of these particles was enormously higher in the past, as
would be the case if the injection resulted from the decay of an ultra-massive
particle with lifetime of order 10^{9} yr. Even with such a rapid source
evolution, the observed cosmic ray spectrum below about 10^{18.5} eV cannot be
explained in this manner. However, we show that a 1/E^3 injection spectrum can
account for the observed spectrum below 10^{18.5} eV}, with the steepening
observed by the Fly's Eye group between 10^{17.6} eV and 10^{18.5} eV being
very naturally explained by e+ - e- production effects. This latter fact lends
support to the hypothesis that the cosmic rays in this energy regime are

the gravitational and supernova energy injected during formation. A crucial
aspect of this process is whether the gas cools as fast as it falls into the
gravitational potential well. If it does then rapid normal star formation is
assumed to ensue. If not, and the gas can still cool by the present time, then
the situation resembles that of a cooling flow, such as commonly found in
clusters of galaxies. The cooled matter is assumed to accumulate as very cold
clouds and/or low mass stars, i.e. as baryonic dark matter. In this paper we
investigate the likelihood of a cooling flow phase during the hierarchical
formation of galaxies. We concentrate on the behaviour of the gas, using a
highly simplified treatment of the evolution of the dark matter potential
within which the gas evolves. We assume that normal star formation is limited
by how much gas the associated supernovae can unbind and allow the gas profile
to flatten as a consequence of supernova energy injection. We find that cooling
flows are an important phase in the formation of most galaxies with total (dark
plus luminous) masses approxgt 10^12 Msun , creating about 20 per cent of the
total dark halo in a galaxy such as our own and a smaller but comparable
fraction of an elliptical galaxy of similar mass. The onset of a cooling flow
determines the upper mass limit for the formation of a visible spheroid from
gas, setting a characteristic mass scale for normal galaxies. We argue that
disk formation requires a cooling flow phase and that dissipation in the
cooling flow phase is the most important factor in the survival of normal
galaxies during subsequent hierarchical mergers.

been implemented by imposing suitable renormalisation conditions on quark

from several independent numerical simulations at $\beta=6.0$ and $6.2$, and
using, for the meson correlators, the results obtained by the APE group at the

different values of $\beta$, is $\labar =190 \err{50}{30}$ MeV. For the

contributions. This map relates electric-magnetic duality to modular invariance
of the toroidal model and, conversely, the $O(d,d',\Z)$ duality to the
invariance of Maxwell theory under the 4d mapping class group. These dualities
and the relation between toroidal models and Maxwell theory can be understood
by regarding both theories as dimensional reductions of a self-dual 2-form
theory in six dimensions. Generalizations to more $U(1)$-gauge fields and
reductions from higher dimensions are also discussed. We find indications that
the Abelian gauge theories related to 4d string theories with $N=4$ space-time
supersymmetry are exactly duality invariant.

both defined by the vanishing of real polynomials, then any sufficiently smooth
CR mapping with Jacobian not identically zero extends holomorphically provided
the hypersurfaces are holomorphically nondegenerate . Conversely, we prove that
holomorphic nondegeneracy is necessary for this property of CR mappings to
hold. For the case of unequal dimensions, we also prove that if $M$ is an
algebraic hypersurface in $ C^N$ which does not contain any complex variety of
positive codimension and $M'$ is the sphere in $ C^{N+1 }$ , then extendability
holds for all CR mappings with certain minimal a priori regularity.
  Theorem A. Let $M$ and $M'$ be two algebraic hypersurfaces in $C^N$ and
assume that $M$ is connected and holomorphically nondegenerate. If $H$ is a
smooth CR mapping from $M$ to $M'$ with $ Jac H \not\equiv 0$, where $Jac H$ is
the Jacobian determinant of $H$, then $H$ extends holomorphically in an open
neighborhood of $M$ in $ C^N$.
  A recent example given by Ebenfelt shows that the conclusion of Theorem A
need not hold if $M$ is real analytic, but not algebraic.
  Theorem B. Let $M$ be a connected real analytic hypersurface in $C^N$ which
is holomorphically degenerate at some point $p_1$. Let $p_0 \in M$ and suppose
there exists a germ at $p_0$ of a smooth CR function on $M$ which does not
extend holomorphically to any full neighborhood of $p_0$ in $C^N$. Then there
exists a germ at $p_0$ of a smooth CR diffeomorphism from $M$ into itself,
fixing $p_0$, which does not extend holomorphically to any neighborhood of
$p_0$ in $C^N$.
  Theorem C. Let $M\subset C^N$ be an algebraic hypersurface. Assume that there
is no nontrivial complex analytic variety contained in $M$ through $p_0 \in M$,
and let $m=m_{p_0}$ be the D'Angelo type. If $H: M \to S^{2N+1}\subset C^{N+1}$
is a CR map of class $C^m$, where $S^{2N+1}$ denotes the boundary of the unit
ball in $C^{N+1 }$, then $H$ admits a holomorphic extension in a neighborhood
of $p_0$.

demonstrated. We examine the Lorentz invariance of the NN$\rightleftharpoons$NN

impulse approximation calculations without boost operators to be essentially
exact. Conversely, a similar analysis of the $\Delta{\rm

applications. The need for additional data is stressed.
