state tables (Rogers 1994). Stellar models and isochrones were constructed for
low metallicity systems ($-2.8 \le [Fe/H] \le -0.6$). Above $M\sim 0.7\,\msun$,
the isochrones are very similar to those which are constructed using an
equation of state which includes the analytical Debye-Huckel correction at high
temperatures. The absolute magnitude of the main sequence turn-off (\mvto) with
the OPAL or Debye-Huckel isochrones is about 0.06 magnitudes fainter, at a
given age, than \mvto derived from isochrones which do not include the
Debye-Huckel correction. As a consequence, globular clusters ages derived using
\mvto are reduced by 6 -- 7\% as compared to the ages determined from the
standard isochrones. Below $M\sim 0.7\,\msun$, the OPAL isochrones are
systematically hotter (by approximately 0.04 in B-V) at a given magnitude as
compared to the standard, or Debye-Huckel isochrones. However, the lower mass
models fall out of the OPAL table range, and this could be the cause of the
differences in the location of the lower main-sequences.

bar, previously inferred from optical and 21 cm observations, and an
ovally-shaped ring-like structure in the plane of the disk. The K isophotes
become progressively elongated and skewed to the position angle of the bar
(outside and inside the `ring') forming an inner bar-like region. The galaxy
exhibits a circumnuclear starburst in the inner part of the K `ring'. Two
maxima of the K emission have been observed to lie symmetrically with respect
to the nucleus and equidistant from it slightly leading the stellar bar. We
interpret the twists in the K isophotes as being indicative of the presence of
a double inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) and test this hypothesis by modeling
the gas flow in a self-consistent gas + stars disk embedded in a halo, with an
overall NGC4321-like mass distribution. We have reproduced the basic morphology
of the region (the bar, the large scale trailing shocks, two symmetric K peaks
corresponding to gas compression maxima which lie at the caustic formed by the
interaction of a pair of trailing and leading shocks in the vicinity of the
inner ILR, both peaks being sites of SF, and two additional zones of SF
corresponding to the gas compression maxima, referred usually as `twin peaks').

numerical results for electronic models, it is becoming apparent that a hopping
along the plaquette diagonals has to be included to obtain a quantitative
agreement. According to recent estimations the value of the diagonal hopping
$t'$ appears to be material dependent. However, the values for $t'$ discussed
in the literature were obtained comparing theoretical results in the weak
coupling limit with experimental photoemission data and band structure
calculations. The goal of this paper is to study how $t'$ gets renormalized as
the interaction between electrons, $U$, increases. For this purpose, the effect
of adding a bare diagonal hopping $t'$ to the fully interacting two dimensional
Hubbard model Hamiltonian is investigated using numerical techniques. Positive
and negative values of $t'$ are analyzed. Spin-spin correlations, $n(\bf{k})$,
$\langle n\rangle$ vs $\mu$, and local magnetic moments are studied for values
of $U/t$ ranging from 0 to 6, and as a function of the electronic density. The
influence of the diagonal hopping in the spectral function $A(\bf{k},\omega)$
is also discussed, and the changes in the gap present in the density of states
at half-filling are studied. We introduce a new criterion to determine probable
locations of Fermi surfaces at zero temperature from $n(\bf{k})$ data obtained
at finite temperature. It appears that hole pockets at ${\bf{k}}=(\pi/2,\pi/2)$
may be induced for negative $t'$ while a positive $t'$ produces similar
features at ${\bf{k}}=(\pi,0)$ and $(0,\pi)$. Comparisons with the standard 2D
Hubbard ($t'=0$) model indicate that a negative $t'$ hopping amplitude appears
to be dynamically generated. In general, we conclude that it is very dangerous
to extract a bare parameter of the Hamiltonian $(t')$ from PES data where

truncation of free field theory at the Planck scale. His analysis was performed
numerically and based on a hydrodynamical model. In this work, by analytical
methods, the mathematical and physical origin of Unruh's result is revealed. An
alternative truncation scheme which may be more appropriate for black hole
physics is proposed and analyzed. In both schemes the thermal Hawking radiation
remains unaffected even though transplanckian energies no longer appear. The
universality of this result is explained by working in momentum space. In that
representation, in the presence of a horizon, the d'Alembertian equation
becomes a singular first order equation. In addition, the boundary conditions
corresponding to vacuum before the black hole formed are that the in--modes
contain positive momenta only. Both properties remain valid when the spectrum
is truncated and they suffice to obtain Hawking radiation.

by calculating the distributions of instanton and monopole densities around
static color sources. We find a suppression of the densities close to external
sources and the formation of a flux tube between a static quark--antiquark
pair. The similarity in the behavior of instantons and monopoles around static
sources might be due to a local correlation between these topological objects.
On an $8^{3} \times 4$ lattice at $\beta=5.6$, it turns out that topological
quantities are correlated approximately two lattice spacings.

investigate analytical properties of the Schr\""odinger equation solution in
time variable. It is shown, that this expansion, which is in general
asymptotic, converges for a number of potentials (widely used, in particular,
in one-dimensional many-body problems), and besides, the convergence takes
place only for definite discrete values of the coupling constant. For other
values of charge the divergent expansion determines the functions having
essential singularity at origin (beyond usual $\delta$-function). This does not
permit one to fulfil the initial condition. So, the function obtained from the
Schr\""odinger equation cannot be the evolution operator kernel. The latter,
rigorously speaking, does not exist in this case. Thus, the kernel exists only
for definite potentials, and moreover, at the considered examples the charge
may have only quantized values.

Brownian motion models, consisting of a particle moving in a potential $V(x)$
in interaction with a heat bath at temperature $T$ and dissipation gamma, in
the Markovian regime. The evolution of the density operator for this open
system is thus described by a non-unitary master equation. The phase space
histories of the system are described by a class of quasiprojectors.
Generalizing earlier results of Hagedorn and Omn\`es, we show that a phase
space projector onto a phase space cell $\Gamma$ is approximately evolved under
the master equation into another phase space projector onto the classical
dissipative evolution of $\Gamma$, and with a certain amount of degradation due
to the noise produced by the environment. We thus show that histories of phase
space samplings approximately decohere, and that the probabilities for these
histories are peaked about classical dissipative evolution, with a width of
peaking depending on the size of the noise.
