  Accepted for publication in MNRAS pink pages; submitted 1 May 1995",,"10.1093/mnras/276.1.L31",,"astro-ph",,"  The extreme bolometric luminosity of IRAS F10214+4724, and in particular the
huge mass in molecular gas inferred from the CO line fluxes have led to
suggestions that this is a giant galaxy in the process of formation. An
arc-like structure and the closeness of a second object suggest, however, that
gravitational lensing may be responsible for its anomalously high luminosity
and mass. In this paper, we use an optical spectrum taken in conditions of
0.7-arcsec seeing to provide further evidence that F10214+4724 is a
gravitationally lensed system. We measure tentative redshifts of 0.896 and
0.899 for galaxies projected $\approx 1$ and $\approx 3$ arcsec from IRAS
F10214+4724 respectively. Identifying the former as the lensing galaxy we
obtain a mass:light ratio consistent with those derived for other lenses, and
find that its luminosity is consistent with the velocity dispersion deduced
from the radius of the Einstein ring. If lensed, our models suggest
magnification by a factor $\sim 10$, and hence an intrinsic bolometric
luminosity for F10214+4724 similar to local ULIRGs.

effective 3-dimensional theory, for a Higgs mass of about $35 GeV$. In the
broken symmetry phase our results on masses and the Higgs condensate are
consistent with 2-loop perturbative results. However, we find a
non-perturbative lowering of the transition temperature, similar to the one
previously found at $m_H = 80 GeV$. For the symmetric phase, bound state masses
and the static force are determined and compared with results for pure $SU(2)$
theory.

cuttoffs for the fermions and gauge bosons. We use a lattice with spacing $b$
to regulate the gauge fields in standard fashion, while computing the chiral
fermion determinant on a finer lattice with spacing $f << b$. This determinant
is computed in the background of $f$-lattice gauge fields, obtained by
gauge-covariantly interpolating $b$-lattice gauge fields. The notorious
doublers that plague lattice theories containing fermions are decoupled by the
addition of a Wilson term. In chiral theories such a term breaks gauge
invariance explicitly. However, the advantage of the two-cutoff regulator is
that gauge invariance can be restored to $O(f^2/b^2)$ by a {\it one-loop}
subtraction of calculable local gauge field counterterms. We show that the only
obstruction to this procedure is the presence of an uncancelled gauge anomaly
among the fermion representations. We conclude that for practical purposes, it
suffices to choose $f/b \sim b/L$, where $L^4$ is the physical volume of the
system. In our construction it is simple to prove the Adler-Bardeen theorem for
anomalies in global currents to all orders. The related subject of fermion
number violation is also studied. Finally, we discuss the prospects for
improving the efficiency of our algorithm.

discussed. It is assumed that the low--energy degrees of freedom are just
fermions and gauge bosons and that the Higgs bosons are generated dynamically
through a set of gauge-- and parity--invariant 4-fermion operators. It is shown
that in a model with composite bi-doublet and two triplet scalars there is no
parity breaking at low energies, whereas in the model with two doublets instead
of two triplets parity is broken automatically regardless of the choice of the
parameters of the model. For phenomenologically allowed values of the
right--handed scale the tumbling symmetry breaking mechanism is realized in
which parity breaking at a high scale $\mu_R$ propagates down and eventually
causes the \EW symmetry breaking at the scale $\mu_{EW}\sim 100$ GeV. The model
exhibits a number of low and intermediate mass Higgs bosons with certain
relations between their masses. In particular, the $SU(2)_L$ Higgs doublet
$\chi_L$ is a pseudo--Goldstone boson of the accidental (approximate) $SU(4)$
symmetry of the Higgs potential and therefore is expected to be relatively
light.

problem to the relativistic velocity. There is a regime in which the final

measure in a sense the distance between the ground model reals and the reals in
the extension. We look at the ways the ``new'' reals can be aproximated by
``old'' reals. We consider localizations for infinite subsets of omega. Though
each member of [omega]^omega can be identified with its increasing enumeration,
the (standard) localizations of the enumeration does not provide satisfactory
information on successive points of the set. They give us ``candidates'' for
the n-th point of the set but the same candidates can appear several times for
distinct n. That led to a suggestion that we should consider disjoint subsets
of omega as sets of ``candidates'' for successive points of the localized set.
We have two possibilities. Either we can demand that each set from the
localization contains a limited number of members of the localized set or we
can postulate that each intersection of that kind is large. Localizations of
this kind are studied in section 1. In the second section we investigate
localizations of infinite subsets of omega by sets of integers from the ground
model. These localizations might be thought as localizations by partitions of
omega into successive intervals.
