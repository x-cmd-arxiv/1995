orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random
pointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. Light from
the centers of many AGN is obscured by optically thick circumnuclear matter and
in radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit light that is
relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and
magnitude of radiation anisotropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes
of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise
to different classes through different orientations.
  This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which include radio
galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and properties
of AGN and summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission. We outline the two
most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking quasars and
luminous radio galaxies and another linking BL~Lac objects and less luminous
radio galaxies. Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by
relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in
accordance with available data. We analyze the possible connections between
low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN. We review potential difficulties with
unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We
discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic
physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more
comprehensive data for larger complete samples become available. We conclude
with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this
field.

of COBE is well matched to the large positional uncertainties in the GRB
locations, although it also means that fluxes from (point source) GRB objects
will be diluted. In view of this we are doing a statistical search of the GRBs
which occurred during the currently released COBE DMR data (years 1990 and
1991), which overlap $\sim 200$ GRBs recorded by GRO. Here we concentrate on
just the top 10 GRBs (in peak counts/second). We obtain the limits on the
emission by comparing the COBE fluxes before and after the GRB at the GRB
location. Since it is thought that the microwave emission should lag the GRB
event, we have searched the GRB position for emission in the few months
following the GRB occurrence.

used to calculate the waveform, energy loss, and angular momentum loss from the
inspiralling binary. Using equations of motion which include terms due to
spin-orbit and spin-spin coupling, we evolve the orbit of a coalescing binary

spins of the bodies affect the waveform in several ways: 1) The spin terms
contribute to the orbital decay of the binary, and thus to the accumulated
phase of the gravitational waveform. 2) The spins cause the orbital plane to
precess, which changes the orientation of the orbital plane with respect to an
observer, thus causing the shape of the waveform to be modulated. 3) The spins
contribute directly to the amplitude of the waveform. We discuss the size and
importance of spin effects for the case of two coalescing neutron stars, and
for the case of a neutron star orbiting a rapidly rotating $10M_\odot$ black
hole.

late decay of a population of supersymmetric particles is considered. If the
decay takes place below the LSP freeze out temperature, a nonthermal
distribution of LSPs results. With conserved $R$ parity these relic LSPs
contribute to the dark matter density. A net asymmetry can exist in the
population of decaying particles if it arises from coherent production along a
supersymmetric flat direction. The asymmetry is transferred to baryons if the
condensate decays through the lowest order nonrenormalizable operators which
couple to $R$ odd combinations of standard model particles. This also ensures
at least one LSP per decay. The relic baryon and LSP number densities are then
roughly equal. The ratio of baryon to dark matter densities is then naturally
$\Omegab / \OmegaLSP \sim {\cal O}(\mb / \mLSP)$. The resulting upper limit on
the LSP mass is model dependent but in the range ${\cal O}(30-140)$ GeV. The
total relic density is related to the order at which the flat direction which
gives rise to the condensate is lifted. The observed density is obtained for a
direction which is lifted by a fourth order Planck scale suppressed operator in
