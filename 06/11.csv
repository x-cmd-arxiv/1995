Sagittarius. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy is the nearest galaxy known, subtends
an angle of $> 10$ degrees on the sky, lies at a distance of $24 \kpc$ from the
Sun, $\sim 16 \kpc$ from the centre of the Milky Way. Itis comparable in size
and luminosity to the largest dwarf spheroidal, has a well populated red
horizontal branch with a blue HB extension; a substantial carbon star
population; and a strong intermediate age stellar component with evidence of a
metallicity spread. Isodensity maps show it to be markedly elongated along a
direction pointing towards the Galactic centre and suggest that it has been
tidally distorted. The close proximity to the Galactic centre, the
morphological appearance and the radial velocity of 140 km/s indicate that this
system must have undergone at most very few close orbital encounters with the
Milky Way. It is currently undergoing strong tidal disruption prior to being
integrated into the Galaxy. Probably all of the four globular clusters, M54,
Arp 2, Ter 7 and Ter 8, are associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and
will probably share the fate of their progenitor.

linguistics and computational linguistics literature. Since the publication of
Nunberg's (1990) monograph on the topic, however, punctuation has seen its
stock begin to rise: spurred in part by Nunberg's ground-breaking work, a
number of valuable inquiries have been subsequently undertaken, including Hovy
and Arens (1991), Dale (1991), Pascual (1993), Jones (1994), and Briscoe
(1994). Continuing this line of research, I investigate in this paper how
Nunberg's approach to presenting punctuation (and other formatting devices)
might be incorporated into NLG systems. Insofar as the present paper focuses on
the proper syntactic treatment of punctuation, it differs from these other
subsequent works in that it is the first to examine this issue from the
generation perspective.

current (PCAC) relation and corresponding current algebra results. The paper
includes investigations of a chiral Ward-Takahashi identity, the explicit
chiral symmetry breaking by a finite current quark mass, the modifica- tion of
the PCAC relation and its consequences. Two explicit relations between the
nucleon axial vector form factor $g_A(q^2)$, pseudo-scalar form factor $
g_P(q^2)$ and the pion-nucleon coupling constant $g_{\pi NN}(q^2)$ is obtained.
One of the relation is confirmed, within the experimental error, by observation
in the $0<-q^2 <0.2$ $\mbox{GeV}^2$ region. The other one, which relates
$g_A(q^2)$ and $f_\pi(q^2) g_{\pi NN}(q^2)$ is studied by using known empirical
facts and dispersion relation. Thoeretical uncertainties are evaluated. Certain
inconsistencies, which is in favor of the introduction of diquark condensation,
is discovered. We briefly discuss how diquark condensation could provide an
answer to the question of where about of the quark numbers in a nucleon and a
nucleus, which is raised in explaining puzzles observed in the violation of
Gottfried sum rule and EMC effects.
