is found for the tune of the normal modes, which allows the normal mode tunes
to be computed from the 6x6 one turn transfer matrix. This result is similar to
the quadratic equation found for the normal mode tunes for the motion of a

3201 out to ~18 arcmin. A total of 857 radial velocities with median precision
~1 km/s for 399 member giants have been used to trace the velocity dispersion
profile out to 32' (the approximate tidal radius from fits of single-mass,
isotropic King-Michie models to the cluster surface brightness profiles). The
median difference in radial velocity for stars on either side of an imaginary
axis moved through the cluster in 1 degree steps shows a significant maximum
amplitude of 1.22+/-0.25 km/s. We discuss possible explanations of this result,
including: (1) cluster rotation; (2) preferential stripping of stars on
prograde orbits near the limiting radius; (3) the projection of the cluster
space velocity onto the plane of the sky and (4) a slight drift in the velocity
zero point. It is difficult to identify the primary cause of the observed
velocity field structure unambiguously, and we suspect that all of the above
processes may play a role. The B,V surface brightness profiles and radial
velocities have been modeled with single- & multi-mass King-Michie models and
nonparametric techniques. The density and M/L profiles show good agreement over
1.5<R<10 pc, and both approaches suggest a steady rise in M/L with distance
from the cluster center. Due to the low cluster luminosity, we are unable to
place useful constraints on the anisotropy of the velocity dispersion profile,
though the global mass-to-light ratio is well-constrained by the models as ~2.0
+/-0.2 for the multi-mass and nonparametric models, compared to ~ 1.65 +/-0.15
for models having equal-mass stars. Our best-fit, multi-mass models have mass
function slopes of x~0.75 +/-0.25, consistent with findings that mass function
depends on the position relative to the potential of the Galaxy.

We selected narrow-band filters in the $K$-band centered on strong emision
lines at the redshift of the targets. We reach limiting fluxes between
$1.6\times 10^{-17}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$ and $1.0\times

typical restframe line luminosities of $\sim 10^{42} - 10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$,
unobscured star formation rates of $\sim 1 - 100$ $M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$, and a
sampled comoving volume of several tens of Mpc$^3$. We have found no candidate
PGs at a $2\sigma$ confidence level. We demonstrate that for moderate dust
absorption ($A_V \gsim 2^m$) in a simple dust-screen model, our preliminary
survey puts a strong constraint on intrinsic PG luminosities during an intial
burst of star formation. In the case of the QSOs, we have used PSF-subtraction
to search for the presence of faint, extended line emission surrounding these
radio-quiet AGNs. We find no evidence for extended emission down to $3.7 \times
10^{-17}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$. This imposes limits on the reprocessed
fraction of the QSO continuum emission ranging between $0.02$\% and $0.29$\%;
if beaming effects are not important, then this implies similarly small
covering factors for clouds optically thick to the QSO continuum emission.

require accurate luminosities for a sample of remnants of varying ages, and in

in a narrow range of ages. In other respects, the M33 remnants are similar to

using training data corrupted by Gaussian noise. Each machine is considered in
the high temperature limit and in the replica symmetric approximation as well
as for one step of replica symmetry breaking. For the perceptron a phase
transition is found for low noise. However the transition is not to optimal
learning. If the noise is increased the transition disappears. In both cases
$\epsilon _{g}$ will approach optimal performance with a $(\ln\alpha

tested by comparing it with a similar term in $\tau^+$ decay. If T violation in
such a decay is milliweak or stronger, one can find it using the proposed
