  ftp://bessel.mps.ohio-state.edu/pub/ryden/figs.tar.Z",,"10.1086/176277",,"astro-ph",,"  Because the transformation from distance to redshift is nonlinear, maps in
redshift space become increasingly distorted as the redshift z becomes greater.
As noted by Alcock \& Paczy\'nski (1979), observed redshift distortions can be
used to estimate the deceleration parameter $q_0$. If $q_0$ is greater than -1,
voids in redshift space will be elongated along the line of sight. In addition,
distant voids will have a greater volume in redshift space than nearby voids.
Accurate measurement of the volume and the axis ratio of voids, as a function
of their central redshift, will provide an estimate of $q_0$. To test this
method of estimating $q_0$, I create a two-dimensional toy universe, free of
peculiar velocities, in which the galaxies are located near the walls of
Voronoi cells. The galaxies are then mapped into redshift space, adopting
different values of $q_0$. In redshift space, I estimate the area and the axis
ratio of the voids by fitting ellipses within the voids, using an algorithm
which maximizes the area of the empty ellipses and ensures that ellipses do not
overlap. The accuracy of the estimated values of $q_0$ is limited by the
intrinsic scatter in the size and shape of the voids. In the toy universe,
distinguishing between a $q_0 = -1$ universe and a $q_0 = 1/2$ universe
requires a survey which goes to a depth z > 0.1 in redshift space. Peculiar
velocities will create an additional source of uncertainty for the values of
$q_0$ measured in N-body simulations and in the real universe.

time-scale, which lies in the range between 0.5 and 3 days.
  In general, the results can be explained by the standard model, where shocks
are propagating down a relativistic jet. However, in the two most densely
sampled observations we found variability characteristics, which cannot easily
be explained by the standard model alone, demonstrating that at least in these
objects alternative models should be taken into account. Nevertheless, all

inferred from observations of type 1 Seyfert galaxies. Instead, the

  A number of effects such as anisotropic Compton scattering, the reflection
hump, feedback to the soft photon source by reprocessing, and an active region

their compactnesses and their elevations above the disk surface. Simplified

in the cluster to a radius of \sim 1.5 Mpc. We report the discovery of a bright
gravitationally-lensed arc at a redshift, z_{\rm arc} = 0.433, in the cluster.
This result identifies PKS0745 as the lowest-redshift cluster (z_{\rm clus} =

source are consistent with an S_{\rm ab} galaxy with ongoing star formation.
The projected cluster mass determined from lensing arguments is in excellent

This contrasts with previously-reported results for the clusters Abell 1689 and
Abell 2218, for which discrepancies of \sim a factor 2 in the lensing and X-ray
masses are observed. At both X-ray and optical wavelengths PKS0745 appears
regular and dynamically relaxed. Abell 1689 and Abell 2218 exhibit more complex
dynamical states, indicative of ongoing merger events. We suggest that merging
activity has lead to line-of-sight mass enhancements in these systems. The

  issue of Part I of ApJ",,"10.1086/176395","ARI-55","astro-ph",,"  We introduce a model Galactic field low-mass stellar population that has a
proportion of binary systems as observed, with a mass ratio distribution
consistent with observational constraints. The model single star and system
luminosity function agrees with the nearby and the Malmquist corrected
photometric luminosity function, respectively. We tabulate the model luminosity
functions in the photometric V-, I- and K-bands, and in bolometric magnitudes.
Unresolved binary systems are thus a natural explanation for the difference
between the nearby and photometric luminosity functions. A local overdensity of
faint stars needs not be postulated to account for the difference, and is very
unlikely. We stress that the nearby luminosity function can only be used to
weakly constrain the stellar mass function below $0.5\,M_\odot$, because of the
small sample size. The photometric luminosity function can only be used to put
lower limits on the stellar mass function because most binary systems are not
resolved. However, taken together the nearby and photometric stellar luminosity
function data do not imply a mass function with a peak at a mass of
$0.2-0.3\,M_\odot$. Instead, the data are consistent with a power-law mass
function between 0.08$\,M_\odot$ and $0.5\,M_\odot$. We urge researchers to
only use star count data that are properly corrected for {\it all}
contributions to cosmic scatter, photometric uncertainties, and unresolved
binaries, and to be aware of the severe limitations of theoretical
mass--luminosity relations for low mass stars, when drawing conclusions about
structure in the stellar mass function.

numerical estimates of the paper~[1] rely entirely on a formula which the
authors take from the inflationary literature. This formula, see Eqs.~(22),
(43), relates the amplitude of perturbations today with the amplitude of
perturbations during the inflationary stage. The formula suggests an enormous
increase of the amplitude, if the equation of state at the inflationary phase
has happened to be sufficiently close to the de Sitter one. The point of my
comment is that this formula is incorrect, as we will see below, and the

important role in nuclear physics. It is shown that the momentum-dependent
repulsive force of second order in the scalar field, which plays an important
role in Dirac phenomenology, can be found in the quark-meson coupling (QMC)
model, and that the properties of nuclear matter are well described through the
quark-scalar density in a nucleon and a self-consistency condition for the
scalar field. The difference between theories of point-like nucleons and
composite ones may be seen in the change of the $\omega$-meson mass in nuclear
matter if the composite nature of the nucleon suppresses contributions from
nucleon-antinucleon pair creation.

Gaudin models. Geometric Langlands correspondence relates D-modules on the
moduli space of G-bundles on a complex curve X and flat G^L-bundles on X.
Beilinson and Drinfeld construct it by applying a localization functor to
representations of affine algebras of critical level. We show that in genus
zero the corresponding D-modules are closely related to the diagonalization
problem in the Gaudin model associated to G. This allows us to give a new
interpretation of the Bethe ansatz and Sklyanin's separation of variables in
the Gaudin model in terms of Langlands correspondence.

The matrix elements of these operators can be expressed in terms of {\it
entire} functions in the position complex plane. These functions provide
solutions of the Ricatti equation associated with the time-independent
Schr\""odinger equation. We relate the normalizability of the eigenstates to the
global properties of the flows of this equation. These exact results yield
approximations which complement the WKB approximation and allow an arbitrarily
precise determination of the energy levels. We give numerical results for the

sensitive to reveal nonlocal correlations between distant parts of composite

the density operator of a local composite system must be convex mixture of the
subsystems' density operators. This result depends essentially on a plausible
consistency condition restricting the class of admissible local hidden variable
models.
