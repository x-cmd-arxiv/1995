cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) with $\Omega_{CDM}=0.4$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.6$; and $n=-1$ model with $\Omega=0.1$. We find that: (i)
Power law spectra lead to self-similar evolution in an $\Omega=1$ universe.
(ii) Stable clustering does not hold in an $\Omega=1$ universe to the extent
our simulations can ascertain. (iii) Stable clustering is a better
approximation in the case of $\Omega<1$ universe in which structure formation
freezes out at some low redshift. (iv) The relation between dimensionless pair
velocity and the mean correlation function, $\bar\xi$, is only approximately
independent of the shape of the power spectrum. At the nonlinear end, the
asymptotic value of the dimensionless pair velocity decreases with increasing
small scale power, because the stable clustering assumption is not universally
true. (v) The relation between the evolved $\bar\xi$ and the linear regime

function of redshift. The prevalence of mergers at intermediate redshifts is
fundamental to understanding how galaxies evolve and the relative population of
galaxy types. Mergers have been used to explain the excess of galaxies in faint
blue counts above the numbers expected from no-evolution models. Using deep
CFHT ($I\leq24$) imaging of a ``blank'' field we find a pair fraction which is
consistent with the galaxies in our sample being randomly distributed with no
significant excess of ``physical'' close pairs. This is contrary to the pair
fraction of $34\%\pm9\%$ found by Burkey {\it et al.} for similar magnitude
limits and using an identical approach to the pair analysis. Various reasons
for this discrepancy are discussed. Colors and morphologies of our close pairs
are consistent with the bulk of them being random superpositions although, as
indicators of interaction, these criteria are uncertain due to contamination of
field galaxies and difficulty in seeing structure at intermediate redshifts,
respectively. This observed lack of close pairs is probably linked with the
decreasing amplitude of the angular correlation function at faint limits. If
our faint samples are comprised of galaxies which have a higher average
redshift than brighter samples studied by other workers then either the merger
rate has been overestimated or there is a change in its behaviour from what is

$q$ of the (known) radius of the source star to the Einstein radius of the
MACHO, $q=\theta_s/\theta_e$. A classic method for doing this is to look for
the effect on the light curve of the finite size of the source. A modification
of this method proposed by Witt (1995) is to look for color changes in the
light curve due to the fact that the limb darkening of the source is different
in different bands. We demonstrate that the ``classical'' method is not
feasible unless the MACHO actually transits the source: if the MACHO passes at
say 1.5 source radii, there is still a sizable $\sim 5\%$ effect, but the light
curve cannot be distinguished from point-source light curves with different
parameters. However, color measurements in $V$ $(0.55\,\mu$m) and $H$

motion measurements at impact parameters of up to 2 source radii. Color maps in

shown that asymmetries and instabilities are a natural aspect of supernova
dynamics. In this paper, we highlight two phenomena: 1) the ``Brownian-like''
stochastic motion of the core in response to the convective ``boiling'' of the
mantle of the protoneutron star during the post-bounce, pre-explosion accretion
phase, and 2) the asymmetrical bounce and explosion of an aspherically

population of cool, compact objects these lenses represent could be the elusive
dark matter of our galactic halo. A year later in 1994, Sackett et al. reported
the discovery of a red halo in the galaxy NGC 5907 that seems to follow the
inferred radial distribution of its dark matter. This suggested that dwarf
stars could constitute its missing component. Since NGC 5907 is similar to the

central to the explosion itself and that a multitude of bent and broken fingers
is a common feature of the ejecta. In 2-D, the steady-state shock radius is
larger than its value in 1-D by 30\%--100\%. The critical condition for
explosion is thereby relaxed. Since supernovae are driven by neutrino heating,
they are coronal phenomena, akin to winds, though initially bounded by an
accretion tamp. Neutrino energy is pumped into the supernova during the shock's
propagation through the inner many thousands of kilometers and not
instantaneously. Curiously, just after the explosion is triggered, the matter
that will eventually be ejected is still bound. The high-speed fingers that
emerge from the core seem a natural explanation for the nickel bullets seen in
87A and the shrapnel inferred in some supernova remnants. Within 100 ms of the

suggest, however, that the pairing interaction in the CuO_2 planes may well be
d--wave but that the CuO chains destroy the tetragonal symmetry of the system.
We examine two ways in which this happens. In a simple model of an incoherent
junction, the chains distort the superconducting condensate away from
d_{x^2-y^2} symmetry. In a specular junction the chains destroy the tetragonal
symmetry of the tunneling matrix element. In either case, the loss of
tetragonal symmetry results in a finite Josephson current. Our calculated
values of the critical current for specular junctions are in good agreement
with the results of Sun and co-workers.

different ground state modes $\pi \pi$, $\pi \rho$, $\rho \rho$, and, assuming
the FSI phases to be negligible, we investigate the amount of uncertainty
coming from Penguins that can be parametrized by a dilution factor $D$ and an
angle shift $\Delta \alpha$. The parameter $D$ is either 1 or very close to 1
in all these modes, and it can be measured independently, up to a sign
ambiguity, by the $t$ dependence. Assuming factorization, we show that $\Delta
\alpha$ is much smaller for the modes $\rho \pi$ and $\rho \rho$ than for $\pi
\pi$, and we plot their allowed region as a function of $\alpha$ itself.
Moreover, we show that most of the modes contribute to the asymmetry with the
same sign, and define for their sum an effective $D_{eff}$ and an effective
$\Delta \alpha_{eff}$, an average of $\Delta \alpha$ for the different modes.
It turns out that $D_{eff}$ is of the order of 0.9, $\Delta \alpha_{eff}$ is
between 5 $\%$ and 10 $\%$ and, relative to $\pi \pi$, the statistical gain for
the sum is of about a factor 10. Finally, we compute the ratios $K\pi /\pi \pi

evolution of Rydberg wave packets for hydrogen. We show that after the initial
cycle of collapse and fractional/full revivals, which occurs on the time scale
$t_{\rm rev}$, a new sequence of revivals begins. We find that the structure of
the new revivals is different from that of the fractional revivals. The new
revivals are characterized by periodicities in the motion of the wave packet
with periods that are fractions of the revival time scale $t_{\rm rev}$. These
long-term periodicities result in the autocorrelation function at times greater
than $t_{\rm rev}$ having a self-similar resemblance to its structure for times
less than $t_{\rm rev}$. The new sequence of revivals culminates with the
formation of a single wave packet that more closely resembles the initial wave
packet than does the full revival at time $t_{\rm rev}$, i.e., a superrevival
forms. Explicit examples of the superrevival structure for both circular and
radial wave packets are given. We then study wave packets in alkali-metal
atoms, which are typically used in experiments. The behavior of these packets
is affected by the presence of quantum defects that modify the hydrogenic
revival time scales and periodicities. Their behavior can be treated
analytically using supersymmetry-based quantum-defect theory. We illustrate our
results for alkali-metal atoms with explicit examples of the revival structure
for radial wave packets in rubidium.

that it contains nothing probabilistic, except, in a certain frequency sense,
conscious perceptions. Sets of these perceptions can be deterministically
realized with measures given by expectation values of positive-operator-valued
awareness operators in a quantum state of the universe which never jumps or
collapses. Ratios of the measures for these sets of perceptions can be
interpreted as frequency-type probabilities for many actually existing sets
rather than as propensities for potentialities to be actualized, so there is
nothing indeterministic in SQM. These frequency-type probabilities generally
cannot be given by the ordinary quantum ""probabilities"" for a single set of
alternatives. Probabilism, or ascribing probabilities to unconscious aspects of
the world, may be seen to be an aesthemamorphic myth.
  No fundamental correlation or equivalence is postulated between different
perceptions (each being the entirety of a single conscious experience and thus
not in direct contact with any other), so SQM, a variant of Everett's
""many-worlds"" framework, is a ""many-perceptions"" framework but not a
""many-minds"" framework. Different detailed SQM theories may be tested against
experienced perceptions by the typicalities (defined herein) they predict for
these perceptions. One may adopt the Conditional Aesthemic Principle: among the
set of all conscious perceptions, our perceptions are likely to be typical.
