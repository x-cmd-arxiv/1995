affine Lie algebra with central charge $n$ on the moduli space of
$U(n)$-instantons on a four manifold $X$. This generalises work of Nakajima,
who considered the case when $X$ is an ALE space. In particular, this describes
the combinatorial complexity of the moduli space as being precisely that of
representation theory, and thus will lead to a description of the Betti numbers
of moduli space as dimensions of weight spaces. This Lie algebra acts on the
space of conformal blocks (i\.e\., the cohomology of a determinant line bundle
on the moduli space) generalising the ``insertion'' and ``deletion'' operations
of conformal field theory, and indeed on any cohomology theory. In the
particular case of $U(1)$-instantons, which is essentially the subject of this
present paper, the construction produces the basic representation after
Frenkel-Kac. Then the well known quadratic nature of $ch_2$,
  $$ch_2 = \frac{1}{2} c_1\cdot c_1 - c_2 $$
  becomes precisely the formula for the eigenvalue of the degree operator,
i\.e\. the well known quadratic behaviour of affine Lie algebras.

theorem to the case of Calabi-Yau threefolds with canonical singularities. The
deformation space of such a Calabi-Yau threefold is no longer smooth, but the
general principle is that the obstructions to deforming such a threefold are
precisely the obstructions to deforming the singularities of the threefold.
Secondly, these results are applied to smoothing singular Calabi-Yau threefolds
with crepant resolutions. Any such Calabi-Yau threefold with isolated complete
intersection singularities which are not ordinary double points is smoothable.
A Calabi-Yau threefold with non-complete intersection isolated singularities is
proved to be smoothable under much stronger hypotheses.

conditions for Euclidean Maxwell theory in the presence of boundaries. The
corresponding quantum amplitudes are studied by using Faddeev-Popov formalism
and zeta-function regularization, after expanding the electromagnetic potential
in harmonics on the boundary 3-geometry. This leads to a semiclassical analysis
of quantum amplitudes, involving transverse modes, ghost modes, coupled normal
and longitudinal modes, and the decoupled normal mode of Maxwell theory. On
imposing magnetic or electric boundary conditions, flat Euclidean space bounded
by two concentric 3-spheres is found to give rise to gauge-invariant one-loop
amplitudes, at least in the cases considered so far. However, when flat
Euclidean 4-space is bounded by only one 3-sphere, one-loop amplitudes are
gauge-dependent, and the agreement with the covariant formalism is only
achieved on studying the Lorentz gauge. Moreover, the effects of gauge modes
and ghost modes do not cancel each other exactly for problems with boundaries.
Remarkably, when combined with the contribution of physical (i.e. transverse)
degrees of freedom, this lack of cancellation is exactly what one needs to
achieve agreement with the results of the Schwinger-DeWitt technique. The most
general form of coupled eigenvalue equations resulting from arbitrary
gauge-averaging functions is now under investigation.

of the thermal bath on the system: a systematic dyssipative force, which tends
to erase out any initial subcritical configuration, and a random stochastic
force responsible for the fluctuations. We show that the contribution to the
variance $\lgh\phi^2(t)\rg_V$ in a given volume $V$ from any initial
subcritical configuration is quickly damped away and that, in the limit of long
times, $\lgh\phi^2(t)\rg_V$ approaches its equilibrium value provided by the
stochastic force and independent from the viscosity coefficient, as predicted
by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In agreement with some recent claims,
we conclude that thermal fluctuations do not affect the nucleation of critical
bubbles at the onset of the electroweak phase transition making electroweak
baryogenesis scenarios still a viable possibility to explain the primordial

My first goal here is to supply enough theoretical reason to motivate the
experimental test of this effect. I start with an intuitive derivation, then I
introduce a wave-front theory as a theoretical consideration. Logically, the
existence of potential effect implies the existence of the AB effect, but not
vice versa. The purpose of this paper is to provide a physical connection in
the opposite direction.
