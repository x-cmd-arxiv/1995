the formation of protostars. Based on this idea, the protostar formation

$T_{0}$, r.m.s. turbulent velocity $\sigma_{v,0}$ (or its Mach number

striking feature that a single parameter, the luminosity, dictates the rotation

universal RC. At high luminosity, there is a slight discrepancy between the
profiles of RCs and those predicted from the luminous matter (LM)

DM is the only relevant mass component. Some of the derived scaling properties
between dark and luminous galactic structure parameters are: (a) the DM/LM mass
ratio at the optical radius scales inversely with luminosity; (b) the halo core
radius is comparable to the optical radius, but shrinks for lower luminosities;
(c) the central halo density scales as L^{-0.7}; (d) the halo virial mass

the rms galaxy number fluctuations in spheres of radius at $8 \Mpc$, from the
measured angular variance in the APM. The uncertainty in $\sigma_8^{APM}$ has
three main contributions: 8\% from sampling and selection function
uncertainties, 7\% from the uncertainty in the evolution of clustering and 3\%
from the uncertainty in the value of $\Omega_0$. Including all these
contributions, we find $\sigma_8^{APM}$ is in the range $0.78-1.08$. If the
galaxy clustering in the APM evolves as expected from gravitational clustering
of matter fluctuations, then $\sigma_8^{APM}=0.95 \pm 0.07$ ($1.00 \pm 0.08$)

fixed in comoving coordinates $\sigma_8^{APM}=0.83 \pm 0.05$ ($0.87 \pm 0.06$),
closer to the results for nearby IRAS samples. The final uncertainty in the
range of values for the hierarchical amplitudes $S_J\equiv

the highest values for the case of less clustering evolution. We compare our

  accompanying this article","Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 3, (1995), 25-52",,,"cs.AI",,"  There has been evidence that least-commitment planners can efficiently handle
planning problems that involve difficult goal interactions. This evidence has
led to the common belief that delayed-commitment is the ""best"" possible
planning strategy. However, we recently found evidence that eager-commitment
planners can handle a variety of planning problems more efficiently, in
particular those with difficult operator choices. Resigned to the futility of
trying to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a planner
that can be used to study which domains and problems are best for which
planning strategies. In this article we introduce this new planning algorithm,
FLECS, which uses a FLExible Commitment Strategy with respect to plan-step
orderings. It is able to use any strategy from delayed-commitment to
eager-commitment. The combination of delayed and eager operator-ordering
commitments allows FLECS to take advantage of the benefits of explicitly using
a simulated execution state and reasoning about planning constraints. FLECS can
vary its commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also
during the course of a single planning problem. FLECS represents a novel
contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the choice of which
commitment strategy to use while planning. FLECS provides a framework to
investigate the mapping from planning domains and problems to efficient
planning strategies.

electron beams vanishes. In the case of the Standard Model, the crossing point
where the asymmetry changes sign occurs in Born approximation at $\sqrt

of the position of the polarization asymmetry zero to modifications of the SM
trilinear $\gamma W W$ coupling. Given reasonable assumptions for the

backscattered laser beam, we show that the zero point, $\sqrt s_0$, of the

the anomalous couplings of the $W$ to better than the 1\% level at $95\%$ CL.
In addition to the fact that only a limited range of energy is required, the
polarization asymmetry measurements have the important advantage that many of
the systematic errors cancel in taking cross section ratios. The position of
the zero thus provides an additional weapon in the arsenal used to probe
anomalous trilinear gauge couplings.

successful strategy is to keep the volume preserving diffeomorphism as the
manifest symmetry of the theory. The general covariance is recovered by further
imposing the conformal invariance. The proof utilizes BRS formalism in parallel
with Yang-Mills theory. The crucial ingredient of the proof is the relation
between the conformal anomaly and the $\beta$ functions.

worldsheet supersymmetry in tachyon-free string theory, namely the appearance
of a ``misaligned supersymmetry'' in the corresponding spacetime spectrum.
Misaligned supersymmetry is a universal property of (1,0) string vacua which
describes how the arrangement of bosonic and fermionic states at all string
energy levels conspires to preserve finite string amplitudes, even in the
absence of full spacetime supersymmetry. Misaligned supersymmetry also
constrains the degree to which spacetime supersymmetry can be broken without
breaking modular invariance, and is responsible for the vanishing of various
mass supertraces evaluated over the infinite string spectrum.

for $0 \leq n < D/2-1$, integer $n$. These results hold for a large class of
string theories, including critical heterotic strings. For strings lacking
spacetime supersymmetry, these supertrace constraints will be satisfied as a
consequence of a hidden ``misaligned supersymmetry'' in the string spectrum.

the path integral is dominated not by instantons, but by flat connections of

four-manifolds with nonpositive Euler number, which are necessarily not simply
connected. On such manifolds, one finds a single topological invariant,
analogous to the Casson invariant of three-manifolds.

$U(1)$ subgroup of the $O(3)$ symmetry and including a Maxwell term for the
gauge field in the Lagrangian. Adding also a suitable potential one obtains a
field theory of Bogomol'nyi type with topological solitons. These solitons are
stable against rescaling and carry magnetic flux which can take arbitrary
values in some finite interval. The soliton mass is independent of the flux,
but the soliton size depends on it. However, dynamically changing the flux
requires infinite energy, so the flux, and hence the soliton size, remains
constant during time evolution.
