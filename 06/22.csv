our experimental detection efficiency using a range of Monte- Carlo
simulations. Using a `standard' halo density profile we find that a halo
comprised entirely of Machos in the mass range 3 \ten{-4} to 0.06 \msun would
predict > 15 detected events in this dataset; thus a standard spherical halo
cannot be dominated by objects in this mass range. Assuming all three events
are microlensing of halo objects and fitting a naive spherical halo model to
our data yields a Macho halo fraction f =0.19+0.16-0.10, a total mass in Machos
(inside 50 kpc) of 7.6+6-4 \ten{10} \msun, and a microlensing optical depth
8.8+7-5 \ten{-8} (68\% CL). Exploring a wide range of halo models we find that
our constraints on the Macho fraction are quite model-dependent, but
constraints on the total mass in Machos within 50 kpc are quite secure.

microlensing event. Parallax in a gravitational microlensing event observed
only from the Earth appears as a distortion of the lightcurve due to the motion
of the Earth around the Sun. This distortion can be detected if the event
duration is not much less than a year and if the projected velocity of the lens
is not much larger than the orbital velocity of the Earth about the Sun. The
event presented here has a duration of 220 days and clearly shows the
distortion due to the Earth's motion. We find that the projected velocity of
the lens is 75+/-5 km/s at an angle of 28+/-4 deg from the direction of
increasing galactic longitude, as expected for a lens in the galactic disk.
  A likelihood analysis yields estimates of the distance to and mass of the
lens: D_{lens} = 1.7 (+1.1/-0.7) kpc and M = 1.3 (+1.3/-0.6) Msun, suggesting
that the lens is a remnant such as a white dwarf or neutron star. A less likely
possibility is that the lens is a main sequence star. If so, we can add our
upper limit on the observed flux from the lens to the analysis. This modifies
the estimates to: D_{lens} = 2.8 (+1.1/-0.6) kpc, and M = 0.6 (+0.4/-0.2) Msun.

GHz and 8.4 GHz global VLBI data. In addition VLA observations were used to
obtain arsecond resolution continuum and polarization maps at 5 GHz. Both
sources are very asymmetric on the parsec-scale, with a core and a one-sided
jet, aligned with the main arcsecond scale jet. We place a limit on the
milliarcsecond jet to counterjet brightness ratio B$_{jet}$/B$_{cjet}$ \gtsim
20 and \gtsim 30 for B2 0836+29 and 3C465 respectively. For 3C465 the strong
asymmetry holds to the kiloparsec scale. The brightness asymmetry and the ratio
between the core radio power and total radio power allow us to constrain the
jet velocity close to the core and the orientation of the radio structure with
respect to the line of sight. The results suggest that the plasma speed is
relativistic on the parsec scale for both sources, i.e. v$_{jet}$ \gtsim 0.75c
for B2 0836+29 and v$_{jet}$ \gtsim 0.6c for 3C465. While v$_{jet}$ decreases
from the parsec to the kiloparsec scale in B2 0836+29, in 3C465 the very high
v$_{jet}$ holds all the way to the kiloparsec-scale {\t bright spot}. Our
results are in agreement with the unification scheme suggestion that FR-I radio
galaxies are the unbeamed poulation of BL-Lac objects. Furthermore, they
reinforce the idea that the central engine in FR-I and FR-II radio galaxies
must be qualitatively similar. The different radio morphology could then be due
either to an intrinsically different nuclear power, which affects the torus
geometry or to different conditions in the region beyond the parsec scale,
where a significant deceleration in the FR-I jets occurs.

fluctuational path leading from either point attractor to the separatrix (the
most probable escape path, or MPEP) must terminate on the saddle between the
two wells. However, as the parameters of a symmetric double well system are
varied, a unique MPEP may bifurcate into two equally likely MPEP's. At the
bifurcation point in parameter space, the activation kinetics of the system
become non-Arrhenius. In this paper we quantify the non-Arrhenius behavior of a
system at the bifurcation point, by using the Maslov-WKB method to construct an
approximation to the quasistationary probability distribution of the system
that is valid in a boundary layer near the separatrix. The approximation is a
formal asymptotic solution of the Smoluchowski equation. Our analysis relies on
the development of a new scaling theory, which yields `critical exponents'
describing weak-noise behavior near the saddle, at the bifurcation point.

in the Universe and most of the mass in the Galactic halo is dark. Many lines
of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, as yet
undiscovered, weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP). There is now a vast
experimental effort being surmounted to detect WIMPS in the halo. The most
promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background laboratory
detectors and indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos
from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the Earth.
Of the many WIMP candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly the most
theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest superpartner in many
supersymmetric theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the
Standard Model and discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter.
We review in detail how to calculate the cosmological abundance of the
neutralino and the event rates for both direct- and indirect-detection schemes,
and we discuss astrophysical and laboratory constraints on supersymmetric
models. We isolate and clarify the uncertainties from particle physics, nuclear

certain string models contain the needed representations in their massless

Quantum Equivalence Principle for the behaviour of thermal Wightman functions
on an event horizon are analysed in the case of an extremal

avoid the degeneracy of the metric in the stationary coordinates on the
horizon, a method is introduced which employs the invariant length of geodesics
which pass the horizon. First the method is checked for a massless scalar field
on the event horizon of the Rindler wedge, extending the original procedure of
Haag, Narnhofer and Stein onto the {\em whole horizon} and recovering the same
results found by Hessling. Afterwards the HNS prescription and Hessling's
prescription for a massless scalar field are analysed on the whole horizon of
an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m black hole in the limit of a large mass. It
is proved that the weak form of the HNS prescription is satisfyed for all the
finite values of the temperature of the KMS states, i.e., this principle does
not determine any Hawking temperature. It is found that the
Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m vacuum, i.e., $T=0$ does satisfy the weak HNS
prescription and it is the only state which satisfies weak Hessling's
prescription, too. Finally, it is suggested that all the previously obtained
results should be valid dropping the requirements of a massless field and of a
large mass black hole.

calculations using multigrid accelerations and a real-space grid as a basis.
The multigrid methods permit efficient calculations on ill-conditioned systems
with long length scales or high energy cutoffs. The technique has been applied
to systems containing up to 100 atoms, including a highly elongated diamond
cell, an isolated C$_{60}$ molecule, and a 32-atom cell of GaN with the Ga
d-states in valence. The method is well suited for implementation on both
vector and massively parallel architectures.

exactly solvable canonical ensemble model. This model reduces to the results of
an ideal Fermi gas at low temperatures. At higher temperatures, the
fragmentation of the nuclear matter into clusters of nucleons leads to features
that resemble a Bose gas. Some parallels of this model with the phenomena of
Bose condensation and with percolation phenomena are discussed. A simple
expression for the hadronic equation of state is obtained from the model.

vortices. These tend to arrange in a triangular flux-line lattice (FLL) which
is more or less perturbed by material inhomogeneities that pin the flux lines,
and in high-$T_c$ supercon- ductors (HTSC's) also by thermal fluctuations. Many
properties of the FLL are well described by the phenomenological
Ginzburg-Landau theory or by the electromagnetic London theory, which treats
the vortex core as a singularity. In Nb alloys and HTSC's the FLL is very soft
mainly because of the large magnetic penetration depth: The shear modulus of
the FLL is thus small and the tilt modulus is dispersive and becomes very small
for short distortion wavelength. This softness of the FLL is enhanced further
by the pronounced anisotropy and layered structure of HTSC's, which strongly
increases the penetration depth for currents along the c-axis of these uniaxial
crystals and may even cause a decoupling of two-dimensional vortex lattices in
the Cu-O layers. Thermal fluctuations and softening may melt the FLL and cause
thermally activated depinning of the flux lines or of the 2D pancake vortices
in the layers. Various phase transitions are predicted for the FLL in layered
HTSC's. The linear and nonlinear magnetic response of HTSC's gives rise to
interesting effects which strongly depend on the geometry of the experiment.
