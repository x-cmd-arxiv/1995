rugged fitness landscape. Fixed fitness values for each possible genotype are
assigned randomly, with all fit individuals having the same probability of
reproduction. The previously observed transition to a self-organized state of
the population with less recombinational load, implies an abrupt change of
genetic overlap distributions, showing up characteristics of a phase
transition. A crossover variant of the model has a smoother transition to the
adapted regime, with a residual collective adaptation for small values of the
threshold in fitness. When a geographical constraint (shortest possible
distance) on pairwise reproduction in a population arranged one-dimensionally
is imposed, a poised state results, suggestive of self-organized criticality.

the photon flux to a temperature $\go {\rm few} \times 10^5\, K$. Such a gas at

equilibration processes between multiple edge modes. As in the integer quantum
Hall effect (IQHE), inter-mode equilibration is a prerequisite for quantization
of the Hall conductance. Two sources for such equilibration are considered:
Edge impurity scattering and equilibration by the electrical contacts. Several
specific models for electrical contacts are introduced and analyzed. For FQHE
states in which edge channels move in both directions, such as $\nu=2/3$, these
models for the electrical contacts {\it do not} equilibrate the edge modes,
resulting in a non-quantized Hall conductance, even in a four-terminal
measurement. Inclusion of edge-impurity scattering, which {\it directly}
transfers charge between channels, is shown to restore the four-terminal
quantized conductance. For specific filling factors, notably $\nu =4/5$ and
$\nu=4/3$, the equilibration length due to impurity scattering diverges in the
zero temperature limit, which should lead to a breakdown of quantization for
small samples at low temperatures. Experimental implications are discussed.

found, and renormalized by membrane fluctuations. The shape of the phase space

evolution or the evolution time $\tau$ is a distinct concept from the
coordinate time $t = x^0$. Quantization of the theory is also discussed. A
covariant functional Schr\"" odinger equations has a solution for the wave
functional such that it is sharply localized in a certain subspace $P$ of

in which events are existing; (ii) not the whole 4-dimensional space-time, but
only a 3-dimensional section which moves forward in time is accessible to our
immediate experience. The notorious problem of time is thus resolved in our
approach to quantum gravity. Finally we include sources into our unconstrained

mainly into two gluons and new hadrons composed from scalar colour octets are
rather long lived $(\Gamma \leq O(10)Kev)$. For the scalar octet masses $M \geq
O(50)Gev$ scalar octets producing at FNAL or LHC decay into two gluons that
leads to additional four-jet events. We propose to look for scalar octets by
the measurement of the distributions of differential cross sections on the
invariant di-jet masses. Scalar octets naturally arise in models with
compactification of additional space dimensions. In such models the branching
ratio for the scalar octet bound state into two photons is $O(10^{-2})$ that
leads to the events with two photons and two jets. We also point out that the
current experimental data don't contradict to the existence of light ($M \sim
O(1)Gev$) scalar octets. Light scalar octets give additional contribution into
QCD $\beta$-function and allow to improve the agreement between deep inelastic

rise to catastrophic particle production if the oscillation lasts indefinitely;
the produced number of particles exponentially increases without bound as time

the intensity of produced particles are worked out in greatest detail in the

known that correlators of $SL(2)$ current algebra for admissible
representations should reduce to correlators for conformal minimal models. A
precise proposal for this relation has been given at the level of correlators:
When $SL(2)$ primary fields are expressed as $\phi_j(z_n,x_n)$ with $x_n$ being
a variable to keep track of the $SL(2)$ representation multiplet (possibly
infinitely dimensional for admissible representations), then the minimal model
correlator is supposed to be obtained simply by putting all $x_n=z_n$. Although
strong support for this has been presented, to the best of our understanding a
direct, simple proof seems to be missing so in this paper we present one based
on the free field Wakimoto construction and our previous study of that in the
present context. We further verify that the explicit $SL(2)$ correlators we
have published in a recent preprint reduce in the above way, up to a constant
which we also calculate. We further discuss the relation to more standard
formulations of hamiltonian reduction.

product of two word hyperbolic groups along a virtually cyclic subgroup. The
result provides a method of constructing new word hyperbolic group in class
(Q), that is such that all their finitely generated subgroups are quasiconvex.
It is known that free groups, hyperbolic surface groups and most 3-dimensional
Kleinian groups have property (Q). We also give some applications of our
results to one-relator groups and exponential groups.

time-varying electric field in two dimensions is studied using a
group-theoretic approach. We show that this Hamiltonian can be encompassed by
two, commuting SU(2) algebras, and that the two-dimensional problem can
therefore be reduced to two one-dimensional problems. We compare the group
structure for the two-dimensional problem with that previously derived for the
one-dimensional problem, and verify that the Schwinger result is obtained under
the appropriate conditions.

algebras and groups. For a certain type of Hopf algebras the explicit procedure
to construct both classical limits is presented. The canonical forms of
quantized Lie-bialgebras are proved to be two-parametric varieties with two
classical limits called dual. When considered from the point of view of
quantized symmetries such varieties can have boundaries that are noncommutative
and noncocommutative. In this case the quantum duality and dual limits still
exist while instead of Lie bialgebra one has a pair of tangent vector fields.
The properties of these constructions called quantizations of Hopf pairs are
studied and illustrated on examples.

over density operator computations. Quantum state diffusion with a moving basis
(MQSD) provides a practical numerical simulation method which takes full
advantage of the localization of quantum states into wave packets occupying
small regions of classical phase space. Following and extending the original
proposal of Percival, Alber and Steimle, we show that MQSD can provide a
further gain over ordinary QSD and other quantum trajectory methods of many
orders of magnitude in computational space and time. Because of these gains, it
is even possible to calculate an open quantum system trajectory when the
corresponding isolated system is intractable. MQSD is particularly advantageous
where classical or semiclassical dynamics provides an adequate qualitative
picture but is numerically inaccurate because of significant quantum effects.
The principles are illustrated by computations for the quantum Duffing
oscillator and for second harmonic generation in quantum optics. Potential
applications in atomic and molecular dynamics, quantum circuits and quantum
computation are suggested.
