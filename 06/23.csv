indicate significant structure in the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum
above $10^{18}\eV$. A statistically significant dip has been established at
about $5\times10^{18}\eV$. In addition, each experiment observed a different
superhigh energy event above $10^{20}\eV$ separated from the rest of the data
by about half a decade in energy. In this article we discuss what this implies
for the existence or non-existence of the ``Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min cutoff'',
a long lasting and still open question in cosmic ray physics. This cutoff,
caused by energy losses in the cosmic microwave background, is predicted to
occur at a few times $10^{19}\eV$ if cosmic rays are produced by shock
acceleration of lower energy particles at extragalactic distances. We show that
from the spectral point of view, sources nearer than a few $\Mpc$ are still
consistent with the data at the $1\sigma$ level, provided these sources
accelerate particles beyond $3\times10^{20}\eV$. However, persistence of the
apparent gap in the existing data at the level of a 4 times higher total
exposure would rule out a wide range of acceleration models at $98\%$ C.L.,
whether they rely on nearby or extragalactic sources. This might hint to the
existence of a ``top down'' mechanism which produces an additional hard
component of ultrahigh energy particles directly, say, by decay from some
higher energy scale in contrast to bottom up acceleration of charged particles.
In this scenario a cutoff followed by a pronounced spectral flattening and
possibly even a gap could naturally be formed.

the Metropolis algorithm typically move about the distribution being sampled
via a random walk. For the complex, high-dimensional distributions commonly
encountered in Bayesian inference and statistical physics, the distance moved
in each iteration of these algorithms will usually be small, because it is
difficult or impossible to transform the problem to eliminate dependencies
between variables. The inefficiency inherent in taking such small steps is
greatly exacerbated when the algorithm operates via a random walk, as in such a
case moving to a point n steps away will typically take around n^2 iterations.
Such random walks can sometimes be suppressed using ``overrelaxed'' variants of
Gibbs sampling (a.k.a. the heatbath algorithm), but such methods have hitherto
been largely restricted to problems where all the full conditional
distributions are Gaussian. I present an overrelaxed Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm based on order statistics that is more widely applicable. In
particular, the algorithm can be applied whenever the full conditional
distributions are such that their cumulative distribution functions and inverse
cumulative distribution functions can be efficiently computed. The method is
demonstrated on an inference problem for a simple hierarchical Bayesian model.

thermodynamic quantity $P$ in an ensemble of finite systems with quenched

these fluctuations is calculated as a function of the systems' linear size $l$,
focusing on the behavior at the critical point. The specific model considered
is the bond-disordered Ashkin-Teller model on a square lattice. Using Monte
Carlo simulations, several bond-disordered Ashkin-Teller
  models were examined, including the bond-disordered Ising model and the
bond-disordered four-state Potts model. It was found that far from criticality
  the energy, magnetization, specific heat and susceptibility are strongly self
averaging, that is $V_{P}\sim l^{-d}$ (where $d=2$ is the dimension). At
criticality though, the results indicate that the magnetization $M$ and the
susceptibility $\chi$ are non self averaging, i.e. $\frac{V_{\chi}}{\chi^{2}},
  \frac{V_{M}}{M^{2}}\not \rightarrow 0$. The energy $E$ at criticality is
weakly self averaging, that is $V_{E}\sim l^{-y_{v}}$ with $0<y_{v}<d$. Less
conclusively, and possibly only as a transient behavior, the specific heat too
is found to be weakly self averaging. A phenomenological theory of finite size
scaling for disordered systems is developed. Its main prediction is that when
the specific heat exponent $\alpha<0$ ($\alpha$ of the disordered model) then,
for a quantity $P$ which scales as $l^{\rho}$ at criticality, its variance
$V_{P}$ will scale asymptotically as $l^{2\rho+\frac{\alpha}{\nu}}$. we found
very good agreement between the theory and the data for $V_{\chi}$ and $V_{E}$.

lepton-nucleon scatterings and the Drell-Yan processes and their implications
for the spin and flavor contents of the nucleon, we suggest that those

all be accounted for in the chiral quark model of Georgi and Manohar. In our
formulation of the chiral quark model, the $\eta ^{\prime }$ meson is seen to
play an important role.

interacting with single-mode laser light field, in a $q$-analog harmonic
oscillator trap for increasing $q$. For $\tau=.003(q=e^{\tau})$ the collapses
and revivals of population inversion become well defined facilitating
experimental observation but for large $\tau \sim 0.1$ the time dependence of
population inversion is completely wiped out.

and G.A.~Goldin (J.Phys.A 27, 1771) we calculate the complete set of Lie
symmetries. For various subfamilies we find different finite and infinite
dimensional Lie symmetry algebras. Two of the latter lead to a local
transformation linearizing the particular subfamily. One type of these
transformations leaves the whole family of equations invariant, giving rise to
a gauge classification of the family. The Lie symmetry algebras and their
corresponding subalgebras are finally characterized by gauge invariant
parameters.
