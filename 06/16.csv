Accepted for ApJ","ApJ 456, 437 (1996)","10.1086/176668",,"astro-ph",,"  Using ASCA data, we have measured the electron temperature in A2163 out to
1.5h^{-1} Mpc (10a_x) from the center, in three radial bins. The temperatures
are 12.2+1.9-1.2 keV, 11.5+2.7-2.9 keV and 3.8+1.1-0.9 keV (90%) in the 0-3 a_x
(0-3.5'), 3-6 a_x and 6-13 a_x spherical shells, respectively. Applying the
hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry assumptions and using these data
together with the Ginga spectral and the Rosat imaging data, we were able to
severely limit the possible binding mass distribution of the generic form
rho=rho_0 (1+r^2/a_b^2)^{-n/2}. All the allowed binding mass profiles are
steeper than the gas density profiles and mass profiles with the same slope as
gas are excluded at a greater than 99% confidence. The total mass inside
0.5h^{-1} Mpc is 4.3+-0.5 10^14 h^{-1} Msun, of which 0.074 h^{-3/2} is gas
while inside 1.5h^{-1} Mpc the mass is 1.07+-0.13 10^15 h^{-1} Msun.
  We note that in the cluster outer part, the timescale for electron-ion
temperature equlibration is comparable to the merger timescale, so the measured
electron temperature may give an underestimate of the gas pressure there.
Otherwise, if our low temperature is indeed representative of the gas
temperature in the outer shell, the cluster atmosphere should be convectionally
unstable and gas turbulence should exist. Bulk motions of the gas are also
expected during the merger. Their existense would increase the total gas
pressure above that indicated by the observed temperature. Thus, failure of the
""gas follows dark matter"" model, favored by hydrodynamic simulations, may be
due to the neglect of these phenomena, leading to an underestimate of the total
density at large radii.

possibility of obtaining genuinely open universes in some models, we compare
the predictions of cold dark matter (CDM) models in open universes with a
variety of observational information. The spectrum of the primordial curvature
perturbation is taken to be scale invariant (spectral index $n=1$),
corresponding to a flat inflationary potential. We allow arbitrary variation of
the density parameter $\Omega_0$ and the Hubble parameter $h$, and take full
account of the baryon content assuming standard nucleosynthesis. We normalize
the power spectrum using the recent analysis of the two year {\it COBE} DMR
data by G\'{o}rski et al. We then consider a variety of observations, namely
the galaxy correlation function, bulk flows, the abundance of galaxy clusters
and the abundance of damped Lyman alpha systems. For the last two of these, we
provide a new treatment appropriate to open universes. We find that, if one
allows an arbitrary $h$, then a good fit is available for any $\Omega_0$
greater than 0.35, though for $\Omega_0$ close to 1 the required $h$ is
alarmingly low. Models with $\Omega_0 < 0.35$ seem unable to fit observations
while keeping the universe over $10$ Gyr old; this limit is somewhat higher
than that appearing in the literature thus far. If one assumes a value of $h >
0.6$, as favoured by recent measurements, concordance with the data is only
possible for the narrow range $0.35 < \Omega_0 < 0.55$. We have also
investigated $n \neq 1$; the extra freedom naturally widens the allowed
parameter region. Assuming a range $0.9<n<1.1$, the allowed range of $\Omega_0$
assuming $h > 0.6$ is at most $0.30 < \Omega_0 < 0.60$.

gravitationally lensed object, the characteristics of the observed light curve
are influenced by the presence of the light that is not lensed. In this paper
we develop a formalism to quantify the associated effects. We find it useful to
introduce the concept of a ``blended Einstein radius"" and an ``effective
Einstein radius"", to describe the probability that a mass will serve as a lens,
or that a source will be lensed in an observable way. These considerations lead
to generic predictions about the results of gravitational microlensing
experiments. One example is that the optical depth for the lensing of giants is
greater than that for the lensing of main sequence stars; for any given
population of sources and lenses this effect can be quantified. We test and
sharpen these predictions by performing a series of Monte Carlo simulations. We
also outline general methods to (1) test whether specific events which fail to
be fit by point-mass light curves are viable candidates for blended events, (2)
use the effects of blending to learn more about the lensing event than would be
possible if there were no blending, and (3) include the effects of blending
when inferring properties of underlying populations through the statistical
study of lensing events.

insignificant shoulder of 6 events on a background of 2.4 in the mass region
475-550 GeV, there is no evidence for new particle production. Mass limits,

possible if one uses a short-distance b quark mass. We find that using the

the usual $D$-flatness conditions are an artifact of Wess--Zumino gauge. By
using a gauge that preserves $\Gc$ invariance we show that every constant
matter field configuration that extremizes the superpotential is $\Gc$
gauge-equivalent (in a sense that we make precise) to a unique classical
vacuum. This result is used to prove that in the absence of a superpotential
the classical moduli space is the algebraic variety described by the set of all
holomorphic gauge-invariant polynomials. When a superpotential is present, we
show that the classical moduli space is a variety defined by imposing
additional relations on the holomorphic polynomials. Many of these points are

also find that the regular part of the spherical generating function is at most
bilinear in coupling constants of source terms.

projection optics in microlithography systems. Unfortunately fused silica is
not stable under UV irradition and undergoes compaction and color center
formation. The UV damage properties of fused silica have been the subject of a
number of studies. The detailed microscopic mechanism for color center
formation is complex and remains obscure but the fact that compaction must be a
generic property of a glassy system seems to have been overlooked by most
researchers although Krajnovich, et. al., do briefly discuss compaction with
respect to a specific glass model. The purpose of this note is to briefly
discuss how the basic mechanism of compaction follows directly from the modern
theoretical understanding of glassy systems. This understanding of the basic
mechanism of compaction fits the experimental data quite well. It also allows
for the prediction of some of qualitative properties of compaction which have
not so far been experimentally determined, such as, the absence of a minimum
damage threshold for the onset of compaction and the eventual long term
cessation of compaction after sufficient shrinkage has occurred.

Additional initial compression, occurring in central collisions leads most
likely to a qualitatively different multifragmentation mechanism. Recent

interfaces between media of different polarizability. In a stationary
dielectric the zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field excite
virtual two-photon states which become real under perturbation due to motion of
the dielectric. The sonoluminescent bubble is modelled as an optically empty
cavity in a homogeneous dielectric. The problem of the photon emission by a
cavity of time-dependent radius is handled in a Hamiltonian formalism which is
dealt with perturbatively up to first order in the velocity of the bubble
surface over the speed of light. A parameter-dependence of the zero-order
Hamiltonian in addition to the first-order perturbation calls for a new
perturbative method combining standard perturbation theory with an adiabatic
approximation. In this way the transition amplitude from the vacuum into a
two-photon state is obtained, and expressions for the single-photon spectrum
and the total energy radiated during one flash are given both in full and in
the short-wavelengths approximation when the bubble is larger than the
wavelengths of the emitted light. It is shown analytically that the spectral
density has the same frequency-dependence as black-body radiation; this is
purely an effect of correlated quantum fluctuations at zero temperature. The
present theory clarifies a number of hitherto unsolved problems and suggests
explanations for several more. Possible experiments that discriminate this from
other theories of sonoluminescence are proposed.

exemplify this in a setting where there are operators satisfying $[A,

multiboson system. It has been previously observed that the ground state of a
system often can be shown to to be a coherent state. We demonstrate why this
must be so. We close with a discussion of an alternative, effective definition
of displacement-operator squeezed states.
