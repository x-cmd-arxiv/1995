  Journal","Astrophys.J. 453 (1995) 873-882","10.1086/176447",,"astro-ph",,"  The rate at which particles are accelerated by the first-order Fermi
mechanism in shocks depends on the angle, \teq{\Tbone}, that the upstream
magnetic field makes with the shock normal. The greater the obliquity the
greater the rate, and in quasi-perpendicular shocks rates can be hundreds of
times higher than those seen in parallel shocks. In many circumstances
pertaining to evolving shocks (\eg, supernova blast waves and interplanetary
traveling shocks), high acceleration rates imply high maximum particle energies
and obliquity effects may have important astrophysical consequences. However,
as is demonstrated here, the efficiency for injecting thermal particles into
the acceleration mechanism also depends strongly on obliquity and, in general,
varies inversely with \teq{\Tbone}. The degree of turbulence and the resulting
cross-field diffusion strongly influences both injection efficiency and
acceleration rates. The test particle \mc simulation of shock acceleration used
here assumes large-angle scattering, computes particle orbits exactly in
shocked, laminar, non-relativistic flows, and calculates the injection
efficiency as a function of obliquity, Mach number, and degree of turbulence.
We find that turbulence must be quite strong for high Mach number, highly
oblique shocks to inject significant numbers of thermal particles and that only
modest gains in acceleration rates can be expected for strong oblique shocks
over parallel ones if the only source of seed particles is the thermal
background.

populations dominating the $\mu$Jy radio counts: z$>$0.7 early-type galaxies
with radio emission powered by an AGN, intermediate redshift post-starburst
galaxies, and lower redshift blue emission-line objects. From their radio and
optical properties, it is argued that the 11 objects fainter than $I_{AB}>$22.5
are mostly at z$>$1, and one half of them are probably early-type galaxies. We
conclude that $\sim$40 per cent of the $\mu$Jy sources are likely to be at z
$>$1. Between one third and one half of the luminous ellipticals in this field
beyond z = 0.7 show moderately powerful radio emission (P $\sim$ 5 10$^{23}$ W
Hz$^{-1}$) which is at least 10 times more powerful than seen in local samples,
and probably reflects evolution of the activity in their nuclei. Only one
classical starburst galaxy is identified in the sample; the rest of the blue
emission-line objects show optical and radio activity more typical of low power
AGNs than starbursts. The number of post-starbursts at $\mu$Jy levels is
considerably higher than the surface density of mJy starburst galaxies,
suggesting the latter are the parent population of the former. While starburst
galaxies are considered to be major contributors to the mJy radiosources
counts, the majority of the $\mu$Jy radio sources appear to be related to AGN
activity rather than to normal star

in the absence of the azimuthal field. In most cases, the azimuthal field tends
to stabilize the VC instability, although strong fields (Alfv\'en speed of
order the characteristic rotational speed in our incompressible model) are
required for complete stabilization. Stability diagrams are constructed,
indicating critical values of the two fields for instability. We find an
additional strong field instability that arises when the azimuthal Alfv\'en
speed exceeds the characteristic rotational speed. This instability, in the
case of a freely bounded configuration, has certain similarities to the sausage
instability for interpenetrating fields in plasma physics, and may be important
for very massive disks or filamentary molecular clouds. An application to the
L1641 region in Orion A is briefly discussed. Finally, we find that the effect
of a radially varying vertical field (without an azimuthal field) is mainly
stabilizing.

detailed comparisons with the results of direct numerical integrations of the

difficult case of a binary with zero initial eccentricity. In this case, we
show that the eccentricity $\delta e$ induced by the encounter declines in
general as a power-law, $\delta e\propto (a/\rp)^{5/2}$, where $a$ is the
binary semi-major axis and $\rp$ is the periastron distance of the encounter.
This power-law arises from the octupole-level secular perturbation of the
binary. In contrast, non-secular quadrupole-level perturbations induce an
eccentricity change that declines exponentially with $\rp$. These non-secular
effects can become dominant at sufficiently small $\rp$, for a sufficiently
high relative velocity, or for a sufficiently massive perturber. We also derive
cross sections for eccentricity change and compare our results with those of
previous studies based on numerical scattering experiments. Our results have
important implications for a number of astrophysical problems including, in
particular, the evolution of binary millisecond pulsars in globular clusters.

particles (WIMPs) constitute the bulk of the matter in the Universe.
Experimental data, dimensional analysis and Standard Model particle physics are
sufficient to evaluate and compare the performance of detectors searching for
such particles either directly (e.g.\ by their scattering in germanium
detectors), or indirectly (e.g.\ by observing their annihilation into neutrinos
in underground detectors). We conclude that the direct method is superior if
the WIMP interacts coherently and its mass is lower or comparable to the weak
boson mass. In all other cases, i.e.\ for relatively heavy WIMPs and for WIMPs
interacting incoherently, the indirect method will be competitive or superior,
but it is, of course, held hostage to the successful deployment of high energy
neutrino telescopes with effective area in the $\sim10^4$--$10^5$~m$^2$ range
and with appropriately low threshold. The rule of thumb is that a kilogram of
germanium is roughly equivalent to a $10^4$~m$^2$ neutrino telescope, although
the signal-to-noise is, at least theoretically, superior for the neutrino
detector. The energy resolution of the neutrino telescope may be exploited to
measure the WIMP mass and suppress the background. A kilometer-size detector
probes WIMP masses up to the TeV-range, beyond which they are excluded by
cosmological considerations.

is affected by $1/Q$ non--perturbative effects for all values of the angle. On
the contrary, variables like thrust, the $c$ parameter, the heavy jet mass, and

foundation of the relativistic dynamics including the tachyon. An anomalous
sign-factor extracted from the transformation of ${ \sqrt{1-u^{2}/c^{2} } }$
under the Lorentz transformation, which has been always missed in the usual
formulation of the tachyon, has a crucial role in the dynamics of the tachyon.
Due to this factor the mass of the tachyon transforms in the unusual way
although the energy and momentum, which are defined as the conserved quantities
in all uniformly moving systems, transform in the usual way as in the case of
the object moving slower than light ({\it bradyon}). We show that this result
can be also obtained from the least action approach. On the other hand, we show
that the ambiguities for the description of the dynamics for the object moving
with the velocity of light ({\it luxon}) can be consistently removed only by
introducing a new dynamical variable. Furthermore, by using the fundamental
definition of the momentum and energy we show that the zero-point energy for
any kind of the objects, {\it i.e.}, the tachyon, bradyon, and luxon, which has
been known as the undetermined constant, should satisfy some constraints for
consistency, and we note that this is essentially another novel relativistic
effect. Finally, we remark about the several unsolved problems.

  Sequences","7 pages in LaTeX",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.52.3560",,"quant-ph hep-th",,"  We consider the product of infinitely many copies of a spin-$1\over 2$
system. We construct projection operators on the corresponding nonseparable
Hilbert space which measure whether the outcome of an infinite sequence of
$\sigma^x$ measurements has any specified property. In many cases, product
states are eigenstates of the projections, and therefore the result of
measuring the property is determined. Thus we obtain a nonprobabilistic quantum
analogue to the law of large numbers, the randomness property, and all other
familiar almost-sure theorems of classical probability.

interaction between the system and the preparation apparatus.

{\bf 70} (1993)\ 1187] have characterized the set of states of maximal
stability defined as the set of states having minimum entropy increase due to
interaction with an environment, and shown that coherent states are maximal for
the particular environment model examined. To generalize these results, I
consider entropy production within the Lindblad theory of open systems,
treating environment effects perturbatively. I characterize the maximally
predicitive states which emerge from several forms of effective dynamics,
including decoherence from spatially correlated noise. Under a variety of
conditions, coherent states emerge as the maximal states.
