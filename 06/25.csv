evidence that supports a Hubble constant in 70-90 km/s/Mpc range. This
evidence, by and large, probes the expansion of the Universe within 100 Mpc. We
investigate the possibility that the expansion rate within this region is
systematically higher than the true expansion rate due to the presence of a
local, large underdense region or void. We begin by calculating the expected
deviations between the locally measured Hubble constant and the true Hubble
constant for a variety of models. We also discuss the expected correlations
between these deviations and mass fluctuation for the sample volume. We find
that the fluctuations are small for the standard cold dark matter as well as
mixed dark matter models but can be substantial in a number of interesting and
viable nonstandard scenarios. However, deviations in the Hubble flow for a
region of radius 200 Mpc are small for virtually all reasonable models.
Therefore, methods based on supernovae or the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, which
can probe 200 Mpc scales, will be essential in determining the true Hubble
constant. We discuss, in detail, the fluctuations induced in the cosmic
background radiation by voids at the last scattering surface. In addition, we
discuss the dipole and quadrupole fluctuations one would expect if the void
enclosing us is aspherical or if we lie off-center.

  \demo{Problem A} (Gromov, see [5]). Consider a category $M_n$ of closed
manifolds of dimension $n$ with nonzero-degree ways as morphisms. Study a
partial order $M \ge N \Leftrightarrow Mor (M, N) \neq \phi$. For which $N$ the
degrees of maps $f: M \to N$ are bounded for all $M$?
  \demo{Problem B} (Lyndon, [12], problem 13). Extend and relate the theories
of deficiency, the rate of growth and the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic. In
particular, what influence does the deficiency have on the structure of an
infinite group?

which do not involve the first generation have large (up to 1) coupling
constants, $\Lambda$. Such couplings, if exist, could have a number of
phenomenological consequences: renormalization of $b-\tau$ mass ratio,
generation of $\nu_\tau$ mass in MeV region, {\em etc.}. In Grand Unified
models, where $B$- and $L$-violating couplings appear simultaneously, the
proton decay can be forbidden in virtue of hierarchical flavor structure of
$\Lambda.$ However, due to Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing this decay is
induced already in one-loop. Present experimental data give the upper bound
$\Lambda \ltap 10^{-8}$ (or $|\lambda' \lambda''| \ltap 7\cdot 10^{-16},$ on
products of certain $L$- and $B$-violating coupling constants, in more general
context). The bound can be avoided, if there is an asymmetry between the $L$-
and $B$-violating couplings of usual matter fields. In the $SU(5)$ model the
asymmetry can be related to the doublet-triplet splitting.

a number of required theoretical properties, including unitarity. Although
special attention is paid to resonant scatterings involving the $\gamma WW$ and
$ZWW$ vertices in the minimal Standard Model, our approach can be extended to
the top quark or other unstable particles appearing in renormalizable models of
new physics.

  or hardcopy available from the Author",,,"DESY T-95-02","hep-ph",,"  The electroweak phase transition is investigated by means of the
perturbatively calculated high temperature effective potential. An analytic
result to order $g^4,\lambda^2$ is presented for the Abelian Higgs model, the
SU(2)-Higgs model and the standard model and a complete on-shell
renormalization at zero temperature is performed. Higher order corrections are
found to increase the strength of the first order phase transition in the
non-Abelian model, opposite to the Abelian case. This effect is traced back to
the infrared contributions from the typical non-Abelian diagrams. The
dependence of several phase transition parameters on the Higgs mass is analysed
in detail. A new, gauge invariant, approach based on the composite field
$\Phi^\dagger\Phi$ is introduced. This method, which supports the above Landau
gauge results numerically, permits a conceptually simpler treatment of the
thermodynamics of the phase transition. In particular, it enables a
straightforward comparison with lattice data and the application of the
Clausius-Clapeyron equation to the electroweak phase transition.
