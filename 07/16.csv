constant, ($\alpha$), and the quantity $\alpha^2 g_p(m_e/m_p)$, where $g_p$ is
the proton gyromagnetic ratio. These limits are based on extremely high
precision observations of H$_2$, Si$^{3+}$, C$^0$ and H$^0$ in high-redshift
quasar absorption lines. They amount to 95\% confidence ranges of $(-7.6\to
9.7) \times 10^{-14}$ yr$^{-1}$ for ($m_e/m_p$), $(-4.6\to 4.2)\times 10^{-14}$
yr$^{-1}$ for $\alpha$\ and $(-2.2\to 4.2) \times 10^{-15}$ yr$^{-1}$ for
$\alpha^2 g_p(m_e/m_p)$, where the elapsed time has been computed for a
cosmology with \hnought = 75 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and \qnought = 0.5.

states, the localiztion length, the generalized inverse participation ratios,
and the distribution function of eigenvector components for the superposition
of a random band matrix with a strongly fluctuating diagonal matrix. In this
way we extend previously known results for ordinary band matrices to the class
of random band matrices with preferential basis. Our analytical results are in
good agreement with (but more general than) recent numerical findings by
Jacquod and Shepelyansky.

field is of resonance character, and involves a long lifetime excitonic state
of an electron and hole {\it uniformly spread} over cyclotron orbits. We find
that the tunneling gap is linear in the field, in agreement with the
experiment, and is anomalously sensitive to the electron density mismatch in
the wells. The spatial coherence of tunneling along the orbit can be probed by
magnetic field parallel to the plane, which produces an Aharonov-Bohm phase of
the tunneling amplitude, and leads to an oscillatory field dependence of the
current.

$SU(5)\otimes SU(5)\otimes Q_{12}$ symmetry embedding into a fully gauged
$SU(5)\otimes SU(5)\otimes SU(2)$.~\cite{fk} The two $SU(5)$'s contain the
standard SUSY $SU(5)$ as a diagonal subgroup, while the $Q_{12}$ or $SU(2)$ is
horizontal. Starting by assuming a judiciously-chosen set of chiral
supermultiplets, and a pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking, we obtain the
low-energy chiral fermions together with a spectrum of superheavy fermions at
two different scales. The latter mediate Froggatt-Nielsen tree graphs that give
rise to a phenomenologically viable effective quark mass matrix texture. The
model is the first example of a nontrivial combination of supersymmetry without
R-parity, gauged nonabelian horizontal symmetry and
unification/anti-unification. It is expected to have some very interesting
features in SUSY-GUT phenomenology.

theories, and demonstrate that such a representation is completely specified by
a state within the theory. The necessary and sufficient conditions upon this
state are derived, and, because of their form, we show that we may extend the
representation to a representation of a suitable larger conformal field theory.
In particular, we apply this procedure to the lattice (FKS) conformal field
theories, and deduce that Dong's proof of the uniqueness of the twisted
representation for the reflection-twisted projection of the Leech lattice
conformal field theory generalises to an arbitrary even (self-dual) lattice. As
a consequence, we see that the reflection-twisted lattice theories of Dolan et
al are truly self-dual, extending the analogies with the theories of lattices
and codes which were being pursued. Some comments are also made on the general
concept of the definition of an orbifold of a conformal field theory in
relation to this point of view.
