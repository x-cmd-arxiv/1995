perturbation spectrum with the CDM transfer function. Due to the broken scale
invariance ('BSI') characterizing the primordial perturbation spectrum, this
model has less small-scale power than the (COBE-normalized) standard CDM model.
The particle-mesh code (with $512^3$ cells and $256^3$ particles) includes a
model for thermodynamic evolution of baryons in addition to the usual
gravitational dynamics of dark matter. It provides an estimate of the local gas
temperature. In particular, our galaxy-finding procedure seeks peaks in the
distribution of gas that has cooled. It exploits the fact that ``cold""
particles trace visible matter better than average and thus provides a natural
biasing mechanism. The basic picture of large-scale structure formation in the
BSI model is the familiar hierarchical clustering scenario. We obtain particle
in cell statistics, the galaxy correlation function, the cluster abundance and
the cluster-cluster correlation function and statistics for large and small
scale velocity fields. We also report here on a semi-quantitative study of the
distribution of gas in different temperature ranges. Based on confrontation
with observations and comparison with standard CDM, we conclude that the BSI
scenario could represent a promising modification of the CDM picture capable of
describing many details of large-scale structure formation.

dynamically through a set of gauge- and parity-invariant 4-fermion operators.
It is shown that in a model with a composite bi-doublet and two triplet scalars
there is no parity breaking at low energies, whereas in the model with two
doublets instead of two triplets parity is broken automatically regardless of
the choice of the parameters of the model. For phenomenologically allowed
values of the right-handed scale a tumbling symmetry breaking mechanism is
realized in which parity breaking at a high scale $\mu_R$ propagates down and
eventually causes the \EW symmetry breaking at the scale $\mu_{EW}\sim
100~GeV$. The model exhibits a number of low and intermediate mass Higgs bosons
with certain relations between their masses. In particular, the components of
the $SU(2)_L$ Higgs doublet $\chi_L$ are pseudo--\GBs of an accidental
(approximate) $SU(4)$ symmetry of the Higgs potential and therefore are
expected to be relatively light.

moduli space of harmonic maps. The Lagrangian of these harmonic topological
sigma models is of fourth order in worldsheet derivatives. Then we gauge
worldsheet diffeomorphisms by introducing the induced worldsheet metric. This
leads to a topological string theory, whose Lagrangian coincides in the bose
sector with the rigid string Lagrangian discussed some time ago by Polyakov and
others as a candidate for QCD string theory. The path integral of this
topological rigid string theory is localized to the moduli spaces of
minimal-area maps, and calculates their Euler numbers. The dependence of the
large-$N$ QCD partition functions on the target area emerges from measuring the
volume of the moduli spaces, and can be reproduced by adding a Nambu-Goto term
(improved by fermionic terms) to the Lagrangian of the topological rigid
string.
