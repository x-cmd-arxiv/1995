(z$\sim$0.5) and low (z$\sim$0) redshift, has been constructed to study the
effect of environment on radio sources. Comparisons are made between the
properties of FRII sources in cluster and non-cluster environments, and between
X-ray clusters with and without FRII sources. The principal results are the
following:
  1. Most low-redshift FRII sources in clusters appear to be similar to FRII
sources in group or field environments in terms of radio power, optical
properties of the host galaxy, and nonthermal pressure of the radio bridge.
Most low-redshift clusters with FRII sources tend to lie at the lower end of
cluster X-ray luminosity distribution, some having $L_x$ comparable to FRII
sources in non-cluster environments.
  2. High-redshift FRII sources are all quite similar to each other
irrespective of their environments. The nonthermal pressures of their radio
bridges appear to be similar to those of low-redshift FRII's.
  3. The nonthermal pressures of the bridges of FRII sources appear to be
similar to the thermal pressures of the ICM around them. This result would
allow FRII sources to be used as probes of their gaseous environments. The
current data imply that the evolution in the clustering strength around FRII
sources toward high-redshift is likely to be closely linked to an evolution of
the state of the intracluster medium.

When we specialize to $S_3$ as the group of choice, we arrive at the results
that the dominant mass terms are $\lhook $democratic$\rhook $ and that the
ratios of light masses and the Cabbibo angle $\cong ({m_d\over m_s})^{1\over
2}$ are all given by group parameters in the breaking of $S_3$ to $S_2$. A
large mass expansion is then performed and a generalized Wolfenstein
parameterization is given. Further breaking by way of introducing heavy-light
transitions in the down-type mass matrix is here related to the heavy-light
Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa elements.

1000 TeV is presented. The analysis concentrates on calculating radiative
corrections to tree-level mass relations for third generation fermions. The
tree-level relation $m_b/m_{\tau}=1$ predicted by such models can receive large
radiative corrections up to about $50\%$ due to threshold effects at the mass
unification scale. These corrections are thus of about the same importance as
those that give rise to renormalisation group running. The high figure of
$50\%$ can be achieved because 1-loop graphs involving the physical charged
Higgs boson give corrections to $m_{\tau}-m_b$ that are proportional to the
large top quark mass. These corrections can either increase or decrease
$m_b/m_{\tau}$ depending on the value of an unknown parameter. They can also be
made to vanish through a fine-tuning. A related model of tree-level
$t$-$b$-$\tau$ unification which uses the identification of SU(2)$_R$ with
custodial SU(2) is then discussed. A curious relation $m_b \simeq \sqrt{2}
m_{\tau}$ is found to be satisfied at tree-level in this model. The overall
conclusion of this work is that the tree-level relation $m_b = m_{\tau}$ at low
scales such as 1000 TeV or somewhat higher can produce a successful value for
$m_b/m_{\tau}$ after corrections, but one must be mindful that radiative
corrections beyond those incorporated through the renormalisation group can be
very important. This motivates that an on-going search for the rare decays
$K^0_L \to \mu^{\pm} e^{\mp}$ be maintained.

subthreshold energy regime is analyzed with respect to the one--step
($\pi^+n\to K^+\Lambda$) and the two--step ($\pi^+n\to \eta p_1,~ \eta p_2\to
K^+\Lambda$) incoherent production processes on the basis of an appropriate
folding model, which allows one to take into account the various forms of an
internal nucleon momentum distribution as well as on-- and off--shell
propagation of the struck target nucleon. Contrary to proton--nucleus reactions
primary reaction channel is found to be significant practically at all
considered energies. Detailed predictions for the $K^+$ total and invariant
differential cross sections from \piC-- and \piPb--collisions at subthreshold
energies are provided.

where the gauge symmetry is ensured by a quantum group. We show that these
observables are link invariants taking values in a non commutative algebra, the
so called Moduli Algebra. When $\Sigma=S^2$ these link invariants are pure
numbers and are equal to Reshetikhin-Turaev link invariants.

generalization of the Toda lattice equation. We prove the integrability of the
deformation, and give an explicit formula for the solution to the initial value
problem. The formula is obtained by generalizing the orthogonalization
procedure of Szeg\""{o}. Based on the root spaces for simple Lie algebras, we
consider several reductions of the hierarchy. These include not only the
integrable systems studied by Bogoyavlensky and Kostant, but also their
generalizations which were not known to be integrable before. The behaviors of
the solutions are also studied. Generically, there are two types of solutions,
having either sorting property or blowing up to infinity in finite time.
