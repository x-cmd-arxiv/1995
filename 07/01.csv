solutions for the orbits of the mass tracers given their present redshifts and
angular positions and the cosmological boundary condition that the peculiar
velocities are small at high redshift. A solution predicts the distances of the
mass tracers, and is tested by a comparison with measured distances. The
current numerical results use 289 luminosity-linewidth distance measurements
designed to be close to unbiased. A catalog of 1138 tracers approximates the
luminosity distribution of galaxies in the vicinity of the Local Supercluster,
at redshifts cz < 3000 km/s. These mass tracers include groups with crossing
times less than the Hubble time and isolated galaxies. The measure of merit of
a solution is the sum of the mean square differences between the predicted and
observed distance moduli. In the 3000 km/s sample, this reduced $\chi^2$
statistic has a well-defined minimum value at M/L=175 and $t_0 = 10.0$ Gyr, and
$\chi^2$ at the minimum is about 1.29 times the value expected from just the
standard deviation of the distance measurements. We have tested for the effect
of the mass at greater distance by using the positions of Abell clusters as a
model for the large-scale mass distribution. This external mass model reduces
the minimum value of $\chi^2$ by about 10\% ($\sim 1 \sigma$). The value of the
cosmological density parameter $\Omega_0$ is determined by the global mean
mass-to-light ratio. Our preliminary analysis yields $\Omega_0= 0.17 \pm 0.10$
at one standard deviation. A tighter bound is expected to come out of a larger
sample of measured distances now available.

Gutzwiller-Jastrow-type variation method and the exact diagonalization of small
systems. Variational expectation values are estimated by the variational Monte
Carlo method with sufficient accuracy. First, we represent the diagonalization
results. Physical quantities like momentum distribution and some correlation
functions show some behaviors which are not expected in repulsive models, as
the value of $J/t$ increases. These properties as well as energy are well
understood by introducing intersite correlation factors into wave functions.
The phase transition to a separated phase in large-$J/t$ region can be
described by an attractive Jastrow wave function in quantitative agreement with
the exact results. On the other hand, for the supersymmetric case ($J/t=2$) the
original Gutzwiller wave function becomes an extremely good trial function for
all the range of electron density. Here a kind of \lq\lq free electron"" state
is realized, particularly in the low electron density. Next, the above wave
functions are compared with the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid-type wave function
proposed by Hellberg and Mele. It is found that the correlation factors in
short distances control bulk quantities like energy and the magnitude of
correlation functions, while the long-range part of correlataion factors
determines the critical behavior of correlation functions. Lastly, using these
functions, charge and spin susceptibilities and magnetization curve are
estimated, which agree with the exact results. It is shown that the Mott
transition in 1D $t$-$J$ model is quite different from the Brinkman-Rice
transition.

problem solvers. In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a
domain description -- as used in most hierarchical planners -- has proven
useful. In this paper we present examples which illustrate significant
drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome these drawbacks, we
propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of
representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a
related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change
of representation language of planning cases from concrete to abstract.
However, to achieve a powerful change of the representation language, the
abstract language itself as well as rules which describe admissible ways of
abstracting states must be provided in the domain model. This new abstraction
approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement in an Integrated
System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically learned
from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning
in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed
reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning.

So, no quantum corrections to thermodynamics are observed. The possible
relevance of the results obtained to the four-dimensional case is discussed.

their geometrical interpretations -- which arise in the BRST construction of a
conformal string background. Starting from the chiral algebra $\cA$ of a string
background, we consider a number of elementary but universal operations on the
chiral algebra. From these operations we deduce a certain fundamental odd
Poisson structure, known as a Gerstenhaber algebra, on the BRST cohomology of
$\cA$. For the 2D string background, the correponding G-algebra can be
partially described in term of a geometrical G-algebra of the affine plane
$\bC^2$. This paper will appear in the proceedings of {\it Strings 95}.

were performed using density function theory. The results are used to predict
lattice spacings, magnetic moments and elastic properties; these are in good
agreement with experiment for both the bcc and fcc structures. We find however,
that in extracting these quantities great care must be taken in interpreting
numerical fits to the calculated total energies. In addition, the results for
bulk iron give insight into the properties of thin iron films. Thin films grown
on substrates with mismatched lattice constants often have non-cubic symmetry.
If they are thicker than a few monolayers their electronic structure is similar
to a bulk material with an appropriately distorted geometry, as in our trigonal
calculations. We recast our bulk results in terms of an iron film grown on the
(111) surface of an fcc substrate, and find the predicted strain energies and
moments accurately reflect the trends for iron growth on a variety of
substrates.

the chiral quark model. We find that quark model provides a very good
description of the $\eta$ production with much less parameters, and the
threshold region is not a reliable source to determine the $\eta NN$ coupling
constant due to its strong dependence on the properties of the resonance
$S_{11}(1535)$. We suggest that the systematic data in $E_{lab}=1.2 \sim 1.4$
GeV region may help us to determine the $\eta NN$ coupling constant more
precisely.
  The structure of the resonance $S_{11}(1535)$ is discussed, we find that the
recent data from Mainz group bring the helicity amplitude much closer to the
quark model prediction. However, more studies need to be done to understand the
large $\eta N$ branching ratio of the resonance $S_{11}(1535)$. Our results
show that the quark model is a very good approach to study the underlying
structure of baryon resonances from the meson photoproduction data.
