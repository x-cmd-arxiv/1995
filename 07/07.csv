the numerical type of singularities of a plane curve, which involves the degree
of the curve, the multiplicities and the Milnor numbers of its singular points.
It is a corollary of the logarithmic Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau's type inequality
due to Miyaoka. It was first proven by F. Sakai at 1990 and rediscovered by the
authors independently in the particular case of an irreducible cuspidal curve
at 1992. Our proof is based on the localization, the local Zariski--Fujita
decomposition and uses a graph discriminant calculus. The key point is a local
analog of the BMY-inequality for a plane curve germ. As a corollary, a
boundedness criterium for a family of plane curves has been obtained. Another
application of our methods is the following fact: a rigid rational cuspidal
plane curve cannot have more than 9 cusps.

redshift survey, and for the greatest accuracy, the spherical character of the

parallel approximation. In the linear regime, the redshift space correlation
function is described by a spherical distortion operator acting on the true

which is essentially the logarithmic derivative with respect to pair
separation, which both commutes with the spherical distortion operator, and at
the same time defines a characteristic scale of separation. The correlation
function can be expanded in eigenfunctions of this operator, and these
eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of the distortion operator. Ratios of the
observed amplitudes of the eigenfunctions yield measures of the linear growth
rate $\beta$ in a manner independent of the shape of the correlation function.
More generally, the logarithmic derivative $\partial/\partial\ln r$ with
respect to depth $r$, along with the square $L^2$ and component $L_z$ of the
angular momentum operator, form a complete set of commuting operators for the
spherical distortion operator acting on the density. The eigenfunctions of this

  Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/281.1.84",,"astro-ph",,"  We develop an algorithm for setting up initial Gaussian random density and
velocity fields containing one or more peaks or dips, in an arbitrary
cosmological scenario. The intention is to generate appropriate initial
conditions for cosmological N-body simulations that focus on the evolution of
the progenitors of the present-day galaxies and clusters. The procedure is an
application of the direct and accurate prescription of Hoffman & Ribak (1991)
for generating constrained random fields.
  For each peak a total of 21 physical characteristics can be specified,
including its scale, position, density Hessian, velocity, and velocity
gradient. The velocity (or, equivalently, gravity) field constrants are based
on a generalization of the formalism developed by Bardeen et al. (1986). The
resulting density field is sculpted such that it induces the desired amount of
net gravitational and tidal forces.
  We provide a detailed mathematical presentation of the formalism. Afterwards
we provide analytical estimates of the likelihood of the imposed constraints.
Amongst others, it is shown that the tidal field has a strong tendency to align
itself along the principal axes of the mass tensor. The method is illustrated
by means of some concrete examples. In addition to the illustration of
constraint-field correlation functions and how they add up to the mean fields,
followed by illustrations of the variance characteristics of field
realizations, we concentrate in particular on the consequences of imposing
gravitational field constraints (or, equivalent in the linear regime for
growing mode fluctuations, peculiar velocity field constraints).

objects from encounters involving these binaries is as large as that from
encounters between single stars. For example, encounters involving binaries
produce a significant number of blue stragglers in both globular cluster

cross sections for a number of binaries in various stellar populations are then
computed. We consider multiple encounters and the ultimate fate of a population
of binaries fed into the cores of different globular cluster models. We see
that the presence of only a relatively small number of binaries (containing
10\% of the stars) will boost the production rate of
astrophysically-interesting objects by a factor of at least a few over the
rates expected from encounters between single stars. In particular, the ratio
of smothered neutron stars to low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) may be greatly
increased, possibly explaining, in part, the excess of millisecond pulsars

sequences have broad ones. We find two independent transitions: a collapse
transition to compact states and a folding transition from compact states to
the native state. The collapse transition is second order-like, while folding
is first order. The system is also studied as a function of the energy
parameters. In particular, as the average energetic drive toward compactness is
reduced, the two transitions approach each other. At zero average drive,
collapse and folding occur almost simultaneously; i.e., the chain collapses
directly into the native state. At a specific value of this energy drive the
folding temperature falls below the glass point, indicating that the chain is
now trapped in local minimum. By varying one parameter in this simple model, we
obtain a diverse array of behaviors which may be useful in understanding the
different folding properties of various proteins.

  predictions for the origin of density fluctuations and for the cosmological
  constant; 23 pages; 3 figures can be faxed on request",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph hep-th",,"  After reviewing the general ideas of quantum cosmology (Wheeler-DeWitt
equation, boundary conditions, interpretation of $\psi$), I discuss how these
ideas can be tested observationally. Observational predictions differ for
different choices of boundary conditions. With tunneling boundary conditions,
$\psi$ favors initial states that lead to inflation, while with Hartle-Hawking
boundary conditions it does not. This difficulty of the Hartle-Hawking wave
function becomes particularly severe if the role of `inflatons' is played by
the moduli fields of superstring theories. In models where the constants of
Nature can take more than one set of values, $\psi$ can also determine the
probability distribution for the constants. This can be done with the aid of
the `principle of mediocrity' which asserts that we are a `typical'
civilization in the ensemble of universes described by $\psi$. The resulting
distribution favors inflation with a very flat potential, thermalization and
baryogenesis at electroweak scale, a non-negligible cosmological constant, and
density fluctuations seeded either by topological defects, or by quantum
fluctuations in models like hybrid inflation (as long as these features are
consistent with the allowed values of the constants).

class of one--loop degeneracies that has been reported in a previous work is
lifted in two--loop order. One-- and two--loop results lead to the conjecture
that the spectrum possesses a remarkable hierarchical structure: The naive sum
of any two anomalous dimensions generates a limit point in the spectrum, an
anomalous dimension plus a limit point generates a limit point of limit points
and so on. An infinite hierarchy of such limit points can be observed in the
spectrum.

theory in the Wess-Zumino gauge is presented, using the regulator free
``algebraic renormalization'' procedure. Both gauge invariance and
supersymmetry are included into one single BRS invariance. The form of the
general nonabelian anomaly is given. Furthermore, it is explained how the gauge
BRS and the supersymmetry functional operators can be extracted from the
general BRS operator. It is then shown that the supersymmetry operators
actually belong to the closed, finite, Wess-Zumino superalgebra when their
action is restricted to the space of the ``gauge invariant operators'', i.e. to
the cohomology classes of the gauge BRS operator. An erratum is added at the

allows to develop a theory of local von Neumann algebras on the punctured

constructed by means of Bogoliubov transformations. Using CAR theory, the

supersymmetry algebra in four dimensions is reviewed: while some have a
standard Kaluza-Klein interpretation as momenta in compact dimensions, most
arise from $p$-form charges in the higher-dimensional supersymmetry algebra
that are carried by $p$-brane `solitons'. Although $p=1$ is singled out by
superstring perturbation theory, U-duality of N=8 superstring compactifications
implies a complete `$p$-brane democracy' of the full non-perturbative theory.
An `optimally democratic' perturbation theory is defined to be one in which the
perturbative spectrum includes all particles with zero magnetic charge. Whereas
the heterotic string is optimally democratic in this sense, the type II
superstrings are not, although the 11-dimensional supermembrane might be.
