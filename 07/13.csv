means that sub-horizon processes can generate significant power on scales
further outside the horizon than one might naively expect. The existence of

spectroscopically classifying galaxies from the low signal-to-noise (S/N)
optical spectra typical of galaxy redshift surveys. First, using \chi^2-fitting
of characteristic templates to the object spectrum, we determine the relative
contributions of the old stellar component, the young stellar component, and
various emission line spectra. Then, we classify the galaxy by comparing the
relative strengths of the components with those of galaxies of known
morphological type. In particular, we use the ratios of (1) the emission line
to absorption line contribution, (2) the young to old stellar contribution, and
(3) the oxygen to hydrogen emission line contribution. We calibrate and test
the method using published morphological types for 32 galaxies from the
long-slit spectroscopic survey of Kennicutt (1992) and for 304 galaxies from a
fiber spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxy clusters. From an analysis of a
sample of long-slit spectra of spiral galaxies in two galaxy clusters, we
conclude that the majority of the galaxies observed in the fiber survey are
sufficiently distant that their spectral classification is unaffected by
aperture bias. Our spectral classification is consistent with the morphological
classification to within one type (e.g. E to S0 or Sa to Sb) for \gtsim 80% of
the galaxies. Disagreements between the spectral and morphological
classifications of the remaining galaxies reflect a divergence in the
correspondence between spectral and morphological types, rather than a problem
with the data or method.

smooth component of the universe since it resolves the so-called
``$\Omega$-problem'' giving, at the same time, sufficiently large age of the
universe. However, the constant $\Lambda$-term is not the only possibility.
Some people consider the $\Lambda$-term varying in time according to the law
$\Lambda\approx R^{-2}$. Moreover the global texture in a closed universe and
the network of cosmic strings obeying the same law of variation ($\rho\approx
R^{-2}$) seem to be good candidates as well. We call the ``exotic'' form of
matter scaling according to this law -- string-like matter. In the paper we
discuss perturbation growth and anisotropies of the CMB in the string-like
dominated universe. One can show that the perturbations cannot grow in the
curvature dominated universe. Since the energy density of the string-like
matter scales with the expansion in the same way as the curvature term one
asserts that the perturbations cannot grow in the string-like matter dominated
universe either. We find this generally accepted statement not quite correct
and one of the purposes of the paper is to clear up this point. The second
purpose of the paper is to check whether the eventual existence of the
string-like matter may have an impact on the large-angular-scale anisotropies
of the CMB. We show that such exotic matter has no effect on the value of the
anisotropy amplitude $\delta T/T(theta).$

paramagnetic phase are examined within the framework of Random Phase
Approximation(RPA). Itinerant carriers with spin interact with each other via
an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction. Then there appear three
fundamental scattering processes;a) scattering between parallel spins,b)
scattering between antiparallel spins and c) scattering with spin-flip. To
examine how these scattering processes affect the dynamical spin fluctuations,
we pick up carefully all possible combination of RPA diagrams in a consistent
manner and take the spin rotational symmetry into account. Then it becomes
clear that we have to take up a sequence of the irreducible single loop which
in itself is modified due to the particle-hole ladder type vertex correction.We
set up the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the vertex correction and show that this
can be solved in a closed form due to separable nature of the antiferromagnetic
interaction. We evaluated numerically the effectof the vertex correction and
found that the correction is negligibly small. Therefore we propose that in an
itinerant Heisenberg system, including the $t$-$J$ model as its derivertive,
the simplified RPA, where the irreducible single loop is unrenormalized, works
very well. This conclusion strongly support the simplified treatment which is
widely used in High-$T_{c}$ problem. Moreover the present formalism enables us
to proceed further microscopic calculations on the magnetic properties in the
current High-$T_{c}$ problem.

the deeply inelastic scattering process in current literature. The conventional
fixed-flavor scheme focuses on the flavor creation mechanism and includes the
heavy quark only as a final state particle in the hard scattering cross
section; this has been computed to next-to-leading order--\alphas^2. The more
recently formulated variable-flavor scheme includes, in addition, the flavor
excitation process where the initial state partons of all flavors contribute
above their respective threshold, as commonly accepted for calculations of
other high energy processes; this was initially carried out to leading
order--\alphas^1. We first compare and contrast these existing calculations. As
expected from physical grounds, the next-to-leading-order fixed-flavor scheme
calculation yields good results near threshold, while the leading-order
variable-flavor scheme calculation works well for asymptotic Q^2. The quality
of the calculations in the intermediate region is dependent upon the x and Q^2
values chosen. An accurate self-consistent QCD calculation over the entire
range can be obtained by extending the variable-flavor scheme to
next-to-leading-order. Recent work to carry out this calculation is described.
Preliminary numerical results of this calculation are also presented for
comparison.

within the framework of the diquark model in which protons are viewed as being
built up by quarks and diquarks. The latter objects are treated as
quasi-elementary constituents of the proton. Virtual Compton scattering,
electroproduction of photons and the Bethe-Heitler contamination are discussed
for various kinematical situations. We particularly emphasize the r\^ole of the
electron asymmetry for measuring the relative phases between the virtual
Compton and the Bethe-Heitler amplitudes. It is also shown that the model is
able to describe very well the experimental data for real Compton scattering
off protons.

solution of the leading order equation of the strong field approximation
(M.Frasca, Phys. Rev. A, {\bf 45}, 43 (1992)) can be derived by the adiabatic
approximation. In fact, it is shown that greatest is the perturbation and more
similar the quantum system is to an adiabatic one, the solution being written
as a superposition of eigenstates of the time-dependent perturbation.A direct
consequence of this result is that the solution of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation
in the interaction picture, in the same approximation for the perturbation,
coincides with the one of the leading order of the strong field approximation.
The limitation due to the requirement that the perturbation has to commute at
different times is so overcome. Computational difficulties could arise to go to
higher orders. Beside, the method is not useful for perturbations that are
constant in time. In such a case a small time series is obtained, indicating
that this approximation is just an application to quantum mechanics of the
Kirkwood-Wigner expansion of statistical mechanics. The theory obtained in this
way is applied to a time-dependent two-level spin model, already considered for
the study of the Berry's phase, showing that a geometrical phase could arise if
a part of the hamiltonian is considered as a strong perturbation. No adiabatic
approximation is taken on the parameters of the hamiltonian, while their
cyclicity is retained.
