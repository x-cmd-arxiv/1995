relies upon a lexicon of allomorphs both for stems and morphemes. Word forms
are built by the concatenation of allomorphs by means of special contextual
features. We make use of standard Definite Clause Grammars (DCG) included in

allows us to take advantage of the declarativity and bidirectionality of Logic
Programming for NLP.

straightforward rule and lexical components. We have developed a very simple
model for complex phenomena.
  Declarativity, bidirectionality, consistency and completeness of the model

alternative ones and gaps in paradigms are preserved. A Prolog implementation
has been developed for both analysis and generation of Spanish word forms. It
consists of only six DCG rules, because our {\em lexicalist\/} approach --i.e.

combining a reconstruction operation and a mechanism of anaphoric reference.

  Superconductors","37 pages, latex , 16 figures available upon request to
  varelogi@venus.roma1.infn.it",,,,"cond-mat",,"  We consider the Eliashberg theory in the coupling region where some
fundamental qualitative deviations from the conventional BCS-like behaviour
begin to appear. These deviations are identified as the onset of a cross-over
from BCS superconductivity to Bose condensation. We point out that the
beginning of this cross-over occurs when the gap $\Delta_g$ becomes comparable
to the boson energies $\Omega_{ph}$. This condition is equivalent to the
condition of Ref. \cite{Strinati} $k_F\xi\approx 2\pi$ and traduces the
physical constraint that the distance the paired electron covers during the
absorbtion of the virtual boson, cannot be larger than the coherence length.
The frontier region of couplings is of the order of $\lambda\approx 3$, and
high-$T_c$ materials are concerned. A clear qualitative indication of the
occurence of a cross-over regime should be a dip structure above the gap in the
density of states of excitations. Comparing our results with tunneling and
photoemission experiments we conclude that high-$T_c$ materials (cuprates and
fullerides) are indeed at the beginning of a cross-over from BCS
superconductivity to Bose condensation, even though the fermionic nature still
prevails. Taking into account the analysis of Ref. \cite{Strinati}, we predict
a dip structure in heavy fermion and organic superconductors. Non-adiabatic
effects beyond Migdal's theory are considered and give insight on the
robustness of Eliashberg theory in describing qualitatively this cross-over
regime, although for the quantitative interpretation of the results the
inclusion of non-adiabatic corrections can be important.

  at the 3rd Alexander Friedmann international seminar on gravitation and

probabilities of configurations with different topology and dimension in
quantum cosmology. Assuming the semiclassical approximation, the usual formula
for the nucleation probability induced by the no-boundary wave function is
$P_{NB}\approx\exp(-I)$, where $I$ is the Euclidean action, evaluated at a
solution of the Euclidean Einstein equations with effective cosmological
constant $\Lambda$. Relative probabilities of different configurations are
usually compared at equal values of $\Lambda$. When configurations with
different dimensions are admitted (the $n$-dimensional gravitational constant
being subject to a rather mild restriction), as e.g. ${\bf S}^n$ for any $n$,
this procedure leads to the prediction that the space-time dimension tends to
be as large as possible. In this contribution, I would like to propose an
alternative scheme, namely to compare the probabilities $P_{NB}\approx\exp(-I)$
at equal values of the {\it energy} $E$, instead of the {\it energy density}
$\Lambda$. As a result, the space-time dimension settles at $n=4$. Attempts to
predict the topology of the spacelike slices lead to the candidates ${\bf S}^3$
and ${\bf S}^1\times {\bf S}^2$. Since the ''process'' of nucleation (possibly
connected with decoherence) is not well known in detail, we expect that either
{\it both} configurations may be realized with roughly equal probability, or
the {\it latter} one is favoured. Finally, we comment on the analogous
situation based on the tunneling wave function.

Isgur and Wise. We find the lower bound of $\rho^2$ in such models to be $3/4$
for ground state mesons, independently of any parameter. Another welcome
property of these models is that in the infinite momentum limit the wave
functions vanish outside the domain $0\le x \le 1$.

experiments.

new physics contributes to neutrino masses, neutrino interactions are given by

appearance experiment with sensitivity to oscillation probability
$P_{ij}^{exp}$ can detect new physics in neutrino interactions if its strength
$G_N$ satisfies $(G_N/G_F)^2 \sim P_{ij}^{exp}$. Using our formalism we show
how current experiments on neutrino oscillation give bounds on the new
interactions in various new physics scenarios.

that the Rarita-Schwinger field equations are the square root of the full
linearized Einstein field equations in order to investigate the form of the
interaction for the spin $3/2$ field with gauge fields. We deduce the form of
the interaction terms for the electromagnetic and non-Abelian Yang-Mills fields
by implementing appropiate energy momentum tensors on the linearized Einstein
field equations. The interaction found for the electromagnetic case happens to
coincide with the dipole term found by Ferrara {\it et al} by a very different
procedure, namely by demanding $g=2$ at the tree level for the electromagnetic
interaction of arbitrary spin particles. The same interaction is found by using
the resource of linearized Supergravity N=2. For the case of the Yang-Mills
field Supergravity N=4 is linearized, providing the already foreseen
interaction.

exist for a continuous family of velocities, we show that the selected velocity

no instability to transverse perturbations, while a threshold mean field theory
has such a Mullins-Sekerka instability. These results place on firm theoretical
ground the observed lack of the dendritic morphology in naive mean field theory
and its presence in threshold models. The existence of a Mullins-Sekerka

zero-undercooling limit.
