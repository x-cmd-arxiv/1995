a simple cohomological condition for the central fibre to be at finite

would herald a new era in astronomy and in fundamental physics. Ever since the
early sixties, increasingly larger human and material resources are being
invested in the detection effort. Unfortunately, the gravity wave effects one
has had to exploit so far are extraordinarily small and are usually very many
orders of magnitude smaller than the noise involved. The detectors that are
presently at the most advanced stage of development hope to register extremely
rare, instantaneous longitudinal shifts that are expected to be orders of
magnitude smaller than one Fermi. However, it was recently shown that gravity
waves can manifest themselves through much larger effects than previously
envisaged. One of these new effects is the periodic, apparent shift in a star's
angular position due to a foreground gravity wave source. The comparative
largeness of this effect stems from its being proportional not to the inverse
of the gravity wave source's distance to the Earth, but to the inverse of its
distance to the star's line of sight. In certain optimal but not unrealistic
cases, the amplitude of this effect can reach the critical bar of one
micro-arcsecond, thus raising the prospect that the long awaited first direct
detection of gravity waves could be achieved by a high precision astrometry
space mission such as GAIA.

dynamics. They are a common approach to the computing of quantum mechanical
groundstates, and serve as models for population dynamics and as physical

  On a computer the efficiency of this simulation method is limited by the
approach to the infinitesimal time step, which is necessary to perform
alternating diffusion and branching steps.
  In this paper, a method is described, which eliminates the infinitesimal time
step for a certain class of branching processes, if the process of interest can
be ``embedded'' into another process, which is solvable by other analytic
and/or numerical methods. The simplest choice for the embbeding process is
given by a process with a constant branching rate, which dominates the rate of
the embedded process.

not obtained when only a parametric dependence of the vertices on the density
is assumed. It is shown that the approach is energy--momentum conserving and
thermodynamically consistent. Solutions of the field equations are studied in

infinite nuclear matter and finite nuclei are discussed. Density dependent
