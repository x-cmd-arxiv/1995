clusters of galaxies from the Doppler shift of scattered cosmic microwave
background (CMB) photons. We find that if the core radius of the gas
distribution or the beam size of the instrument is larger than 3-7 arcminutes,
then the maximum attainable signal-to-noise ratio is determined by confusion
with primary fluctuations. For smaller angular scales, ``cosmic confusion'' is
less important and instrumental noise and/or foreground emission will be the
limiting factor. For a cluster with the optical depth of the Coma cluster and
for an optimal filtering technique, typical one-sigma errors span the wide
range from 400 to 1600 km/s, depending on the cosmological model, the
resolution of the instrument and the core radius of the cluster. The results
have important implications for the design of future high-resolution surveys of
the CMB. Individual peculiar velocities will be measurable only for a few fast
moving clusters at intermediate redshift unless cosmic fluctuations are smaller
than most standard cosmological scenarios predict. However, a reliable
measurement of bulk velocities of ensembles of X-ray bright clusters will be
possible on very large scales (100-500 Mpc/h).

have secure redshifts with median <z> ~ 0.56. The tri-variate luminosity
function phi(M,color,z) shows unambiguously that the population evolves and
that this evolution is strongly differential with color and, less strongly,
with luminosity. The luminosity function of red galaxies shows very little
change in either number density or luminosity over the entire redshift range 0
< z < 1. In contrast, the luminosity function of blue galaxies shows
substantial evolution at redshifts z > 0.5. By 0.5 < z < 0.75, the blue
luminosity function appears to have uniformly brightened by approximately 1
mag. At higher redshifts, the evolution appears to saturate at the brightest
magnitudes but continues at fainter levels leading to a steepening of the
luminosity function. A significant excess of galaxies relative to the Loveday
et al. (1992) local luminosity function is seen at low redshifts z < 0.2 around
M(B) ~ -18$ and these galaxies may possibly represent the descendants of the
evolving blue population seen at higher redshifts. The changes seen in the
luminosity function are also apparent in color-magnitude diagrams constructed
at different epochs and in the V/V_max statistic computed as a function of
spectral type. Finally, it is argued that the picture of galaxy evolution
presented here is consistent with the very much smaller samples of field
galaxies that have been selected in other wavebands, and with the results of
studies of galaxies selected on the basis of Mg II 2799 absorption.

the same devices used for multiple purposes: (1) the same type of morphological
process (for example, suffixation for both noun case and verb tense) and (2)
identical morphemes (for example, the same suffix for English noun plural and
possessive). These sorts of similarity would be expected to convey advantages
on language learners in the form of transfer from one morphological category to
another. Connectionist models of morphology acquisition have been faulted for
their supposed inability to represent phonological similarity across
morphological categories and hence to facilitate transfer. This paper describes
a connectionist model of the acquisition of morphology which is shown to
exhibit transfer of this type. The model treats the morphology acquisition
problem as one of learning to map forms onto meanings and vice versa. As the
network learns these mappings, it makes phonological generalizations which are
embedded in connection weights. Since these weights are shared by different
morphological categories, transfer is enabled. In a set of experiments with
artificial stimuli, networks were trained first on one morphological task
(e.g., tense) and then on a second (e.g., number). It is shown that in the
context of suffixation, prefixation, and template rules, the second task is
facilitated when the second category either makes use of the same forms or the
same general process type (e.g., prefixation) as the first.

$t^{1/6}$ relaxation of the penetration front at early times. The crossover
length between these two regimes is approximately the width of a single layer.
However, for a large number of lamellae there is a cooperative effect which
leads to a large enhancement of this crossover length.

the second favors the rotation of the local bond-orientational order and leads
to a braiding of the polymers along an average direction. In the former case

characterized by power-law envelopes of wave functions, $|\psi_t(r)|^2\propto
r^{-2\mu}$, $\mu <1$. The pre-localized states in short quasi-1D wires have the
power-law tails $|\psi (x)|^2\propto x^{-2}$, too, although their IPN's

production of about $1\%$ for the shallower AMANDA and Lake Baikal detectors,
these instruments can, for a typical GRO source, match the detection efficiency
of a GeV satellite detector since their effective area is larger by a factor
$10^4$. The muons must have enough energy for accurate reconstruction of their
direction. Very energetic muons on the other hand are rare because they are
only produced by higher energy gamma rays whose flux is suppressed by the
decreasing flux at the source and by absorption on interstellar light. We show
that there is a window of opportunity for muon astronomy in the 100~GeV energy

quantum and statistical-kinetic properties of non-equilibrium multi-parton
systems produced in high-energy QCD processes. The approach provides the means
to follow the quantum dynamics in both space-time and energy-momentum, starting
from an arbitrary initial configuration of high-momentum quarks and gluons.
Using a generalized functional integral representation and adopting the
`closed-time-path' Green function techniques, a self-consistent set of
equations of motions is obtained: a Ginzburg-Landau equation for a possible
color background field, and Dyson-Schwinger equations for the 2-point functions
of the gluon and quark fields. By exploiting the `two-scale nature' of
light-cone dominated QCD processes, i.e. the separation between the quantum
scale that specifies the range of short-distance quantum fluctuations, and the
kinetic scale that characterizes the range of statistical binary inter-
actions, the quantum-field equations of motion are converted into a correspon-
ding set of `renormalization equations' and `transport equations'. The former
describe renormalization and dissipation effects through the evolution of the
spectral density of individual, dressed partons, whereas the latter determine
the statistical occurrence of scattering processes among these dressed partons.
The renormalization equations and the transport equations are coupled, and
hence must be solved self-consistently. This amounts to evolving the
multi-parton system, from a specified initial configuration, in time and full
7-dimensional phase-space. This description provides a proba- bilistic
interpretation and is therefore of important practical value for the solution
of the dynamical equations of motion, e.g. by Monte Carlo simulation.

involving fermions, ghosts, as well as positive and negative level
Wess-Zumino-Witten fields, we show that the BRST conditions become restrictions
on the conformally invariant sector, as described by a G/G topological theory.
By solving the corresponding cohomology problem we are led to a finite set of
vacua. For G=SU(2) these vacua are two-fold degenerate.

and heterotic string models by analysing a class of higher dimensional
interactions in the respective low-energy Lagrangians. These are $F$-terms of
the form $F_g W^{2g}$ where $W$ is the gravitational superfield. On the type II
side these terms are generated at the $g$-loop level and in fact are given by
topological partition functions of the twisted Calabi-Yau sigma model. We show
that on the heterotic side these terms arise at the one-loop level. We study in
detail a rank 3 example and show that the corresponding couplings $F_g$ satisfy
the same holomorphic anomaly equations as in the type II case. Moreover we
study the leading singularities of $F_g$'s on the heterotic side, near the
enhanced symmetry point and show that they are universal poles of order
$2g{-}2$ with coefficients that are given by the Euler number of the moduli
space of genus-$g$ Riemann surfaces. This confirms a recent conjecture that the
physics near conifold singularity is governed by $c{=}1$ string theory at the
self-dual point.

collisions is predicted to supercool at the late stages of its evolution. The
thermal energy is then transformed into the potential energy associated with an
energetically unfavorable field configuration. Since the system is in an
unstable state it eventually rolls down to the true minimum of the effective
chiral potential. When this motion is described in terms of the sigma-model, we
find that the energy of the coherent $\sigma-$field is very efficiently
converted into pionic excitations due to anharmonic oscillations around this
minimum. The system is expected to partially thermalize before its
disintegration.

on $P$ be a continuous function of the holonomies of $A$ along finitely many
piecewise smoothly immersed curves in $M$, and let a generalized measure on

generalized measure on the space of connections that extends the uniform
measure of Ashtekar, Lewandowski and Baez to the smooth case, and prove it is
invariant under all automorphisms of $P$, not necessarily the identity on the
base space $M$. Using `spin networks' we construct explicit functions spanning
the corresponding Hilbert space $L^2(\A/\G)$, where $\G$ is the group of gauge
