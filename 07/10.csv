sources. At telescopes, this change in direction appears as periodic variations
in the apparent positions of these sources on the sky; that is, as proper
motion. A wave of a given phase, traveling in a given direction, produces a
characteristic pattern of proper motions over the sky. Comparison of observed
proper motions with this pattern serves to test for the presence of
gravitational waves. A stochastic background of waves induces apparent proper
motions with specific statistical properties, and so, may also be sought. In
this paper we consider the effects of a cosmological background of
gravitational radiation on astrometric observations. We derive an equation for
the time delay measured by two antennae observing the same source in an
Einstein-de Sitter spacetime containing gravitational radiation. We also show
how to obtain similar expressions for curved Friedmann-Robertson-Walker

not exclude the hypothesis that the ratio between galaxy and gas energy density

the value of beta=1, corresponding to energy equipartition, is acceptable.

fixed by the Gell-Mann, Oakes and Renner relation, the pion- nucleon

saturation density $\rho_0$. We find the resulting scalar and vector

describe a decrease of the meson mass with baryon density. The imaginary part
of the hadron selfenergies is determined by a string fragmentation model which
accounts for the in-medium mass of hadrons in line with the 'chiral' dynamics
employed. The applicability of the transport approach is demonstrated in
comparison with experimental data from SIS to SPS energies. The enhancement of
