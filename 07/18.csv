into account the lower fraction of bursts with well-determined positions.
Combining the two data sets, I find that the odds favoring repeating over

hopping regime, caused by quantum interference effects in three dimensions.
When no spin-orbit scattering is included, there is an increase in the
localization length (as in two dimensions), producing a large positive MC. By
contrast, with spin-orbit scattering present, there is no change in the
localization length, and only a small increase in the overall tunneling
amplitude. The numerical data for small magnetic fields $B$, and hopping
lengths $t$, can be collapsed by using scaling variables $B_\perp t^{3/2}$, and
$B_\parallel t$ in the perpendicular and parallel field orientations
respectively. This is in agreement with the flux through a `cigar'--shaped
region with a diffusive transverse dimension proportional to $\sqrt{t}$. If a
single hop dominates the conductivity of the sample, this leads to a
characteristic orientational `finger print' for the MC anisotropy. However, we
estimate that many hops contribute to conductivity of typical samples, and thus
averaging over critical hop orientations renders the bulk sample isotropic, as
seen experimentally. Anisotropy appears for thin films, when the length of the
hop is comparable to the thickness. The hops are then restricted to align with
the sample plane, leading to different MC behaviors parallel and perpendicular
to it, even after averaging over many hops. We predict the variations of such
anisotropy with both the hop size and the magnetic field strength. An
orientational bias produced by strong electric fields will also lead to MC
anisotropy.

fourth-family quark and lepton spectrum, and $\tanb\lsim 3$. The lightest
CP-even Higgs mass is increased. Fourth-family Yukawa coupling contributions to
the evolution of scalar masses lead to unexpected mass hierarchies; \eg\ the
$\staupone$ is generally the lightest slepton and the lightest squark is the
$\wt\bpr_1$. A significant lower bound is placed on the gluino mass by the
requirement that the $\staupone$ not be the LSP. Sleptons of the first two
families are much more massive compared to the LSP and other neutralinos and
charginos than in the three-family models, and could easily lie beyond the
reach of a $\sqrt s=500\gev$ $\epem$ collider. Relations between slepton masses

generation. The most important near-future experimental probes of the

neutral $B\to \pi\pi, \pi K$ and $\bar K K$ decays arising from the
interference of tree and penguin (strong and electroweak) amplitudes with
different strong and CKM phases. The perturbative strong (electroweak) phases
develop at order $\alpha_s$ ($\alpha_{em}$) from absorptive parts of one-loop
matrix elements of the next-to-leading (leading) logarithm corrected effective
Hamiltonian. The BSW model is used to estimate the hadronic matrix elements.
Based on this model, we find that the effect of strong phases and penguins is
substantial in most channels, drastic in many. However, a measurement of the
time dependence parameter $a_{\epsilon+\epsilon'}$ in the $\pi^+\pi^-$ channel
is only influenced at the 20\% level by the complication of the penguins.
Recent flavor sum rules developed for $B^{0,\pm} \rightarrow \pi\pi, \pi K, K
\bar K$ amplitudes are tested in this model. Some are well satisfied, others
badly violated, when electroweak penguins are included.

freedom are necessary to describe the system, due to the requirement of phase
quantization along the superconducting loop constituting the device.
Generalization to multijunction parallel arrays is straightforward.
