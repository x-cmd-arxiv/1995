general relativity. For problems of interest to cosmology, one may solve for
the phase of the wavefunctional by using a line integral in superspace. Each
contour of integration corresponds to a particular choice of time hypersurface,
and each yields the same answer. In this way, one can construct a covariant
formalism where all time hypersurfaces are treated on an equal footing. Using
the method of characteristics, explicit solutions for an inflationary epoch

Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry such as the distance function and the
relations between topology and curvature. We then define spinor structures in

causality conditions are studied through an analysis of strong causality,
stable causality and global hyperbolicity. In looking at the asymptotic
structure of space-time, we focus on the asymptotic symmetry group of Bondi,
Metzner and Sachs, and the b-boundary construction of Schmidt. The Hamiltonian
structure of space-time is also analyzed, with emphasis on Ashtekar's spinorial
variables. Finally, the question of a rigorous theory of singularities in
space-times with torsion is addressed, describing in detail recent work by the
author. We define geodesics as curves whose tangent vector moves by parallel
transport. This is different from what other authors do, because their
definition of geodesics only involves the Christoffel symbols, though studying
theories with torsion. We then prove how to extend Hawking's singularity
theorem without causality assumptions to the space-time of the ECSK theory.
This is achieved studying the generalized Raychaudhuri equation in the ECSK
theory, the conditions for the existence of conjugate points and properties of
maximal timelike geodesics. Our result can also be interpreted as a
no-singularity theorem if the torsion tensor does not obey some additional
conditions. Thus, it seems that the occurrence of singularities in closed
cosmological models based on the ECSK theory is less generic than in general
relativity. Our work should be compared with important previous papers. There
