expected from the known stars. These experiments measure only one parameter of
the massive compact halo objects (machos), the magnification time scale of the
events. More information is required to understand the nature of the machos. A
satellite experiment has been proposed to measure their projected transverse
speed $\tilde{v} = v/(1-z)$, where $v$ is the macho transverse speed and $z$
its distance divided by the distance of the source. Measurement of $\tilde{v}$
would determine whether the machos were in the Galactic disk, Galactic halo, or
in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We simulate events observed toward the LMC
by the Earth and by a satellite in an Earth like heliocentric orbit. To leading
order, such an experiment determines $\tilde{v}$ up to a two fold degeneracy.
More precise measurements break the degeneracy. We show that with photometric
precisions of 3\% to 4\% and approximately 1 observation per day, $\tilde{v}$
can be measured with a maximum error of 20\% for 70\% to 90\% of events similar
to the ones reported by the EROS and MACHO collaborations. The projected
transverse velocity is known with the same maximum error for 60\% to 75\% of
these events. This 20\% maximum error is not a 1 $\sigma$ error but is mostly
due to degeneracy between two possible solutions, each one being localized to
much better than 20\%. These results are obtained with an Earth-satellite
separation of 1 AU, and are improved by a larger separation.

which the radio power and size of the radio lobe at the forward edge of the

of the bridge in the lateral direction is adiabatic. There is no indication
that reacceleration or energy transport is important in the bridges of these

  of the Cygnus A Workshop, May 1-4, Green Bank, WV",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The radio properties of powerful extended radio sources may be used to
estimate the ambient gas density in the vicinity of radio lobes. A sample of 27
radio lobes from 14 radio galaxies and of 14 radio lobes from 8 radio loud
quasars was constructed using sources from the published literature with
sufficient radio information to allow an estimate of the ambient gas density.
The ambient gas density as a function of separation of the lobe from the center
of the parent galaxy indicates a composite density profile, where Cygnus A
plays the key role of determining the normalization for the ambient gas
density. The composite density profile of the galaxies and quasars studied here
is similar to the density profile of gas in low-redshift clusters of galaxies,
which confirms the result obtained by Daly [1] using a somewhat smaller sample
of radio sources. The data presented here allow an estimate of the core gas
density, core radius, and slope of the density profile assuming that the gas
density can be fit by a King model. The data suggest that the core gas density
decreases as the redshift of the source increases, and is consistent with
either a roughly constant core radius, or a core radius that increases with
increasing source redshift. Thus, our results are completely consistent with
observations indicating negative evolution of the cluster X-ray luminosity
function. (truncated to <24 lines)

$t/t_{free-fall}=0.05\div 0.2$ is the best one for simultaneous detection of
the first two LiH rotational lines. The observational frequency falls between
30 and 250 GHz and the line width ${\Delta \nu\over \nu}$ is between $10^{-5}$

momenta in symmetrical non-linear molecules AB$_2$ is derived within the
framework of small oscillations near the stationary states of a rotating
molecule. The full-dimensional analysis including stretching vibrations has
confirmed the existence of the bifurcation predicted previously by means of the
rigid-bender model. The formation of fourfold energy clusters has already been
experimentally verified for H$_2$Se and it has been demonstrated in
fully-dimensional quantum mechanical calculations using the MORBID computer
program. We show in the present work that apart from the level clustering, the
bifurcation produces physically important effects including molecular
symmetry-breaking and a transition from the normal mode to the local mode limit
for the stretching vibrations due to rovibrational interaction. The application
of the present theory with realistic molecular potentials to the H$_2$Te,
H$_2$Se and H$_2$S hydrides results in predictions of the bifurcation points
very close to those calculated previously. However for the lighter H$_2$O
molecule we find that the bifurcation occurs at higher values of the total
angular momentum than obtained in previous estimations. The present work shows
it to be very unlikely that the bifurcation in H$_2$O will lead to clustering
of energy levels. This result is in agreement with recent variational
calculations.

For larger values of $\sqrt{s}$, the quartic coupling, $\lambda$, becomes
dominant, allowing for a simpler calculation of higher-order corrections. The
high-energy amplitudes display a large logarithmic dependence on $\sqrt{s}$
which can be resummed using renormalization group techniques. The resummation
of leading-log terms is sufficient for Higgs masses of less than 350 GeV. For
350 < $M_H$ < 450 GeV, a next-to-leading-log resummation is necessary. For even
larger values of $M_H$, the perturbative approach fails completely since
two-loop terms become in magnitude larger than one-loop terms. Choosing the
$\overline{{\rm MS}}$ renormalization scheme instead of the OMS scheme, the
coefficients of the perturbative series increase in magnitude, making the
breakdown of perturbation theory even more apparent. In conclusion, the
Standard Model cross sections presented here have very large uncertainties if

application to the reheating problem in inflationary universe models. The
linear regime analysis offers a rationale for the standard approach to the
reheating problem, but we make a distinction between relaxation and
thermalization. We find that particle production when the inflaton starts in
the {\it non-linear} region is typically a far more efficient way of
transfering energy out of the inflaton zero mode and into the quanta of the
lighter scalar than single particle decay. For the non-linear regime we take
into account self-consistently the evolution of the expectation value of the
inflaton field coupled to the evolution of the quantum fluctuations. An
exhaustive numerical analysis reveals that the distribution of produced
particles is far from thermal, and the effect of open channels. In the
fermionic case, Pauli blocking begins to hinder the transfer of energy into the
fermion modes very early on in the evolution of the inflaton. We examine the
implications of our results to the question of how to calculate the reheating
temperature of the universe after inflation.

classical in the Wigner representation. Yet many conceptually important linear
problems are typically analyzed using such generally applicable techniques as
influence functionals and Bogoliubov transformations. In this Letter we point
out that the classical equations of motion provide a simpler and more intuitive
formalism for linear quantum systems. We examine the important problem of
Brownian motion in the independent oscillator model, and show that the quantum
dynamics is described directly and completely by a c-number Langevin equation.
We are also able to apply recent insights into quantum Brownian motion to show
that the classical Fokker-Planck equation is always local in time, regardless
of the spectral density of the environment.
