first study, all models have solar abundances, which is typical of the stars in
the Galactic disk where most of the available data have been collected. A new
feature of these models is the inclusion of rotation in the evolutionary
sequences, thus making it possible to derive theoretically the Rossby number
for each star along its evolutionary track, based on its calculated rotation
rate and its local convective turnover time near the base of the convection
zone. Global turnover times are also calculated for the complete convection

brown dwarfs, stars not quite massive enough to burn hydrogen; we assume a

observations of low mass, low metallicity stars, we obtain much tighter bounds
on low mass stars. We find the halo red dwarf density to be $<1\%$ of the halo,
while our best estimate of this value is 0.14-0.37\%. Thus our estimate of the
halo mass density of red dwarfs drops to 16-40 times less than the reported

a total density of red dwarfs and brown dwarfs of $\sim$0.25-0.67\% of the

the distribution of observed axis ratios of the dust features it is inferred
that 78 \pm 16% of early-type galaxies contain nuclear dust. From the
dependence of the angle between dust major axis and galaxy major axis on size
and appearance of the dust, it is found that dust features with semi-major axis
size a_d > 250 pc are generally not settled. If it is assumed that dust lanes
with a_d < 250 pc are in equilibrium in the galaxy potential, the observed
distribution of misalignment angles can only be explained if elliptical
galaxies have a mean triaxiality <T> >= 0.4. The best fit is obtained for <T> =
0.8, higher than values derived through other methods. This difference cannot
be explained by a dependence of $\langle T \rangle$ on radius. Therefore, it
seems dust is not always completely relaxed, even on the smallest scales.
Furthermore, the rotation axis of the dust does not generally coincide with
that of the stars. This seems to suggest that the dust is acquired from
outside, and has some way of losing its angular momentum efficiently.

of the mechanical energy input from massive stars. Here we evaluate the impact
that winds may have on the structure of giant nebulae and on their supersonic
velocity dispersion. We follow the suggestion from Chu \& Kennicutt (1994) to
see if a combination of a large number of unresolved wind-driven shells caused
by massive stars could produce the integrated broad Gaussian profiles typical
of giant HII regions.
  The results, accounting for a wide range of energies, densities and velocity
or age of the expanding shells, show that supersonic Gaussian profiles may
arise only from a collection of unresolved wind-driven shells if the shells
present a peculiar velocity distribution which implies a strongly peaked age
distribution leading to an awkward star formation history. On the other hand, a
uniform distribution of ages originates profiles with a flat-topped core
defined by the terminal shell velocity and a steep decay as $v^{-6}$ up to the
largest detectable shell speed. Thus, supersonic profiles can arise only if the
final speed of the unresolved shells is supersonic. This implies an equally
supersonic random speed of motions in the ionized gas disrupting the shells
before they slow down to subsonic speeds. It also implies a mechanism,
independent of the shells caused by massive stars, responsible for the
supersonic stirring of the background medium. These facts together with the
conditions for shells to remain unresolved to present day devices (energies,
final speeds and ages), indicate that the winds may be produced by low-mass
stars. In this latter case, if the sources move supersonically in the
gravitational potential of the whole system they could stir the gas, with their

direct effects of the gauging of R-symmetry remain in the low energy effective
Lagrangian, and this result is model independent, requiring only that
R-symmetry be broken at the Planck scale and $<D> = 0$, where $D$ is the
auxiliary field of the $\rm U(1)_R$ vector multiplet. The low energy theory is
fairly conventional with soft SUSY breaking terms for the MSSM fields. As a
remnant of the gauging of R-symmetry, it also contains light fields, some
required to cancel R-anomalies and others from the hidden sector.

This point is illustrated in a leading-order Bianchi-type $VII_0$ string
background, wherein spatial isotropy can be claimed as such a relic. A much
finer one, descending from a premordial gravitational wave, could be retrieved
from its imprint on the small-scale structure of the cosmic microwave
background. In spite of the absence of conventional inflation, there is no
horizon problem thanks to the presence of an equally fundamental mixmaster

The use of polynomial expansions illustrates in a clear and simple way the
ideas of the Source Galerkin method. But at the same time, this choice has
serious limitations. Even after exploiting symmetries, the size of calculations
become prohibitive except for small systems. The calculations in this paper
were made on a workstation of modest power using a fourth order polynomial
expansion for lattices of size $8^2$,$4^3$,$2^4$ in $2D$, $3D$, and $4D$. In

Because it is not based on a statistical technique, it does not have many of
the difficulties often encountered when simulating fermions. Since no
determinant is ever calculated, solutions to problems with dynamical fermions
are handled more easily. This approach is very flexible, and can be taylored to
specific problems based on convenience and computational constraints. We
present simple examples to illustrate the method; more general schemes are
desirable for more complicated systems.
