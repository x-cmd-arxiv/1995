galactic globular clusters, can be used to contrains the age of younger stellar
systems like the nearby dwarfs spheroidal Leo I. We compare the observed
luminosity function of Leo I, presented by Lee et al. 1993, with theoretical
expectations for three selected ages, 1, 1.5 and 2 billion years, deriving an
age of about 1.5 Gyr. This result does not appear critically affected by
assumptions about the cluster distance modulus or the Initial Mass Function.

in M31 disk are studied using the HiRes maps from IRAS. Very thin and bright
FIR arm segments are shown in these maps, which have similar structure as the
HI gas but with much enhanced arm/inter-arm contrast, typically a factor of 5
on the 60$\mu$m image. We identify 39 unconfused sources (excluding the
nucleus) and 14 confused sources (7 pairs) at 60 $\mu$m by direct Gaussian
fittings to the image. IRAS colors of 10 bright isolated sources are studied,
which are presumably representative of the discrete sources in general. The
colors follow the well known anticorrelation between the 60micron/100micron
flux ratio and the 12micron/25micron flux ratio. All sources coincide with
optical HII regions. A comparison with H$\alpha$ observations shows that the
total luminosity (in the wavelength range 8 --- 1000$\mu$m) associated with HII
regions is $7.2\pm 2.9 \; 10^8$L_sun, namely $30\pm 14$\% of the total IR
emission of M31. This luminosity translates into a present-day star formation
rate of 0.36$\pm 0.14$ M_sun/yr, about an order of magnitude lower than that of
the Milky Way Galaxy.

using the HiRes IRAS maps in conjunction with UV, optical (UBV) and the HI
maps. A dust heating/cooling model is developed based on a radiative transfer
model which assumes a `Sandwich' configuration of dust and stars and takes
fully into account the effect of scattering of dust grains. The model is
applied to a complete sample of 'cells' (small areas of size $2'\times 2'$),
generated from the above maps. The sample covers the M31 disk in the
galactocentric radius range 2 --- 14 kpc, and includes only the cells for which
the contribution of the discrete sources to the 60$\mu m$ surface brightness is
negligible ($< 20$\%). This effectively excludes most of the bright arm regions
from our analysis. We find that: (1) The mean optical depth (viewed from the
inclination angle of 77$^\circ$) increases with radius from $\tau_V\sim 0.7$ at
r=2kpc outwards, reaches a peak of ~1.6 near 10kpc, and stays quite flat out to
14kpc, where the signal falls below the 5sigma level. (2) A correlation between
$\tau_V$ and HI surface density is suggested by the similarity between their
radial profiles. Significant differences are found between the radial profiles
of the H_2 gas (estimated from CO) and of the dust (from $\tau_V$), which are
most probably due to the large uncertainty in the CO-to-H_2 conversion factor,
and to the under-representation of H_2-rich regions in the sample of cells of
diffuse regions. (3) The $\tau_V / N(HI)$ ratio decreases with increasing
radius in the disk of M31, with an exponential law fit yielding an e-folding
scale length of $9.6\pm 0.4$ kpc. (4) The optical depth adjusted for this
gradient, $\tau_{V,c}$, is strongly and linearly correlated with N(HI) over one
and a half order of magnitude of column density, indicating that at a given

(LBGK) by analytically solving a simple flow in a 2~-D channel. The flow is
driven by the movement of upper boundary with vertical injection fluid at the
porous boundaries. The velocity profile is shown to satisfy a second-order
finite-difference form of the simplified incompressible Navier-Stokes equation.
With the analysis, different boundary conditions can be studied theoretically.
A momentum exchange principle is also revealed at the boundaries. A general
boundary condition for any given velocity boundary is proposed based on the
analysis.
