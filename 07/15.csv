to the long standing problem of the progenitors for star burst galaxies, which
may be related to a population of small, low surface brightness dwarfs. Larger
low surface brightness spirals are known to evolve slowly, converting little of
their gas mass into stars and metals in a Hubble time. Their slow evolution is
controlled by their low densities, which arise naturally from formation by late
collapse of low amplitude perturbations in the initial density field.

the softness of emission in soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) if they originate in
neutron stars with surface fields above the quantum critical field $B_{\rm
cr}=4.413\times 10^{13}$Gauss. Splitting becomes prolific at such field
strengths: its principal effect is to degrade photon energies, initiating a
cascade that softens gamma-ray spectra. Uniform field cascade calculations have
demonstrated that emission could be softened to the observed SGR energies for
fields exceeding about $10^{14}$Gauss. Recently, we have determined splitting
attenuation lengths and maximum energies for photon escape in neutron star
environments including the effects of magnetospheric dipole field geometry.
Such escape energies $\erg_{esc}$ suitably approximate the peak energy of the
emergent spectrum, and in this paper we present results for $\erg_{esc}$ as a
function of photon emission angles for polar cap and equatorial emission
regions. The escape energy is extremely insensitive to viewing perspective for
equatorial emission, arguing in favour of such a site for the origin of SGR
activity.

due to doppler and gravitational redshifts from the inner parts of a disk about
a massive black hole. Similarly broad lines are evident in shorter observations
of several other active galaxies. In this paper we investigate other line
broadening and skewing mechanisms such as Comptonization in cold gas and
doppler shifts from outflows. We have also fitted complex spectral models to
the data of MCG$-6-30-15$ to see whether the broad skewed line can be mimicked
well by other absorption or emission features. No satisfactory mechanism or
spectral model is found, thus strengthening the relativistic disk line model.

establishes the following. (i) The tail is governed by a cut of the frequency
Green's function $\tilde G(\omega)$ along the $-$~Im~$\omega$ axis,
generalizing the Schwarzschild result. (ii) The $\omega$ dependence of the cut
is determined by the asymptotic but not the local structure of space. In
particular it is independent of the presence of a horizon, and has the same
form for the case of a star as well. (iii) Depending on the spatial
asymptotics, the late time decay is not necessarily a power law in time. The
Schwarzschild case with a power-law tail is exceptional among the class of the
potentials having a logarithmic spatial dependence. (iv) Both the amplitude and
the time dependence of the tail for a broad class of models are obtained
analytically. (v) The analytical results are in perfect agreement with
numerical calculations.

transitions are invoked, the metastable background is assumed to be
sufficiently smooth to justify the use of homogeneous nucleation theory in the
computation of nucleation rates of critical bubbles. In this talk I present the
results of numerical simulations which were designed to quantify
``smoothness''; that is, how the contribution from nonperturbative subcritical
fluctuations may spoil the homogeneity assumption of nucleation theory. I then
show how the numerical results can be understood {\it quantitatively} in terms
of a simple analytical model of subcritical thermal fluctuations. Encouraged by
the success of the model in matching the numerical results, I apply it to the
