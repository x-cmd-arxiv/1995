Universe have shown that accretion shocks form during the gravitational
collapse of one-dimensional caustics, and that clusters of galaxies formed at
intersections of the caustics are surrounded by these accretion shocks.
Estimated speed and curvature radius of the shocks are 1000-3000 \kms and about
5 Mpc, respectively, in the $\Omega=1$ CDM universe. Assuming that energetic
protons are accelerated by these accretion shocks via the first-order Fermi
process and modeling particle transport around the shocks through Bohm
diffusion, we suggest that protons can be accelerated up to the {\it Greisen
cutoff energy} near $6\times 10^{19}$ eV, provided the mean magnetic field
strength in the region around the shocks is at least of order a microgauss. We
have also estimated the proton flux at earth from the Virgo cluster. Assuming a
few (1-10) \% of the ram pressure of the infalling matter would be transferred
to the cosmic-rays, the estimated flux for $ E \sim 10^{19}$eV is consistent
with observations, so that such clusters could be plausible sources of the UHE
CRs.

discovery in the sixties. The BATSE detector on COMPTON-GRO satellite has been
detecting GRBs for the last four years at a rate of one burst per day. Its
findings has revolutionized our ideas about the nature of these objects. In
this lecture I show that the simplest, most conventional and practically
inevitable, interpretation of the observations is that GRBs form during the
conversion of the kinetic energy of ultra-relativistic particles to radiation.
The inner ``engine"" that accelerates these particles is well hidden from direct
observations and its origin might remain mysterious for a long time.

one-dimensional subbands to edge states and to Landau levels can be followed by
optical experiments by choosing the appropriate, linear or circular,
polarization of the light, yielding information on the one-dimensional

collisions requires a consideration of the effects of the deformation of the
projectile and target. Our aim here is to show that deformation and orientation
of the colliding nuclei have a very significant effect on the fusion-barrier
height and on the compactness of the touching configuration. To facilitate
discussions of fusion configurations of deformed nuclei, we develop a
classification scheme and introduce a notation convention for these
configurations. We discuss particular deformations and orientations that lead
to compact touching configurations and to fusion-barrier heights that
correspond to fairly low excitation energies of the compound systems. Such
configurations should be the most favorable for producing superheavy elements.
We analyse a few projectile-target combinations whose deformations allow
favorable entrance-channel configurations and whose proton and neutron numbers
lead to compound systems in a part of the superheavy region where alpha
half-lives are calculated to be observable, that is, longer than 1 microsecond.

states. We use the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with long-range Coulomb
interactions. The Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation and the single-excitation
configuration- interaction (single-CI) method are used to obtain optical
absorption spectra. The third-harmonic generation (THG) at off-resonant
frequencies is calculated as functions of the soliton concentration and the
chain length of the polymer. The magnitude of the THG at the 10 percent doping
increases by the factor about 10^2 from that of the neutral system. This is
owing to the accumulation of the oscillator strengths at the lowest exciton
with increasing the soliton concentration. The increase by the order two is
common for several choices of Coulomb interaction strengths.
