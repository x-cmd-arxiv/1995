connected compact real-analytic manifold into a sphere or into a hyperbolic
space. The dual variety is defined to be the set of all normal directions of
the immersion. First, we show that the image of the Gauss map characterizes the
manifold. Also we show that the dual variety characterizes the manifold.
Besides, duality of the second fundamental form and some results on
degeneration are obtained. In Algebraic Geometry E-prints eight files are

find unstable periodic and non-periodic orbits in a chaotic system. The method
is simple and efficient and has been successfully applied to a number of
different systems such as the H\'enon map, disk billiards, stadium billiard,
wedge billiard, diamagnetic Kepler problem, colinear Helium atom and systems
with attracting potentials. The method seems to be better than earlier applied
methods.

the presence of random magnetic field. In the weak-disorder region, by
perturbative analytical techniques, we derive scaling laws for the localization
length, ${\xi}$, of the form $ \xi \propto \frac{1}{w^{\eta}}$, where $w$ is
the size of magnetic disorder and the exponent $\eta$ assumes different values
in the various energy ranges. Moreover, in the neighborhood of the energies
where a new channel opens a certain rearrangement of the perturbation expansion
leads to scaling functions for $\xi$. Although the latter are in general
quantitatively wrong, they correctly reproduce the corresponding $\eta$
exponents and the form of the scaling variables and are therefore useful for
understanding the behavior of $\xi$.

  ``Electroweak Interactions and Unified Theories""",,,"MIT-CTP-2452","hep-ph",,"  Flat directions are a generic feature of supersymmetric theories. They are of
cosmological interest because they can lead to coherent production of scalars.
In the early universe such flat directions could be dangerous due to the
potentially large energy density and the late decay of the associated scalars
when they have only $1/M_p$ couplings (Polonyi problem). On the other hand,
flat directions among the standard model fields can carry baryon number and
lead to a possible mechanism for baryogenesis (Affleck Dine baryogenesis). When
considering the cosmological consequences of the flat directions, it is
important to take into account the soft potential with curvature of order the
Hubble constant due to supersymmetry breaking in the early universe. In this
talk, we discuss flat directions, their potential cosmological implications
focusing on Affleck-Dine baryogenesis, and how the standard picture of their
evolution must be modified in the presence of the large supersymmetry breaking
in the early universe.

$s \to d\gamma$ transition using the Vector Meson Dominance approximation
$(V=\rho,\omega,\psi_i)$. We find that this contribution may be significantly
larger than the short distance (SD) contribution to $s \to d\gamma$ and could
possibly saturate the present experimental upper bound on the $\Omega^-\to
\Xi^-\gamma$ decay rate, $\Gamma^{\rm MAX}_{\Omega^-\to \Xi^-\gamma} \simeq
3.7\times10^{-9}$eV. For the decay $B_s \to B^*_d\gamma$, which is driven by $s
\to d\gamma$ as well, we obtain an upper bound on the branching ratio $BR(B_s
\to B_d^*\gamma)<3\times10^{-8}$ from $\Gamma^{\rm MAX}_{\Omega^-\to
\Xi^-\gamma}$. Barring the possibility that the Quantum Chromodynamics
coefficient $a_2(m_s)$ be much smaller than 1, $\Gamma^{\rm MAX}_{\Omega^-\to
\Xi^-\gamma}$ also implies the approximate relation $\frac{2}{3} \sum_i
\frac{g^2_{\psi_i}(0)}{m^2_{\psi_i}} \simeq \frac{1}{2}
\frac{g^2_\rho(0)}{m^2_\rho} + \frac{1}{6}\frac{g^2_\omega(0)}{m^2_\omega}$.
This relation agrees quantitatively with a recent independent estimate of the
l.h.s. by Deshpande et al., confirming that the LD contributions to $b \to
s\gamma$ are small. We find that these amount to an increase of $(4\pm2)\%$ in
the magnitude of the $b \to s \gamma$ transition amplitude, relative to the SD
contribution alone.

cross section for the `see-saw' models is negligible because they predict in a
natural way very small electron-heavy neutrino mixing angles. However, there
exist other models, in which the electron-heavy neutrino mixing angles are free
parameters and can be large. Taking into account the present experimental
bounds on mixing angles the large cross section for the e-e- -> W-W- is still
acceptable.
