taking advantage of the correlation of the emission in neighboring pixels. The
optimal multi-frequency subtraction method improves on simple pixel-by-pixel

fact that most contaminants have angular power spectra that differ
substantially from that of the CMB. The results are natural to visualize in the

present a brief overview of the geography of this plane, showing the regions

criteria match as closely as possible those of samples of nearby galaxies. The

look-back time of half the present age of the Universe for Omega ~ 1. Such a
survey can then be used for studying many different aspects of the evolution of
galaxies over the interval 0 < z < 1. In this paper we describe the selection
of the fields, the multicolor imaging observations and the construction and
validation of the photometric catalogs. Particular attention is paid to
quantifying the unavoidable selection effects in surface brightness and their
impact on the survey is assessed in the context of the properties of known
populations of galaxies. The photometric catalogs contain several thousand
objects brighter than I_{AB}< 22.5 and are essentially complete for central
surface brightnesses as faint as $\mu_{AB}(I)$ $\sim$ 24.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$.
This should be sufficient to include both normal surface brightness galaxies

The full data set consists of more than one thousand spectra, of objects with
17.5 < I_{AB} < 22.5, obtained from deep multi-slit data with the MARLIN and
MOS-SIS spectrographs at the CFHT. The final spectroscopic catalog contains 200
stars, 591 galaxies with secure redshifts in the range 0 < z < 1.3, 6 QSOs, and
146 objects with very uncertain or unknown redshifts, leading to an overall
success rate of identification of 85%. Additionally, 67 objects affected by
observational problems have been placed in a supplemental list.
  We describe here the instrumental set up, and the observing procedures used
to efficiently gather this large data set. New optimal ways of packing spectra
on the detector to significantly increase the multiplexing gain offered by
multi-slit spectroscopy are described. Dedicated data reduction procedures have
been developed under the IRAF environment to allow for fast and accurate
processing.
  Very strict procedures have been followed to establish a reliable list of
final spectroscopic measurements. Fully independent processing of the data has
been carried out by three members of the team for each data set associated with
a multi-slit mask, and final redshifts were
  assigned only after the careful comparison of the three independent
measurements. A confidence class scheme was established. We strongly emphasize
the benefits of such procedures.

is independent of possible biases arising from surface brightness effects

the mask designs for our spectroscopic observations also do not produce any
significant bias. There is however a bias at the highest and lowest redshifts,
especially for absorption-line galaxies at z > 1 and z < 0.2, due to the
adopted spectral range (4250A to 8500A). Apart from the latter, we conclude
that our sample of identified galaxies is an unbiased subsample of the original

85%. The redshift histogram of the sample is presented for 591 field galaxies
with secure redshifts. The median redshift is z = 0.56, and the highest
redshift observed is z = 1.3; 25 galaxies have z > 1 The distributions of
magnitudes and colors demonstrate that galaxies at these high redshifts have
very similar colors to those observed locally. The survey thus represents a
major improvement in our knowledge of field galaxies at large look-back times.
Only ~1% of the galaxies are as compact as stars (on images with FWHM ~ 0.9"")
and comparisons of the photometric and spectroscopic data show that only one
galaxy was initially incorrectly classified spectroscopically as a star, and
only two stars were misclassified as galaxies. It is demonstrated that the
redshift distributions in the five fields are statistically consistent with
each other, once the reduction in the effective number of independent galaxies
due to small-scale clustering in redshift is taken into account.
  The photometric properties of the spectroscopically-unidentified objects
indicate that most are likely to be galaxies rather than stars. At least half
of these must have the same redshift distribution as the identified galaxies,
and a combination of magnitudes, colors and compactness of the remaining
unidentified galaxies is used to predict their redshifts. The majority are
probably ordinary galaxies at the high redshift end of our sample, including
some quiescent galaxies at z > 1.0, rather than some new or unusual population.

conserving approximation and has led to useful insights into strongly
correlated models of magnetic impurities. At low energies and temperatures the
method is known to be inaccurate for dynamical properties due to the appearance
of singularities in the physical Green's functions. The problems in developing
alternative reliable theories for dynamical properties have made it difficult
to quantify these inaccuracies. As a first step in obtaining a theory which is
valid also in the low energy regime, we identify the origin of the problems
within the NCA. We show, by comparison with close to exact NRG calculations for
the auxiliary and physical particle spectral functions, that the main source of
error in the NCA is in the lack of vertex corrections in the convolution
formulae for physical Green's functions. We show that the dynamics of the
auxiliary particles within NCA is essentially correct for a large parameter
region, including the physically interesting Kondo regime, for all energy
scales down to $T_{0}$, the low energy scale of the model, and often well below
this scale. Despite the satisfactory description of the auxiliary particle
dynamics, the physical spectral functions are not obtained accurately on scales
$\sim T_{0}$. Our results suggest that self--consistent conserving
approximations which include vertex terms may provide a highly accurate way of
dealing with strongly correlated systems at low temperatures.

closer look at the construction of the N=2 superconformal algebra will show
that the embedding is not essential, and this will tell us how to generalise

there is a cardinal preserving generic extension V_1 of V satisfying GCH and
having the same reals as V does , so that adding kappa many Cohen reals over
