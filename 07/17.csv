increasing the understanding of these enigmatic sources. A diversity of ideas
and analyses has been generated over the last two decades to explain line
features and continuum shapes, encompassing both older galactic neutron star
and ``new age'' cosmological source models. This paper reviews some of the
highlights of these studies, discussing the merits and limitations of various
ideas, and in particular their compatibility with the observational data. The
first focus will be on continuum models for GRBs, which include optically thin
synchrotron emission and resonant Compton upscattering near galactic neutron
stars, while the synchrotron and non-magnetic inverse Compton scattering
mechanisms are prominent in the less well-developed cosmological scenarios.
Line formation scenarios will then be discussed, in particular the scattering
model for producing cyclotron features, which remains the only viable
explanation for the Ginga observations of double lines. Absorption-like line
production in cosmological burst models is generally difficult, though
interesting notions such as femtolensing interference patterns have been
proffered.

a large enhancement of the drag rate due to the presence of coupled plasmon

as a function of temperature at $T \approx 0.5 T_F$, and (ii) as a function of
the ratio of densities of the carriers in the two layers when their Fermi

theory is developed for totally constrained systems, that is, canonical systems
in which the hamiltonian is written as a linear combination of constraints
$h_\alpha$ with arbitrary coefficients. The main purpose of the present paper
is to make clear that classical dynamics of a totally constrained system is
nothing but the foliation of the constraint submanifold in phase space by the
involutive system of infinitesimal canonical transformations $Y_\alpha$
generated by the constraint functions. From this point of view it is shown that
statistical dynamics for an ensemble of a totally constrained system can be
formulated in terms of a relative distribution function without gauge fixing or
reduction. There the key role is played by the fact that the canonical measure
in phase space and the vector fields $Y_\alpha$ induce natural conservative
measures on acausal submanifolds, which are submanifolds transversal to the
dynamical foliation. Further it is shown that the structure coefficients
$c^\gamma_{\alpha\beta}$ defined by $\{h_\alpha,h_\beta\}=\sum_\gamma
c^\gamma_{\alpha\beta}h_\gamma$ should weakly commute with $h_\alpha$,
$\sum_\gamma\{h_\gamma,c^\gamma_{\alpha\beta}\}\approx0$, in order that the
description in terms of the relative distribution function is consistent. The
overall picture on the classical dynamics given in this paper provides the
basic motivation for the quantum formulation developed in the subsequent
papers.

systems is developed, in which physical quantities representing time are
included as observables. In this formulation the hamiltonian constraints are
imposed on a relative probability amplitude functional $\Psi$ which determines
the relative probability for each state to be observed, instead of on the state
vectors as in the conventional Dirac quantization. This leads to a foliation of
the state space by linear manifolds on each of which $\Psi$ is constant, and
dynamics is described as linear mappings among acausal subspaces which are
transversal to these linear manifolds. This is a quantum analogue of the
classical statistical dynamics of totally constrained systems developed in the
previous paper. It is shown that if the von Neumann algebra $\C$ generated by
the constant of motion is of type I, $\Psi$ can be consistently normalizable on
the acausal subspaces on which a factor subalgebra of $\C$ is represented
irreducibly, and the mappings among these acausal subspaces are conformal. How
the formulation works is illustrated by simple totally constrained systems with
a single constraint such as the parametrized quantum mechanics, a relativistic
free particle in Minkowski and curved spacetimes, and a simple minisuperspace
model. It is pointed out that the inner product of the relative probability
amplitudes induced from the original Hilbert space picks up a special
decomposition of the wave functions to the positive and the negative frequency
modes.

generates a large isospin-violating correction---proportional to the

isospin-conserving case, this correction is not cancelled by $\sigma$-meson

  4th Colloquium ""Quantum Groups and Integrable Systems"" (Prague, June 1995)",,"10.1007/BF01688822",,"q-alg math.QA",,"  We report some observations concerning two well-known approaches to
construction of quantum groups. Thus, starting from a bialgebra of
inhomogeneous type and imposing quadratic, cubic or quartic commutation
relations on a subset of its generators we come, in each case, to a q-deformed
universal enveloping algebra of a certain simple Lie algebra. An interesting
correlation between the order of initial commutation relations and the Cartan
matrix of the resulting algebra is observed. Another example demonstrates that
the bialgebra structure of sl_q(2) can be completely determined by requiring
the q-oscillator algebra to be its covariant comodule, in analogy with Manin's
approach to define SL_q(2) as a symmetry algebra of the bosonic and fermionic
quantum planes.

fast for positive coupling constants. They do not, however, possess the correct
left-hand cut in the complex coupling constant plane, implying a wrong
large-order behavior of their Taylor expansion coefficients. We correct this
deficiency and present a method of resumming divergent series with their proper
large-order behavior. For a given set of expansion coefficients, knowledge of
the large-order behavior considerably improves the quality of the
approximation.
