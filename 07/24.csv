coincident with the timing position of PSR J2145-0750. While a galaxy or

with an ancient white dwarf, as expected from evolutionary models. For PSR
J0034-0534 no objects were detected to a limiting magnitude of R=25.0,
suggesting that the white dwarf in this system is cold. Using white dwarf
cooling models, the limit on the magnitude of the PSR J0034-0534 companion
suggests that at birth the pulsar in this system may have rotated with a period
as short as 0.6 ms. These observations provide further evidence that the
magnetic fields of millisecond pulsars do not decay on time scales shorter than

defined a single abundance indicator which is able to provide useful iron

observational data is described in Jones, Wyse and Gilmore (PASP July 1995).
The technique provides precise iron abundances, with zero-point correct to

with the Position Sensitive Proportional Counter aboard the ROSAT Observatory
in a 32 ks pointed observation of Hickson's Compact Group (HCG) #94. Besides
HCG94, A2572, a richness class 0 Abell cluster, is also contained in the
central region of the field of view.
  Both systems are at a redshift of z~0.04 and are falling toward each other at
a velocity of about 1000 km/s. Their three-dimensional spatial separation is
probably of the order of an Abell radius; however, as yet, no clear signs of
dynamical interaction are discernible in the X-ray.
  We find HCG94's gas temperature and unabsorbed X-ray luminosity to be far too
high for a galaxy group thereby confirming the claim of Ebeling, Voges &
B""ohringer (1994) that HCG94 should be classified as a galaxy cluster. The
opposite is true for the Abell cluster A2572, the optical richness of which has
been overestimated due to the inclusion of HCG94. In the X-ray, A2572 appears
at first sight like the prototypical binary cluster with two equally massive
and X-ray bright subclusters in the process of merging. However, the available
X-ray, optical, and radio data strongly suggest that A2572 proper is in fact
merely a loose group of galaxies, while the second component is a much richer
and more distant cluster seen in superposition.
  A deprojection analysis shows HCG94 to host a moderate cooling flow; this
picture is supported by a radial increase in the column density of absorbing
material and a decrease in the gas temperature toward the cluster centre.
HCG94's total gravitating mass is much higher than what could be anticipated
from its appearance in the optical. Our findings hence underline the need for

of large voids require more power on the scale of $\approx 1500$\kms than is
generally accepted in CDM models. For a generic power law primordial spectrum
$P(k) \propto k^n$ gravitational growth of voids requires $n \gsim 1.25$, which
is marginally compatible with the observed CMBR fluctuations. If future
measurements will show that the amplitude of fluctuations required to produce
the voids is too large they will imply that the voids did not grow
gravitationally and that galaxies do not trace matter on very large scale.

noun phrase relation (a noun-noun relation). Specifically, we view this problem
as an on-line learning problem in the sense of Littlestone's learning model in
which the learner's goal is to minimize the total number of prediction
mistakes. In the computational learning theory literature, Goldman, Rivest and
Schapire and subsequently Goldman and Warmuth have considered the on-line
learning problem for binary relations R : X * Y -> {0, 1} in which one of the
domain sets X can be partitioned into a relatively small number of types,
namely clusters consisting of behaviorally indistinguishable members of X. In
this paper, we extend this model and suppose that both of the sets X, Y can be
partitioned into a small number of types, and propose a host of prediction
algorithms which are two-dimensional extensions of Goldman and Warmuth's
weighted majority type algorithm proposed for the original model. We apply
these algorithms to the learning problem for the `compound noun phrase'
relation, in which a noun is related to another just in case they can form a
noun phrase together. Our experimental results show that all of our algorithms
out-perform Goldman and Warmuth's algorithm. We also theoretically analyze the
performance of one of our algorithms, in the form of an upper bound on the
worst case number of prediction mistakes it makes.

$\tau(D^+)/\tau(D^0)$ and $\tau(D_s^+)/\tau(D^0)$ are now known with an
accuracy of 1.7\% and 3.7\% respectively. In the baryon sector the statistics
is still limited, but the experimental results on $\Lambda_c^+$, $\Xi_c^0$ and
$\Xi_c^+$ exhibit a clear pattern of lifetime hierarchy, as expected from
simple theoretical arguments. The first measurement of $\tau(\Omega_c^0)$ from
E687 is also presented to complete the charmed baryon lifetime picture. The
more accurate experimental scenario can provide information on non-perturbative
QCD effects and the hadronic matrix elements.

the oscillation occurs only between two neutrino states: switching on the
oscillation into third neutrino increases the $\chi^2$ value. Namely, we
consider the vacuum oscillation scenario in the three-neutrino system (4
parameters) and find out that the $\chi^2$ minimum is always achieved in the
{\it two} parameter subspace in which actually only {\it two} neutrino states
oscillate. This holds in the framework of any solar model with relaxed

uncountable graphs. A monotone class of graphs is defined by forbidding
countable subgraphs, related to the graph's end-structure. Using a
combinatorial theorem of Shelah it is proved:
  - The complexity of the class in every regular uncountable $\l>\aleph_1$ is
at least $\lambda^+ + \sup\{\mu^{\aleph_0}:\mu^+<\lambda\}$
  - For all regular uncountable $\lambda>\aleph_1$ there are $2^\lambda$
pairwise non embeddable graphs in the class having strong homogeneity
properties.
  - It is characterized when some invariants of a graph $G\in \Cal G_\lambda$
have to be inherited by one of fewer than $\lambda$ subgraphs whose union
covers $G$.
  All three results are obtained as corollaries of a representation theorem
that asserts the existence of a surjective homomorphism from the relation of
embeddability over isomorphism types of regular cardinality $\lambda>\aleph_1$
onto set inclusion over all subsets of reals or cardinality $\lambda$ or less.
Continuity properties of the homomorphism are used to extend the first result
to all singular cardinals below the first cardinal fixed point of second order.
  The first result shows that, unlike what Shelah showed in the class of all
graphs, the relations of embeddability in this class is not independent of
negations of the GCH.
