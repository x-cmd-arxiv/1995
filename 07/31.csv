detection of singly ionized helium in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) at
$z \simeq 3.3$. We consider a model in which neutrinos predominantly decay into
invisible relativistic particles with a rate $\tau^{-1}$, and with a small
branching ratio into the radiative mode. To satisfy the observation of singly
ionized helium, which puts a lower bound on the number density of singly
ionized helium in the IGM, we show that: for $\tau \ga 10^{18} \,{\rm sec}(1
\,{\rm eV}/m_\nu^2)$, transition moment of neutrinos $\mu_{12}$ is constrained
to be $\le 4 \hbox{--}8 \times 10^{-17} \,\mu_{\sc B}$ for $ 110 \,{\rm eV} \la

occupation numbers in the current practical applications of the density
functional formalism. In these calculations one has to decide how to distribute
a given, fixed number of electrons over a set of single-particle orbitals. The
conventional choice is to have orbitals below the Fermi level completely
occupied and the orbitals above the Fermi level empty. Although there is a
certain confusion in literature why this choice is superior to any others, the
general belief is that it can justified by treating the occupation numbers as
variational parameters and then applying Janak's theorem or similar reasoning.
We demonstrate that there is a serious flaw in those arguments,mainly the
kinetic energy and therefore the exchange-correlation potential are not
differentiable with respect to density for arbitrary occupation numbers. It is
rigorously shown that in the present context of the density functional
calculations there is no freedom to vary the occupation numbers. The occupation
numbers cannot be considered as variational parameters.

direction of the supersymmetric extension of the standard model (Affleck-Dine
mechanism) is investigated. Two important effects are emphasized. First,
nonrenormalizable terms in the superpotential can lift standard model flat
directions at large field values. Second, the finite energy density in the
early universe induces soft potentials with curvature of order the Hubble
constant. Both these have important implications for baryogenesis, which
requires large squark or slepton expectation values to develop along flat
directions. In particular, the induced mass squared must be negative. The
resulting baryon to entropy ratio is very insensitive to the details of the
couplings and initial conditions, but depends on the dimension of the
nonrenormalizable operator in the superpotential which stabilizes the flat
direction and the reheat temperature after inflation. Unlike the original
scenario, an acceptable baryon asymmetry can result without subsequent entropy
releases. In the simplest scenario the baryon asymmetry is generated along the
$LH_u$ flat direction, and is related to the mass of the lightest neutrino.

stable under radiative corrections induced by the standard Higgs fields.
Moreover, g_ab = 0 to all orders seems to require an exact symmetry. The
spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry induces further mixing between the
two gauge bosons and introduces a fourth independent physical parameter. A
consequence of our analysis is that the usual tree-level description with only

angle) is not in general a justified zero order limit of the treatment

examples designed to illustrate facets of the formalism. We then calculate the
embedded defect spectrum for three physical Grand Unified Theories and conclude
with a discussion of vortices formed in the superfluid $^3$He-A phase

solutions of four-dimensional effective N=4 supersymmetric superstring vacua,
which become massless at special points of moduli space, is studied in terms of
the fields of the effective heterotic string theory compactified on a
six-torus. Those are singular four-dimensional solutions corresponding to
$O(6,22,Z)$ orbits of dyonic configurations (with zero axion), whose
left-moving as well as right-moving electric and magnetic charges are
orthogonal (light-like in the $O(6,22,Z)$ sense), while the $O(6,22,Z)$ norms
of both the electric and magnetic charges are negative. Purely electric [or
purely magnetic] and dyonic configurations preserve $1\over 2$ and $1\over 4$
of N=4 supersymmetry, respectively, thus belonging to the vector and the
highest spin $3\over 2$ supermultiplets, respectively. Purely electric [or
purely magnetic] solutions (along with an infinite tower of $SL(2,Z)$
transformed states) become massless at a point of the corresponding
``one-torus'', thus may contribute to the enhancement of non-Abelian gauge
symmetry, while dyonic solutions become simultaneously massless at a point of
the corresponding two-torus, and thus may in addition contribute to the
enhancement of the local supersymmetry there.
