sites of intense galaxy interaction, while their small populations make them
relatively simple to analyze. In order to search for optical interaction
tracers such as diffuse light and galaxy tidal features in Hickson compact
groups (HCGs), we carried out deep photometry in three filters on a sample of
HCGs with $ROSAT$ observations. Using a modeling procedure to subtract the
light of bright early-type galaxies, we found shell systems and extended
envelopes around many, but not all, of those galaxies. Only one group in our
sample, HCG 94, has diffuse light in the group potential (with a luminosity of
7 L$^*$); the other groups do not contain more than 1/3 L$^*$ in diffuse light.
With the exception of HCG 94 (which is the most X-ray--luminous HCG), we found
no correlation between the presence of shells or other tidal features and the
X-ray luminosity of a group. Better predictors of detectable group X-ray
emission are a low spiral fraction and belonging to a larger galaxy
condensation---neither of which are correlated with optical disturbances in the
group galaxies. Two elliptical galaxies that are extremely optically luminous
but X-ray--faint are found to have shells and very complex color structures.
This is likely due to recent infall of gas-rich material into the galaxies,
which would produce both the disruption of stellar orbits and a significant
amount of star formation.

a mass-metallicity relation. Spectroscopic gradients arise mainly from a radial
decrease in mean stellar metallicity. However, the Mg$_2$ and $<{\rm Fe}>$

possible to predict the low energy gauge couplings and masses of the
3.generation particles from a few parameters at the GUT scale, and electroweak
symmetry breaking. Further constraints can be derived from the branching ratio
for the radiative (penguin) decay of the b-quark into s gamma and the lower
limit on the lifetime of the universe, which requires the dark matter density
due to the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) not to overclose the
universe. From a chi^2 analysis, in which these constraints can be considered
simultaneously, one can calculate the probability for each point in the MSGUT
parameter space. The recently measured top quark mass prefers two solutions for
the mixing angle in the Higgs sector: tan beta in the range between 1 and 3 or
alternatively tan beta approx 25-50. For both cases we find a unique chi^2
minimum in the parameter space. For the low tan beta solution these additional
constraints can be fulfilled simultaneously for quite a large region of the
parameter space. In contrast, for the high tan beta solution the correct value
for the b --> s gamma rate is obtained only for small values of the gaugino
scale. For particles, which are most likely to have masses in the LEP II energy
range, the cross sections are given for the various energy scenarios at LEP II.
The highest LEP II energies (205 GeV) are just high enough to cover a large
region of the preferred parameter space, both for the low and high tan beta
solutions. For low tan beta the production of the lightest Higgs boson, which
is expected to have a mass below 115 GeV, is the most promising channel, while
for large tan beta the production of charginos and/or neutralinos covers the
preferred parameter space.

relativity can be made compatible with quantum mechanics by using the field
equations of general relativity to construct a Robertson-Walker metric for a
quantum particle so that the line element of the particle can be transformed
entirely to that of the Minkowski spacetime, which is assumed by a quantum
observer, and the spacetime dynamics of the particle described by a Minkowski
observer takes the form of quantum mechanics. Spacetime structure of a quantum
particle may have either positive or negative curvature. However, in order to
be describable using the familiar framework of quantum mechanics, the spacetime
structure of a quantum particle must be ""quantised"" by an introduction of the
imaginary number $i$. If a particle has a positive curvature then the
quantisation is equivalent to turning the pseudo-Riemannian spacetime of the
particle into a Riemannian spacetime. This means that it is assumed the
particle is capable of measuring its temporal distance like its spatial
distances. On the other hand, when a particle has a negative curvature and a
negative energy density then quantising the spacetime structure of the particle
is equivalent to viewing the particle as if it had a positive curvature and a
positive energy density.

second order in the inverse nucleon mass. It is found that the interaction
Hamiltonian appearing in the nonrelativistic amplitude has significant
dependence, starting at second order, on the vector and scalar mean nuclear
potentials. These strong medium modifications are absent in traditional
nonrelativistic calculations. Detailed comparisons show that these
modifications are crucial to understanding the differences between relativistic
and nonrelativistic models. These differences are also examined through
reduction of the relativistic amplitude via the Foldy-Wouthuysen
transformation. Similar medium modifications are obtained in this case as well.
We discuss the implications of these medium modifications for the consistency
of existing nonrelativistic calculations.

to accurately model the magnitude and distribution of line radiation in this

radiation transport using CRETIN, a multi-dimensional, non-local thermodynamic

transport processes necessary to model the complex environment of a radiative
divertor. We also include neutral transport to model radiation from recycling
neutral atoms. This paper presents a case study of a high-recycling radiative
divertor with a typical large neutral pressure at the divertor plate to
estimate the impact of H line radiation on the overall power balance in the
