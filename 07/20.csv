redshift interval 0 <= z <= 0.5 in cosmological models with a mixture of cold
and hot dark matter (CHDM). Four different techniques are utilized: the
cluster-cluster correlation function, axial ratios and quadrupoles of the dark
matter distribution in individual clusters, and virial properties. We find that
the correlation function for clusters of the same mass limit was larger and
steeper at high redshifts. The slope increases from 1.8 at z=0 to 2.1 at z=0.5.
Comoving correlation length r_c scales with the mass limit M within comoving
radius 1.5 h^-1 Mpc and the redshift z as r_c ~= 20(1+z)(M/M_*)^1/3, where M_*
= 3*10^14 h^-1 M_sun. When the correlation length is normalized to the mean
cluster separation d_c, it remains almost constant: r_c~=(0.45-0.5) d_c. For
small masses (M_clust <2*10^14 h^-1 M_sun) there is an indication that r_c goes
slightly above the relation with the constant of proportionality being ~=
0.55-0.6. Anisotropy of density distribution in a cluster shows no change over
redshift with axial ratios remaining constant around 1.2. In other words,
clusters at present are as elongated as they were at the epoch of their first
appearance. While the anisotropy of clusters does not change with time, the
density profile shows visible evolution: the slope of density profile changes
from gamma ~= -3.5 at z=0.5 to gamma ~= -2.5 at the present. We find that the
core of a cluster remains essentially the same over time, but the density of
the outlying regions increases noticeably. The virial relation M ~ v^2 is a
good approximation, but there is a large fraction of clusters with peculiar
velocities greater than given by this relation, and clusters with the same rms
velocities have smaller masses in the past, a factor of 2 at z=0.5.

foreground mass condensations directly responsible for the gravitational
magnification of four distant luminous radiosources and one optical QSO. The
technique uses a weak lensing analysis of the distant galaxies in the field of
each source. We find a coherent shear map with a large magnification bias on
the line of sight to Q1622+0328. The local shear in the field of the bright
radiosources is also often correlated with nearby groups or poor clusters of
galaxies. For three of them, the groups are identified as gravitational
deflectors that magnify the radiosources. This suggests that a substantial
amount of invisible mass is condensed in groups and poor clusters It may
explain the origin of a large angular correlation between the distribution of
distant radiosources and the distribution of low redshift galaxies. We discuss
the feasability and consequences of a future systematic survey to investigate
the problem of magnification bias in the fields of luminous distant objects and
to probe the mass distributions of galaxy groups at intermediate redshifts.

amplitudes, a representation which is useful to relate string theory and field
theory, one has to prove first that each $\alpha$- parameter (where $\alpha$ is
the parameter associated to each propagator in the $\alpha$-representation of
the Feynman amplitudes) can be replaced by a constant instead of being
integrated over and second, prove that this constant can be taken equal for all
propagators of a given graph. The first proposition has been proven in one
recent letter when the number of propagators is infinite. Here we prove the
second one. In order to achieve this, we demonstrate that the sum over the
weighted spanning trees of a Feynman graph $G$ can be factorized for disjoint
parts of $G$. The same can also be done for cuts on $G$, resulting in a
rigorous derivation of the Gaussian representation for super-renormalizable
scalar field theories. As a by-product spanning trees on Feynman graphs can be
used to define a discretized functional space.

used to describe a nonabelian gauge theory. Predictions are made for certain
alternatives, with particular attention given to coarse-grainings involving the
constraint. In this way, the theory is compared to other quantum-mechanical
descriptions of gauge theories in which the constraints are imposed by hand.
The vanishing of the momentum space constraint is seen to hold, both through a
simple formal argument and via a more careful description of the Lorentzian
path integral as defined on a spacetime lattice. (Incidentally, the treatment
of the time slicing in the path integral may be of general technical interest.)
The configuration space realization of the constraint is shown to behave in a
more complicated fashion. For some coarse grainings, we recover the known
result from an abelian theory, that coarse grainings by values of the
constraint either predict its vanishing or fail to decohere. However, sets of
alternatives defined in terms of a more complicated quantity in the abelian
case are exhibited where definite predictions can be made which disagree with
the assumption that the constraints vanish. Finally, the configuration space
sum-over-histories theory is exhibited in a manifestly Lorentz-invariant
formulation.
