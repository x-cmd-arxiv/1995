various widths and heights in a Cold Dark Matter cosmology. We use a
one-dimensional spherical Lagrangian hydrodynamics code to follow the
dynamical, thermal, and non-equilibrium chemical evolution of the gas. The
system includes a collisionless dark matter component and a baryonic component
composed of the nine species H, H^-, H^+, He, He^+, He^{++}, H_2, H_2^+, and
e^-. All relevant chemical reactions between these species and their cooling
mechanisms are included in the calculations. We find that radiative cooling by
H_2 affects the collapse dynamics of the gas only after it has already
virialized and become part of the bound object. Therefore, radiative cooling is
unlikely to have triggered the initial collapse of perturbations at redshifts
z>10. Nevertheless, objects with baryonic masses well below the linear-theory
Jeans mass (<10^3 solar masses) collapse due to shell crossing by the dark
matter. Such objects could be the progenitors of a primordial population of
high-mass stars in the intergalactic medium.

if surface gravity is non-zero constant throughout the horizon one can {\it
globally} extend such a spacetime so that the image of $\cal N$ is a proper
subset of a regular bifurcate Killing horizon in the enlarged spacetime. The
necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the extendibility of matter
fields to the enlarged spacetime. These conditions are automatically satisfied
if the spacetime is static (and, hence ``$t$""-reflection symmetric) or
stationary-axisymmetric with ``$t-\phi$"" reflection isometry and the matter
fields respect the reflection isometry. In addition, we prove that a necessary
and sufficient condition for the constancy of the surface gravity on a Killing
horizon is that the exterior derivative of the twist of the horizon Killing
field vanish on the horizon. As a corollary of this, we recover a result of
Carter that constancy of surface gravity holds for any black hole which is
static or stationary- axisymmetric with the ``$t-\phi$"" reflection isometry. No
use of Einstein's equation is made in obtaining any of the above results. Taken
together, these results support the view that any spacetime representing the
asymptotic final state of a black hole formed by gravitational collapse may be
assumed to possess a bifurcate Killing horizon or a Killing horizon with
vanishing surface gravity.

is generalized allowing for defects in the lattice and written as an Ising
model with nearest-neighbor and plaquette interactions on the honeycomb
lattice. Its phase diagram is determined in the hexagon approximation of the
cluster variation method and the crossover from the pure Ising to the pure
folding model is investigated, obtaining a quite rich structure with several
multicritical points. Our results are in very good agreement with the available
exact ones and extend a previous transfer matrix study.

grand unified theories from 4-dimensional superstrings are presented. Explicit
techniques involving higher level affine Lie algebras, for obtaining such
stringGUTs from symmetric orbifolds are discussed. Special emphasis is put on
the different constraints and selection rules for model building in this string
framework, trying to disentangle those which are generic from those depending
on the orbifold construction proposed. Some phenomenological implications from
such constraints are briefly discussed.

proton polarization over 90\% was achieved in a frozen spin target of 20 cm$^3$

non-covariant QMD approaches, incorporated with the statistical decay model. By
comparing the results of RQMD with those of QMD, we examine the relativistic
effects and find that the multiplicity of the $\alpha$ particle after the
statistical decay process is sensitive to the relativistic effects. It is shown
that the Lorentz covariant approach is necessary to analyze the fragmentation
process even at the energy around \Elab = 1 GeV/u as long as we are concerned
with the final observables of the mass distribution, particularly, the light
fragments around $A = 3 \sim 4$.

systems it is possible to build up approximate eigenfunctions, called {\it
asymptotic eigenfunctions}, which are concentrated as much as one wants to a
classical trajectory and have a lifetime as long as one wants. These states are
directly related to the presence of shell structures in the quantal spectrum of
the system. It is argued that the result can be extended to classically chaotic
system, at least in the asymptotic regime.
