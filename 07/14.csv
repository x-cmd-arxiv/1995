just above the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. They vary by
as much as 0.1 mag on time scales an order of magnitude slower than the
fundamental radial pulsation period. These brightness variations are presumably
due to non-radial gravity-mode pulsations. We obtained high precision $V$-band
photometry of 8 F0 to F5 stars in the Hyades (BS 1319, BS 1354, BS 1385, BS
1408, BS 1430, BS 1432, BS 1459, and BS 1472) and found that none of them
showed strong evidence of $\gamma$ Dor-type variability. Since $\gamma$
Dor-type candidates are found in the Pleiades and in NGC 2516 (having ages of
78 and 137 Myr, repectively) but apparently not in the Hyades (age $>$ 600
Myr), we hypothesize that the $\gamma$ Dor phenomenon is a characteristic of
relatively young F stars.
  Two of the stars investigated showed marginal evidence of low-amplitude
variability. The $\pm$3 mmag variability of the F5 star BS 1319 is most likely
due to rotational modulation of star spots, though it is not impossible that it
is a $\gamma$ Dor star. Another F5 star BS 1459 ($\Delta V = \pm 2$ mmag) has a
possible period similar to $\delta$ Scuti stars, but no firm conclusions should
be made concerning its behavior unless and until its variability is confirmed.

universe has many properties that cannot be explained by a classical
description of them. A quantum state of the universe should obey certain
constraints, such as the Wheeler-DeWitt equations. One approach to interpreting
such a state is {\it Sensible Quantum Mechanics} (SQM), in which nothing is
probabilistic, except, in a certain frequency sense, conscious perceptions.
Sets of these perceptions can be deterministically realized with measures given
by expectation values of positive-operator-valued {\it awareness operators}.
These may be defined even when the quantum state itself is not normalizable,
though there still seem to be problems of divergences when one has an infinite
amount of inflation, producing infinitely large spatial volumes with presumably
infinite measures of perceptions. Ratios of the measures for sets of
perceptions (if finite) can be interpreted as frequency-type probabilities for
many actually existing sets rather than as propensities for potentialities to
be actualized, so there is nothing indeterministic in a specific SQM. One can
do a Bayesian analysis to test between different specific SQMs. One can also
make statistical predictions of what one might perceive within a specific SQM
by invoking the {\it Conditional Aesthemic Principle}: among the set of all
conscious perceptions, our perceptions are likely to be typical.

(~$s_x, \; \sigma_x$~) with independent hopping parameters $\kappa_1,

is solely responsible for breaking the global $ Z_2 \times Z_2$ symmetry down
to $Z_2$. This model is intended as an illustration of general coupled Higgs
system where scalars can arise both as composite and elementary excitations.
For the Ising example in 2d, we give convincing numerical evidence of the
universality of the two spin system with the one spin Ising model, by Monte
Carlo simulations and finite scaling analysis . We also show that as we
approach the phase transition, universality arises by a separation of low mass
spin waves from an extra set of spin waves with an energy gap that diverges as
the correlations length diverges

experimental data and therefore can be applied to any hadronic spectral
function. As an illustration of this technique the Laplace sum-rules of the
light-quark correlation function for the vector and the axial-vector currents

is still absent but there is a nonzero inflow of particles towards ${\bf p} =
{\bf 0}$ and the distribution function at ${\bf p} ={\bf 0}$ grows from finite
values to infinity in a finite time. We observe a profound similarity between
Bose-condensation and Kolmogorov turbulence. At the second stage there are two
components, the condensate and particles, reaching their equilibrium values. We
show that the evolution in both stages proceeds in a self-similar way and find
the time needed for condensation. We do not consider a phase transition from
the first stage to the second. Condensation of self-interacting bosons is
compared to the condensation driven by interaction with a cold gas of fermions;
the latter turns out to be self-similar too. Exploiting the self-similarity we
obtain a number of analytical results in all cases.

configurations generating the structure of the nucleon Spectral Function at
high values of the nucleon momentum and removal energy, can be properly
described by a factorised ansatz for the nuclear wave function, which leads to
a nucleon Spectral Function in the form of a convolution integral involving the
momentum distributions describing the relative and center-of-mass motion of a
correlated nucleon-nucleon pair embedded in the medium. The Spectral Functions
of $^3He$ and infinite nuclear matter resulting from the convolution formula
and from many-body calculations are compared, and a very good agreement in a
wide range of values of nucleon momentum and removal energy is found.
Applications of the model to the analysis of inclusive and exclusive processes
are presented, illustrating those features of the cross section which are
sensitive to that part of the Spectral Function which is governed by
short-range and tensor nucleon-nucleon correlations.
