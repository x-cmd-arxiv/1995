  Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/309677","DAO-9522","astro-ph",,"  HST B and I images are presented of 32 CFRS galaxies with secure redshifts in
the range 0.5 < z < 1.2. These galaxies exhibit the same range of morphological
types as seen locally, i.e., ellipticals, spirals and irregulars. The galaxies
look far less regular in the $B$ images (rest-frame ultraviolet) than at longer
wavelengths, underlining the fact that optical images of galaxies at still
higher redshift should be interpreted with caution. Quantitative analyses of
the galaxies yield disk sizes, bulge fractions, and colors for each component.
At these redshifts, galaxy disks show clear evidence for surface brightness
evolution. The mean rest-frame central surface brightness of the disks of
normal late-type galaxies is mu_{AB}(B)=20.2 \pm 0.25 mag arcsec^{-2}, about
1.2 mag brighter than the Freeman (1970) value. Some degree of peculiarity is
measurable in 10 (30%) of the galaxies and 4 (13%) show clear signs of
interaction/mergers. There are 9 galaxies (30%) dominated by blue compact
components. These components, which appear to be related to star formation,
occur most often in peculiar/asymmetric galaxies (some of which appear to be
interacting), but a few are in otherwise normal galaxies. Thus, of the galaxies
bluer than present-day Sb, one-third are ""blue nucleated galaxies"", and half
are late-type galaxies with disks which are significantly brighter than normal
galaxies at z=0. Taken together, these two effects must be responsible for much
of the observed evolution of the luminosity function of blue galaxies.

observations of the optical counterpart of the LMC ""supersoft"" X-ray source RX
J0513.9-6951 (identified with HV 5682) is presented. The spectrum is dominated
by He II emission lines and H + He II blends; no He I is observed but several
higher ionization emission features, especially O VI (3811, 3834, and 5290A)
are prominent. Radial velocity measurements suggest a binary period of 0.76
days. If the small velocity amplitude, K~11 km/s, is interpreted as orbital
motion, this implies that the binary system contains a somewhat evolved star
plus a relatively massive compact object, viewed nearly pole-on. No orbital
photometric variations were found, although irregular brightness changes of
~0.3 mag occurred. Unusual emission lines are observed which cannot be
identified except as high velocity (4000 km/s) bipolar outflows or jets. These
outflows are seen in H and He II at the same positive and negative velocities.
They were relatively stable for periods of ~5 days, but their velocities appear
to have been ~250 km/s smaller in 1992 than in 1993 or 1994.

the form of an integral equation suitable for numerical discretization to solve
the quantum billiard. This paper is an extensive numerical survey of BIM in a
variety of quantum billiards, integrable (circle, rectangle), KAM systems
(Robnik billiard) and fully chaotic (ergodic, such as stadium, Sinai billiard
and cardioid billiard). On the theoretical side we point out some serious flaws
in the derivation of BIM in the literature and show how the final formula
(which nevertheless was correct) should be derived in a sound way and we also
argue that a simple minded application of BIM in nonconvex geometries presents
serious difficulties or even fails. On the numerical side we have analyzed the
scaling of the averaged absolute value of the systematic error $\Delta E$ of
the eigenenergy in units of mean level spacing with the density of
discretization ($b$ = number of numerical nodes on the boundary within one de
Broglie wavelength), and we find that in all cases the error obeys a power law
$ <|\Delta E|> = A b^{-\alpha}$, where $ \alpha $ (and also $A$) varies from
case to case (it is not universal), and is affected strongly by the existence
of exterior chords in nonconvex geometries, whereas the degree of the classical
chaos seems to be practically irrelevant. We comment on the semiclassical limit
of BIM and make suggestions about a proper formulation with correct
semiclassical limit in nonconvex geometries.

curvature and non-trivial dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields. The full
spectrum of string excitations is derived as a function of moduli fields
$T^{i}$ and the scale $\mu^2=1/(k+2)$ which is induced by the non-zero
background fields. The spectrum of string excitations has a non-zero mass gap
$\mu^2$ and in the weak curvature limit ($\mu$ small) $\mu^2$ plays the role of
a well defined infrared regulator, consistent with modular invariance, gauge
invariance, supersymmetry and chirality.
  The effects of a covariantly constant (chomo)magnetic field $H$ as well as
additional curvature can be derived exactly up to one string-loop level. Thus,
the one-loop corrections to all couplings (gravitational, gauge and Yukawas)
are unambiguously computed and are finite both in the UltraViolet and the
InfraRed regime. These corrections are necessary for quantitative string
superunification predictions at low energies. The one-loop corrections to the
couplings are also found to satisfy Infrared Flow Equations. Having in our
disposal an exact description which goes beyond the leading order in the
$\alpha'$-expansion or the linearized approximation in the magnetic field, we
find interesting clues about the physics of string theory in strong
gravitational and magnetic fields. In particular, the nature of gravitational
or magnetic instabilities is studied.

4He to 7Li have been performed with a multi-valued G-matrix effective
interaction, as recently suggested by Haxton et al.. Calculations were
performed relative to the vacuum (``no core"") using very large, separable model
spaces containing all excitations with unperturbed energies up to 8\hbar\Omega.
Using G matrices derived from a new Nijmegen potential, we achieve a very
satisfactory description of these excitations.

static quadrupole moments of the low spin states 2+_1 and 4+_1 are negative but
those of the high spin states 10+_1, 12+_1 and 14+_1 are positive. Even spin
states beyond the single j shell limit, J_max=14, again have negative moments.
While the B(E2)'s for the J -> J-2 transitions are strongest along the yrast
path for J <= 8, it is found that the transition from the second J=10 state to
the first J=8 state (10+_2 -> 8+_1) is much stronger than the 10+_1 -> 8+_1
transition. We also note that while the 16+_1 -> 14+_1 transition is weak, the
16+_1 -> 14+_2 is quite strong.

Hermitian operators is too narrow to discuss measurements of such important
physical quantities as elapsed time or harmonic-oscillator phase. We introduce
a broader framework that allows us to derive quantum-mechanical limits on the
precision to which a parameter---e.g., elapsed time---may be determined via
arbitrary data analysis of arbitrary measurements on $N$ identically prepared
quantum systems. The limits are expressed as generalized Mandelstam-Tamm
uncertainty relations, which involve the operator that generates displacements
of the parameter---e.g., the Hamiltonian operator in the case of elapsed time.
This approach avoids entirely the problem of associating a Hermitian operator
with the parameter. We illustrate the general formalism, first, with
nonrelativistic uncertainty relations for spatial displacement and momentum,
harmonic-oscillator phase and number of quanta, and time and energy and,
second, with Lorentz-invariant uncertainty relations involving the displacement
and Lorentz-rotation parameters of the Poincar\'e group.
