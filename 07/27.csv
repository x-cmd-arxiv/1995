perturbative theory for the structure functions and the response functions of

perturbative expansions that suffer from infra-red divergences can be exactly
resummed using the Belinicher-L'vov transformation. After this exact (partial)
resummation it is proven that the resulting perturbation theory is free of
divergences, both in large and in small spatial separations. The hydrodynamic
response and the correlations have contributions that arise from mediated
interactions which take place at some space- time coordinates. It is shown that
the main contribution arises when these coordinates lie within a shell of a
""ball of locality"" that is defined and discussed. We argue that the real
space-time formalism developed here offers a clear and intuitive understanding
of every diagram in the theory, and of every element in the diagrams. One major
consequence of this theory is that none of the familiar perturbative mechanisms
may ruin the classical Kolmogorov (K41) scaling solution for the structure
functions. Accordingly, corrections to the K41 solutions should be sought in
nonperturbative effects. These effects are the subjects of papers II and III in
this series, that will propose a mechanism for anomalous scaling in turbulence,
which in particular allows multiscaling of the structure functions.

turbulence and commence the analysis of nonperturbative effects that form the
analytic basis of anomalous scaling. Starting from the Navier-Stokes equations
(at high Reynolds number Re) we discuss the simplest examples of the appearance
of anomalous exponents in fluid mechanics. These examples are the nonlinear
(four-point) Green's function and related quantities. We show that the
renormalized perturbation theory for these functions contains ``ladder``
diagrams with (convergent!) logarithmic terms that sum up to anomalous
exponents. Using a new sum rule which is derived here we calculate the leading
anomalous exponent and show that it is critical in a sense made precise below.
This result opens up the possibility of multiscaling of the structure functions
with the outer scale of turbulence as the renormalization length. This
possibility will be discussed in detail in the concluding paper III of this

structure functions of velocity differences that satisfy inertial range scaling
laws $S_n(R)\sim R^{\zeta_n}$, and the correlation of energy dissipation
$K_{\epsilon\epsilon}(R) \sim R^{-\mu}$. The goal is to understand the
exponents $\zeta_n$ and $\mu$ from first principles. In paper II of this series
it was shown that the existence of an ultraviolet scale (the dissipation scale
$\eta$) is associated with a spectrum of anomalous exponents that characterize
the ultraviolet divergences of correlations of gradient fields. The leading
scaling exponent in this family was denoted $\Delta$. The exact resummation of
ladder diagrams resulted in the calculation of $\Delta$ which satisfies the
scaling relation $\Delta=2-\zeta_2$. In this paper we continue our analysis and
show that nonperturbative effects may introduce multiscaling (i.e. $\zeta_n$
not being linear in $n$) with the renormalization scale being the infrared
outer scale of turbulence $L$. It is shown that deviations from K41 scaling of
$S_n(R)$ ($\zeta_n\neq n/3$) must appear if the correlation of dissipation is
mixing (i.e. $\mu>0$). We derive an exact scaling relation $\mu =
2\zeta_2-\zeta_4$. We present analytic expressions for $\zeta_n$ for all $n$
and discuss their relation to experimental data. One surprising prediction is
that the time decay constant $\tau_n(R)\propto R^{z_n}$ of $S_n(R)$ scales
independently of $n$: the dynamic scaling exponent $z_n$ is the same for all
$n$-order quantities, $z_n=\zeta_2$.

phenomenology of the particle-physics standard model. The analysis is
restricted to those values of the tree-level-potential parameters for which the
absolute minima of the classical potential have been evaluated. As shown in the
recent literature, such minima turn out to be SO(6)xSO(4)- or
SU(3)xSU(2)xSU(2)xU(1)-invariant. Electroweak phenomenology is more naturally
derived, however, from the former minima. Hence the values of the parameters
leading to the alternative set of minima have been discarded. Within this
framework, flat-space limit and general form of the one-loop effective
potential are studied in detail by using analytic and numerical methods. It
turns out that, as far as the absolute-minimum direction is concerned, the
flat-space limit of the one-loop calculation about a de Sitter background does
not change the results previously obtained in the literature, where the
tree-level potential in flat space-time was studied. Moreover, when curvature

periods, the mirror maps and Yukawa couplings for multi-moduli Calabi-Yau
varieties. In Part A of this paper, motivated by the recent work of
Kachru-Vafa, we degenerate a three-moduli family of Calabi-Yau toric varieties
along a codimension one subfamily which can be described by the vanishing of
certain Mori coordinate, corresponding to going to the ``large volume limit''
in a certain direction. Then we see that the deformation space of the subfamily
is the same as a certain family of K3 toric surfaces. This family can in turn
be studied by further degeneration along a subfamily which in the end is
described by a family of elliptic curves. The periods of the K3 family (and
hence the original Calabi-Yau family) can be described by the squares of the
periods of the elliptic curves. The consequences include: (1) proofs of various
conjectural formulas of physicists \vk\lkm~ involving mirror maps and modular
functions; (2) new identities involving multi-variable hypergeometric series
and modular functions -- generalizing \lianyaufour. In Part B, we study for
two-moduli families the perturbation series of the mirror map and the type A
Yukawa couplings near certain large volume limits. Our main tool is a new class
of polynomial PDEs associated with Fuchsian PDE systems. We derive the first
few terms in the perturbation series. For the case of degree 12 hypersurfaces
in $\P^4[6,2,2,1,1]$, in one limit the series of the couplings are expressed in
terms of the $j$ function. In another limit, they are expressed in terms of
rational functions. The latter give explicit formulas for infinite sequences of
``instanton numbers'' $n_d$.

  Hypothesis",,,,"Logic E-prints July 27, 1995","math.LO",,"  We prove several results giving lower bounds for the large cardinal strength
of a failure of the singular cardinal hypothesis. The main result is the
following theorem:
  Theorem: Suppose $\kappa$ is a singular strong limit cardinal and $2^\kappa
>= \lambda$ where $\lambda$ is not the successor of a cardinal of cofinality at
most $\kappa$.
  (i) If $\cofinality(\kappa)>\gw$ then $o(\kappa)\ge\lambda$.
  (ii) If $\cofinality(\kappa)=\gw$ then either $o(\kappa)\ge\lambda$ or
$\set{\ga:K\sat o(\ga)\ge\ga^{+n}}$ is cofinal in $\kappa$ for each $n\in\gw$.

of indiscernibles which come from applying the covering lemma to nonoverlapping
sequences of extenders.
