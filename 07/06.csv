ordering markers associated with radiation hybrid data. Motivated by recent
work of Boehnke et al. [1], we formulate the ordering problem by developing
stochastic spin models to search for minimum-break marker configurations. As a
particular application, the methods developed are applied to 14 human
chromosome-21 markers tested by Cox et al. [2]. The methods generate
configurations consistent with the best found by others. Additionally, we find
that the set of low-lying configurations is described by a Markov-like ordering
probability distribution. The distribution displays cluster correlations
reflecting closely linked loci.

seeded by $3\sigma$ density perturbations to an Einstein--de Sitter universe is
studied here for a variety of scale-free power spectra with spectral indices
ranging from $n=1$ to $-2$. Initial conditions are set by the constrained
realization algorithm and the dynamical evolution is calculated both
analytically and numerically. The analytic calculation is based on the simple
secondary infall model where spherical symmetry is assumed. A full numerical
simulation is performed by a Tree N-body code where no symmetry is assumed. A
hybrid calculation has been performed by using a monopole term code, where no
symmetry is imposed on the particles but the force is approximated by the
monopole term only. The main purpose of using such code is to suppress
off-center mergers. In all cases studied here the rotation curves calculated by
the two numerical codes are in agreement over most of the mass of the halos,
excluding the very inner region, and these are compared with the analytically
calculated ones. The main result obtained here, reinforces the foundings of
many N-body experements, is that the collapse proceeds 'gently' and not {\it
via} violent relaxation. There is a strong correlation of the final energy of
individual particles with the initial one. In particular we find a preservation
of the ranking of particles according to their binding energy. In cases where
the analytic model predicts non-increasing rotation curves its predictions are
confirmed by the simulations. Otherwise, sensitive dependence on initial
conditions is found and the analytic model fails completely.

between binary systems imply a `halo' distribution of young stars over large

reduced binary proportion and a significantly increased proportion of stars

pre-main sequence stars, most of them being weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTS).
These T Tauri stars have been identified in the course of optical follow-up
observations of sources from the ROSAT All Sky Survey associated with star
forming regions. The areas surveyed include the T associations of Chamaeleon
and Lupus as well as Upper Scorpius, the latter being part of the Scorpius
Centaurus OB association (Sco OB 2).
  Using SUSI at the NTT under subarcsec seeing conditions we observed 195 T
Tauri stars through a 1$\mu$m (""Z"") filter and identified companions to 31 of
them (among these 12 subarcsec binaries). Based on statistical arguments we
conclude that almost all of them are indeed physical (i.e. gravitationally
bound) binary or multiple systems. For 10 systems located in Upper Scorpius and
Lupus, we additionally obtained spatially resolved near-infrared photometry in
the J, H, and K bands with the MPIA 2.2m telescope at ESO, La Silla. The
near-infrared colours of the secondaries are consistent with those of dwarfs
and are clearly distinct from those of late type giant stars. Based on
astrometric measurements of some binaries we show that the components of these
binaries are common proper motion pairs, very likely in a gravitationally bound
orbit around each other.
  We find that the overall binary frequency among T Tauri stars in a range of
separations between 120 and 1800 AU is in agreement with the binary frequency
observed among main sequence stars in the solar neighbourhood. However, we note
  that within individual regions the spatial distribution of binaries -- within

verify the conjecture for $r=1$, and more generally for Drinfeld modules having

Moreover, we show that within an $\Lbar$-isomorphism class, there are only

in order to reduce the dimension of the coupled-channels equations for
heavy-ion reactions based on the no-Coriolis approximation. Our method is
superior to other methods in that it easily enables us to study the cases where
the initial spin of the colliding particle is not zero. It can also be easily
applied to the cases where the internal degrees of freedom are not necessarily
collective coordinates. We also clarify the underlying assumptions in our
approach.

  fusion potential","13 pages, Latex",,,,"nucl-th",,"  We discuss the effects of fast nuclear excitations on heavy-ion fusion
reactions at energies near and below the Coulomb barrier. Using the fusion of
two $^{40}$Ca nuclei as an example and the inversion method, we show that the
mass renormalization induced by fast nuclear excitations leads to a large
surface diffuseness in the effective potential for heavy-ion fusion reactions.

a new observable to characterize cells of different types. We propose that it
is possible to distinguish cancerous from healthy cells with the aid of this
new approach. As a first application we show that it is possible to perform
this distinction between patients with hairy-cell lymphocytic leukemia and
those with normal blood lymphocytes.

geometry, based on a generalized permutation, is used to construct linear
connections on GL_q(n). Restrictions on the generalized permutation arising
from the stability of linear connections under involution are discussed.
Candidates for generalized permutation on GL_q(n) are found. It is shown that,
for a given generalized permutation, there exists one and only one associated
linear connection. Properties of the linear connection are discussed, in
particular its bicovariance, torsion and commutative limit.

applied to the path-integral formalism. For this purpose the unitary definition
of the quantum measure, which guarantees the conservation of total probability,
is offered. As the examples, the phase space transformation to the canonically
conjugate pare $(energy, time)$ and the transformation to the cylindrical
coordinates are shown. The transformations of the path-integral measure looks
classically but they can not be deduced from naive transformations of quantum
trajectories.
