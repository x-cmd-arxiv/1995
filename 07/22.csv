more dramatic structures in the large-scale distribution of galaxies. In
particular, the CfA2 and SSRS2 surveys to an apparent magnitude limit of 15.5

of the large-scale structure in the universe results from the gravitational
amplification of the primordial small perturbations of density. The primordial
density perturbations, as quantum fluctuations at the very early stage, may
reveal important information about the early universe and the laws of
fundamental physics. One of the major obstacles to understanding the formation
of the large-scale structure is the complexity of the evolution of the density
inhomogeneities at the nonlinear stage when the observable structures form. One
way of addressing this problem is to run three-dimensional numerical
simulations. Here we review another approach based on the approximate analytic
model of the nonlinear gravitational instability utilizing Burgers' equation of

The dominant second and third family contributions in the Dirac sector are
renormalizable, while the remaining contributions to the Dirac mass matrices

and efficient treatment of fractional exclusion statistics. By using the
exclusion-inclusion principle recently proposed [Phys. Rev. E49, 5103 (1994)]
as a generalization of the Pauli exclusion principle, which is based on a
proper definition of the transition probability between two states, we derive a
variety of different statistical distributions interpolating between bosons and
fermions. The Haldane exclusion principle and the Haldane-Wu fractional
exclusion statistics are obtained in a natural way as particular cases. The
thermodynamic properties of the statistical systems obeying the generalized
exclusion-inclusion principle are discussed.

These results can be interpreted as stability results for certain structures of
PL functions on the circle. Machinery is developed to relate the structures on
the circle to corresponding structures on the line.

scheme for Hamiltonian systems is proposed, holding in the standard phase
