which heuristically take into account the presence of turbulence; in
particular, we consider equations of state which are {\it softer} than
isothermal. We take the unperturbed cloud configuration to be in hydrostatic
equilibrium. We find a class of wave solutions which propagate along a pressure
supported cylinder (or slab) and have finite (trapped) spatial distributions in
the direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Our results
indicate that the dispersion relations for these two dimensional waves have
similar forms for the two geometries considered here. Both cases possess a
regime of instability and a fastest growing mode. We also find the

Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for star formation and
molecular clouds. The mass scales set by instabilities in both molecular cloud
filaments and sheets are generally much larger than the masses of stars.
However, these instabilities can determine the length scales for the initial

diffraction and transmission electron microscopy experiments show that the
layers are heavily intermixed although a composition gradient is maintained.
When the spacer layer is an amorphous iron silicide, the magnetic properties of
the multilayers are similar to those of bulk Fe. When the spacer layer is a
crystalline silicide with the B2 or DO$_3$ structure, the multilayers show
antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling like that observed in
ferromagnet/paramagnet multilayers such as Fe/Cr and Co/Cu. Depending on the
substrate type and the growth temperature, the multilayers grow in either the

coupling is dependent on the crystallinity of the iron and iron silicide
layers, but does not seem to be strongly affected by the perfection of the
layering or the orientation of the film. Since the B2- and DO$_3$-structure
Fe$\rm _x$Si$\rm _{1-x}$ compounds are known to be metallic, antiferromagnetic
interlayer coupling in Fe/Si multilayers probably originates from the same
quantum-well and Fermi surface effects as in Fe/Cr and Co/Cu multilayers.

consistent with BBN. The BBN bounds on sterile neutrinos mixing with electron
neutrinos can also be weakened considerably.

mapping the theory of complex structure deformations of the conifold to
Chern-Simons theory on $S^3$. These results, in conjunction with similar

leading to loosely bound s, p and d orbits of 13-C is well reproduced by the

potential barrier, for various penetration depths $x_{\rm f}$; \ (ii) putting
forth and discussing suitable definitions, besides of the mean values, also of
the {\em variances} (or dispersions) ${\rm D} \, {\tau_{\rm T}}$ and ${\rm D}
\, {\tau_{\, \rm R}}$ for the time durations of transmission and reflection
processes; \ (iii) mentioning, moreover, that our definition $<\tau_{\rm T}>$
for the average transmission time results to constitute an {\em improvement} of
the ordinary dwell--time ${\ove \tau}^{\rm Dw}$ formula: \ (iv) commenting, at
last, on the basis of our {\em new} numerical results, upon some recent
criticism by C.R.Leavens. \ \ We stress that our numerical evaluations {\em
confirm} that our approach implied, and implies, the existence of the {\em
Hartman effect}: an effect that in these days (due to the theoretical
connections between tunnelling and evanescent--wave propagation) is receiving
---at Cologne, Berkeley, Florence and Vienna--- indirect, but quite
interesting, experimental verifications. \ Eventually, we briefly analyze some
other definitions of tunnelling times.
