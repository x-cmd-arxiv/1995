standard Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of
cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high
resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy
halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density
profiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a
simple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or
equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way
which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo
profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are
significantly shallower than $r^{-2}$ near the center and steeper than $r^{-2}$
near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies
requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity.
Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on
galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the
disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are
uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral
systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the
presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster
medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of
cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two
shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent
with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted
abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.

electron-electron interactions. In the latter case, significant renormalization

algorithm for finding apparent horizons in 3+1 numerical relativity.
  We describe a method for computing the Jacobian matrix of the finite
differenced $H(h)$ function by symbolically differentiating the finite
difference equations, giving the Jacobian elements directly in terms of the
finite difference molecule coefficients used in computing $H(h)$. Assuming the
finite differencing scheme commutes with linearization, we show how the
Jacobian elements may be computed by first linearizing the continuum $H(h)$
equations, then finite differencing the linearized (continuum) equations.
  We find this symbolic differentiation method of computing the $H(h)$ Jacobian
to be {\em much} more efficient than the usual numerical perturbation method,
and also much easier to implement than is commonly thought.
  When solving the discrete $H(h) = 0$ equations, we find that Newton's method
generally converges very rapidly. However, if the initial guess for the horizon
position contains significant high-spatial-frequency error components, Newton's
method has a small (poor) radius of convergence. This is {\em not} an artifact
of insufficient resolution in the finite difference grid; rather, it appears to
be caused by a strong nonlinearity in the continuum $H(h)$ function for
high-spatial-frequency error components in $h$. Robust variants of Newton's
method can boost the radius of convergence by O(1) factors, but the underlying
nonlinearity remains, and appears to worsen rapidly with increasing
initial-guess-error spatial frequency.
  Using 4th~order finite differencing, we find typical accuracies for computed
horizon positions in the $10^{-5}$ range for $\Delta\theta = \frac{\pi/2}{50}$.
