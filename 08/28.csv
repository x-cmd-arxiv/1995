elliptical galaxies in five nearby clusters. We measure photometric parameters
for each galaxy using surface photometry and draw velocity dispersions from the
literature. Three observables define a near-infrared Fundamental Plane (FP) of
elliptical galaxies with $R_e \propto \sigma^{1.44\pm0.04}
\Sigma_e^{-0.79\pm0.04}$. The scatter in the near-infrared relation is small at
$16.5$\% in distance, which is equivalent to, or less than, the scatter of the
optical FP. We suggest that the small deviation of the near-infrared FP
relation from the optical FP is due to the reduction of metallicity effects in
the near-infrared bandpass. While the small scatter of the optical FP could be
consistent with compensating effects of age and metallicity, the similarly
small scatter of the near-infrared FP is nearly independent of metallicity and
hence places a strong constraint on possible age spreads among elliptical
galaxies at every point along the FP. We suggest that the departure of the
near-infrared FP from the pure virial form $R_e \propto \sigma^2
\Sigma_e^{-1}$, and the corresponding observed relation $\left( M/L \right)
\propto M^{0.16\pm 0.01}$, may be explained by slight systematic departures of
the structure and dynamics of elliptical galaxies from a homology.

flux tube approximation together with a simplified radiative heat exchange with
the surroundings is used to study the evolution of a flux tube embedded into a
background given by a global magneto-static sunspot model. The investigation is
undertaken in order to verify the conjecture that convection in sunspot
penumbrae occurs by an interchange of magnetic flux tubes. The code being
developed can be used to study dynamic aspects of filamentary structure in the
penumbra: the temporal and spatial fluctuations of the temperature and the
magnetic field, the motion of bright penumbral grains, or the Evershed effect.
Here we present the evolution of a wave formed by the tube whose fragment
emerges in the penumbral photosphere and migrates towards the umbra. The
properties of this wave show qualitative features of the observed bright
penumbral grains with corresponding upward velocity and its correlation with
brightness and the inclination of the magnetic field, and also of the Evershed
effect.

display no evidence of any velocity gradient. This size, together with optical
and IR data that show the galaxy is probably gravitationally lensed, lead to a
new model for the CO distribution. In contrast to many lensed objects, we have
a good estimate of the intrinsic CO and far IR surface brightnesses, so we can
derive the CO and far IR/sub-mm magnifications. The CO is magnified 10 times
and has a true radius of 400 pc. and the far IR is magnified 13 times and has a
radius of 250 pc. The true far IR luminosity is 4 to 7e12 Lsun and the
molecular gas mass is 2e10 Msun . This is nearly an order of magnitude less
than previously estimated. Because the far IR magnification is lower than the
mid and near IR magnification, the intrinsic spectral energy distribution now
peaks in the far infrared. That is, nearly all of the energy of this object is
absorbed and re-emitted in the far infrared. In CO luminosity, molecular gas
content, CO linewidth, and corrected far IR luminosity, 10214+472 is a typical,

previously been shown, in the last regime, the behavior of the above quantities
agrees well with the predictions of a renormalization group treatment of the
appropriate nonlinear sigma model. For $T > T_{th}$, a satisfactory fit of the

Lorentz invariance of the laws of physics does not imply that space-time is

would feel a relativistic space-time even if the actual space-time had a quite
different geometry (f.i. a galilean space-time). If Lorentz invariance is only
a property of equations describing a sector of matter at a given scale, an
absolute frame (the ""vacuum rest frame"") may exist without contradicting the
minkowskian structure felt by ordinary particles. Then c , the speed of light,
will not necessarily be the only critical speed in vacuum and superluminal
sectors of matter may equally exist feeling space-times with critical speeds
larger than c . We present a discussion of possible cosmological implications
of such a scenario, assuming that the superluminal sectors couple weakly to
ordinary matter. The universality of the equivalence between inertial and
gravitational mass will be lost. The Big Bang scenario will undergo important
modifications, and the evolution of the Universe may be strongly influenced by

used an approach that enforces the spacetime of cosmic strings to also satisfy
the conservation laws of a cylindric gravitational topological defect, that is
a spacetime kink. In the simplest case of kink number unity, the entire energy
range of supermassive strings becomes then quantized so that only cylindrical
defects with linear energy density $G\mu=1/4$ (critical string) and $G\mu=1/2$
(extreme string) are allowed to occur in this range. It has been seen that the
internal spherical coordinate $\theta$ of the string metric embedded in an
Euclidean three-space also evolves on imaginary values, leading to the creation
of a covering shell of broken phase that protects the core with trapped energy,
even for $G\mu=1/2$. Then the conical singularity becomes a removable horizaon
singularity. We re-express the extreme string metric in the Finkelstein-
McCollum standard form and remove the geodesic incompleteness by using the
Kruskal technique. The z=const. sections of the resulting metric are the same
as the hemispherical section of the metric of a De Sitter kink. Some physical
consequences from these results, including the possibility that the extreme
string drives inflation and thermal effects in its core, are also discussed.
