from N-body simulations, or indeed from any general density and velocity
fluctuation field sampled by discrete points. These methods, the {\it Voronoi
tessellation method} and {\it Delaunay tessellation method}, are based on the
use of the Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations of the point distribution defined
by the locations at which the velocity field is sampled. In the Voronoi method
the velocity is supposed to be uniform within the Voronoi polyhedra, whereas
the Delaunay method constructs a velocity field by linear interpolation between
the four velocities at the locations defining each Delaunay tetrahedron. The
most important advantage of these methods is that they provide an optimal
estimator for determining the statistics of volume-averaged quantities, as
opposed to the available numerical methods that mainly concern mass-averaged
quantities. As the major share of the related analytical work on velocity field
statistics has focussed on volume-averaged quantities, the availability of
appropriate numerical estimators is of crucial importance for checking the
validity of the analytical perturbation calculations. In addition, it allows us
to study the statistics of the velocity field in the highly nonlinear
clustering regime. Although in most cases both the Voronoi and the Delaunay
method lead to equally good velocity field estimates, the Delaunay method may
be slightly preferable. In particular it performs considerably better at small
radii. Note that it is more CPU-time intensive while its requirement for memory
space is almost a factor 8 lower than the Voronoi method.

in the cosmic microwave background. Distortions in the frequency or spectral
distribution of the background probe the thermal history of the universe
whereas those in the angular temperature distribution probe its dynamics and
geometry. Stressing model independent results, we show how the microwave
background can be used to extract information on the mass density, vacuum
density, baryon content, radiation content, expansion rate and some aspects of
structure formation in the universe. To address these issues, we systematically
develop relativistic kinetic and perturbation theory addressing issues such as
fluctuation representation, or gauge, normal mode analysis in an open geometry,
and second order effects. Through analytic and numerical results, we construct
anisotropies in a critical, open, or cosmological constant universe with
adiabatic and/or isocurvature initial conditions allowing for possible early
reionization. We find that anisotropy formation is a simple process governed by
the Compton scattering of photons and electrons and their gravitational
coupling to the other particle species in the universe.

via ion-beam sputtering on both glass and single-crystal substrates. High-angle
x-ray diffraction measurements show that both sets of films have narrow Fe
peaks, implying a large crystallite size and crystalline iron silicide spacer
layers. Low-angle x-ray diffraction measurements show that films grown on glass
have rougher interfaces than those grown on single-crystal substrates. The
multilayers grown on glass have a larger remanent magnetization than the
multilayers grown on single-crystal substrates. The observation of
magnetocrystalline anisotropy in hysteresis loops and $(hkl)$ peaks in x-ray
diffraction demonstrates that the films grown on MgO and Ge are epitaxial. The
smaller remanent magnetization in Fe/Si multilayers with better layering
suggests that the remanence is not an intrinsic property.

contribution to the Bjorken sum rule as well. The leading perturbative
correction to the Bjorken sum rule is increased by the factor 4/3 for light
quarks and 5/3 for heavy quarks. The resulting value for the Bjorken sum rule
for light quarks is in excellent agreement with the most precise SLAC data. The
same correction should appear in the case of the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum
rule. It completely removes the observed deficit of this sum rule within the
experimental errors.

diagrams in general is first written in the worldline path-integral expression.
Then we integrate over $x(\tau)$, and the resulting expression is given in
terms of correlation function on the worldline $\left< x(\tau) x(\tau')
\right>$. Simple rules to decompose the correlation function into basic
elements are obtained. Gauge transformation known as integration by parts
technique can be used to reduce the number of independent terms before
integration over proper-time variables. The surface terms can be omitted
provided the external scalars are on-shell. Also, we clarify correspondence to
the conventional Feynman rule, which enabled us to avoid any ambiguity coming
from the infinite dimensionality of the path-integral approach.

solved and the energy spectrum of created particles is determined in a
semi-classical approximation. For large enough coupling or large enough
amplitude the resulting energy spectrum is broadly distributed, implying larger
production of high energy particles than what a simple estimate of the
reheating temperature due to the Born formula would suggest.
