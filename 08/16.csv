singularities in characteristic zero. Our proof applies in particular to
schemes of finite type and to analytic spaces (so we recover the great theorems
of Hironaka). We introduce a discrete local invariant $\inv_X (a)$ whose
maximum locus determines a smooth centre of blowing up, leading to
desingularization. To define $\inv_X$, we need only to work with a category of
local-ringed spaces $X=(|X|,{\cal O}_X)$ satisfying certain natural conditions.
If $a\in |X|$, then $\inv_X(a)$ depends only on $\widehat{\cal O}_{X,a}$. More
generally, $\inv_X(a)$ is defined inductively after any sequence of blowings-up
whose centres have only normal crossings with respect to the exceptional
divisors and lie in the constant loci of $\inv_X(\cdot)$. The paper is
self-contained and includes detailed examples. One of our goals is that the
reader understand the desingularization theorem, rather than simply ``know'' it
is true.

drift should be widely spread due to both Alfv\'{e}nic waves and ambipolar

with a radiative flux, it is shown, that mechanical alignment may be present
even in the absence of supersonic drift. This means that the range of
applicability of mechanical alignment is wider that it is generally accepted
and it can rival the paramagnetic one. We also study the latter mechanism and
reexamine the interplay between poisoning of active sites and desorption of

are significantly flatter for extinction surveys than for CO spectral line
surveys, even for comparable size ranges. A possible explanation is the
blocking of extinction clouds by larger foreground clouds (occlusion), which
should not affect spectral line surveys much because clouds are resolved in
velocity space along a given line of sight. We present a simple derivation of
the relation between the true and occluded size distributions, assuming clouds
are uniformly distributed in space or the distance to a cloud comples is much
greater than the size of the complex. Because the occlusion is dominated by the
largest clouds, we find that occlusion does not affect the measured size
distribution except for sizes comparable to the largest size, implying that
occlusion is not responsible for the discrepancy if the range in sizes of the
samples is large. However, we find that the range in sizes for many of the
published observed samples is actually quite small, which suggests that
occlusion does affect the extinction sample and/or that the discrepancy could
arise from the different operational definitions and selection effects involved
in the two samples. Size and mass spectra from an IRAS survey (Wood \etal\
1994) suggest that selection effects play a major role in all the surveys. We
conclude that a reliable determination of the ``true"" size and mass spectra of
clouds will require spectral line surveys with very high signal-to-noise and
sufficient resolution and sampling to cover a larger range of linear sizes, as
well as careful attention to selection effects.

velocity measurements are found to be generally consistent with the mean
cluster velocity to within the measurement errors. Halpha equivalent widths
have been measured and compared to previous published data for other known
members of the cluster. A turnover in chromospheric activity around spectral
type M3-M4 is observed. The brown dwarf candidate, located in the cool side of
the turnover, is confirmed to exhibit a strong Halpha variability. It is the
coolest alpha Per candidate member for which spectra are available and for
which chromospheric activity has been measured. Using the LiI doublet at lambda
6707.8 angstroms, we derive upper limits to the atmospheric Li abundance in the
sample and discuss them in the context of the most recent stellar evolutionary
tracks. The non-detection of the LiI line in the spectrum of the brown dwarf
candidate implies a mass greater than 0.08 solar masses, and therefore it is
not a substellar object. However, its position in the HR diagram implies that
this star is indeed very close to the substellar limit.

all correlation functions are correctly recovered in the $U=0$ limit, a
nontrivial result for the slave-boson approach. In addition, it provides a
stringent requirement on the form of $z\is$, which might be also generalized to
alternative slave-boson formalisms (like the spin-rotation-invariant

analytical form) in the lowest nontrivial approximation of the perturbative

vary very rapidly with the photon virtuality near $Q^2=0$.
  We estimate the bound of the pQCD validity region for such processes. For the
process with mass shell photon the obtained bound is very high, and this region
seems beyond opportunities of real experiment. This bound decreases fast with
the increase of $Q^2$, and we expect that the virtual photoproduction at HERA

background). Its 2d action has a flat but topologically non-trivial
10-dimensional target space (there is a mixing of angular coordinate of the
2-plane with an internal compact coordinate). We demonstrate that this theory
has broken supersymmetry but is perturbatively stable if the radius R of the
internal coordinate is larger than R_0=\sqrt{2\a'}. In the Green-Schwarz
formulation the supersymmetry breaking is a consequence of the presence of a
flat but non-trivial connection in the fermionic terms in the action. For R <
R_0 and the magnetic field strength parameter q > R/2\a' there appear
instabilities corresponding to tachyonic winding states. The torus partition
function Z(q,R) is finite for R > R_0 (and vanishes for qR=2n, n=integer). At
the special points qR=2n (2n+1) the model is equivalent to the free superstring
theory compactified on a circle with periodic (antiperiodic) boundary condition
for space-time fermions. Analogous results are obtained for a more general
class of static magnetic flux tube geometries including the a=1 Melvin model.

the system is attracted to this subspace by a potential which we compute.
