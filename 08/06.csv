  http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~alexey/cxb.ps . A&A, in press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We calculate the contribution to the cosmic x-ray background (CXB) of a
population of power law spectrum sources with spectral indices distributed over
a broad range of values. The composite spectrum of this source population is
significantly harder than that given by the power law having the average value
of spectral indices. Starting from spectral distributions which are
approximately those observed from quasars, it is possible to reproduce the CXB
spectrum from ~0.5 keV to ~20 keV. If the spectra of quasars steepen at around
100 keV, the resulting composite spectrum nearly perfectly fits the CXB in the
even broader energy range, up to ~100 keV. The QSO population with broadly
distributed spectral parameters is also characterized by a significant
discrepancy between the results of hard and soft x-ray source counts. The same
population of sources yields about three times more sources at 10 keV than at
the corresponding flux at 1 keV, similarly to what is found from the comparison
of HEAO A-1/Ginga and Einstein/ROSAT measurements. Thus, by allowing the
spectra of QSO's to span a broad range of spectral indices, it is possible to
reproduce both the CXB spectrum and account for the apparent differences in
number counts in different energy bands.

leads by single-mode quantum point contacts. If the contacts are in the regime
of perfect transmission, the conductance shows no Coulomb blockade oscillations
as a function of the gate voltage. In the presence of small reflection in both
contacts, the conductance develops small Coulomb blockade oscillations. As the
temperature of the system is lowered, the amplitude of the oscillations grows,
and eventually sharp periodic peaks in conductance are formed. Away from the
centers of the peaks the conductance vanishes at low temperatures as $T^2$, in
agreement with the theory of inelastic co-tunneling developed for the
weak-tunneling case. Conductance near the center of a peak can be studied using
an analogy with the multichannel Kondo problem. In the case of symmetric
barriers, the peak conductance at $T\to 0$ is of the order of $e^2/\hbar$. In
the asymmetric case, the peak conductance vanishes linearly in temperature.

flavor-nonsinglet and singlet equations with next-to-leading-order $\alpha_s$

we simply solve the integrodifferential equations. Numerical results indicate

two-hundred $Q^2$ steps and more than one-thousand $x$ steps are taken. The
numerical solution is discussed in detail, and evolution results are compared
with $Q^2$ dependent data in CDHSW, SLAC, BCDMS, EMC, NMC, Fermilab-E665, ZEUS,

with the Georgi-Jarlskog texture for the Yukawa coupling matrices.For the large
Yukawa coupling of the charged lepton, i.e.,$\tan\b \gg 1$, the neutrino flavor
mixing increases significantly with running down to the electroweak scale by
the RGE. If one wishes to get the large neutrino flavor mixing $\sin \th_{23}$
at the electroweak scale, which is suggested by the muon neutrino deficit in
the atomospheric neutrino flux, the initial condition $\sin \th_{23}\geq 0.27$
is required at the GUT scale. Combined with the see-saw enhancement of the
neutrino flavor mixing, the large mixing is naturally reproduced by setting the
reasonable initial condition.

governed in the generalized leading logarithmic approximation by the
contribution of the color--singlet compound states of Reggeized gluons. The
interaction between Reggeons is described by the effective hamiltonian, which
in the multi--color limit turns out to be identical to the hamiltonian of the
completely integrable one--dimensional XXX Heisenberg magnet of noncompact spin
$s=0$. The spectrum of the color singlet Reggeon compound states - perturbative
Pomerons and Odderons, is expressed by means of the Bethe Ansatz in terms of
the fundamental $Q-$function, which satisfies the Baxter equation for the XXX
Heisenberg magnet. The exact solution of the Baxter equation is known only in
the simplest case of the compound state of two Reggeons, the BFKL Pomeron. For
higher Reggeon states the method is developed which allows to find its general
solution as an asymptotic series in powers of the inverse conformal weight of
the Reggeon states. The quantization conditions for the conserved charges for
interacting Reggeons are established and an agreement with the results of
numerical solutions is observed. The asymptotic approximation of the energy of
the Reggeon states is defined based on the properties of the asymptotic series,
and the intercept of the three--Reggeon states, perturbative Odderon, is
estimated.
