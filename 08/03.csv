formalism for parsing natural languages. Our algorithm is a natural extension
of the original dynamic programming recognition algorithm which recursively
counts the number of linkages between two words in the input sentence. The
modified algorithm uses the notion of a null link in order to allow a
connection between any pair of adjacent words, regardless of their dictionary
definitions. The algorithm proceeds by making three dynamic programming passes.
In the first pass, the input is parsed using the original algorithm which
enforces the constraints on links to ensure grammaticality. In the second pass,
the total cost of each substring of words is computed, where cost is determined
by the number of null links necessary to parse the substring. The final pass
counts the total number of parses with minimal cost. All of the original
pruning techniques have natural counterparts in the robust algorithm. When used
together with memoization, these techniques enable the algorithm to run
efficiently with cubic worst-case complexity. We have implemented these ideas
and tested them by parsing the Switchboard corpus of conversational English.
This corpus is comprised of approximately three million words of text,
corresponding to more than 150 hours of transcribed speech collected from
telephone conversations restricted to 70 different topics. Although only a
small fraction of the sentences in this corpus are ""grammatical"" by standard
criteria, the robust link grammar parser is able to extract relevant structure
for a large portion of the sentences. We present the results of our experiments
using this system, including the analyses of selected and random sentences from

lead to non--Fermi liquid behavior if the bias between the two sites is tuned

those involving bare impurity tunnelling as well as two--electron--assisted
tunnelling play important roles. These terms generally drive the system away
from the intermediate coupling non--Fermi--liquid fixed point, which has the
character of the two channel Kondo problem. In order to find the non-Fermi
liquid behavior a combination of these terms must be small over a range of
energy scales. The prospects for obtaining these conditions are studied by
analyzing both the weak coupling and the intermediate coupling behavior,
together with the connecting crossover region. Unfortunately, the conclusions
are rather pessimistic. The phase diagram and the important crossover are
analyzed via bosonization and refermionization and some of the results compared
to those obtained from conformal field theory. Finally, an additional non-Fermi

background radiation (EGBR) of the hypothesis that if closed, our universe
possesses time symmetric boundary conditions. For simplicity, attention is
focused on optical wavelengths. The universe is modeled as closed Friedmann-
Roberston-Walker. It is shown that, over a wide range of frequencies,
electromagnetic radiation can propagate largely unabsorbed from the present
epoch into the recollapsing phase, confirming and demonstrating the generality
of results of Davies and Twamley. As a consequence, time symmetric boundary
conditions imply that the optical EGBR is at least twice that due to the
galaxies on our past light cone, and possibly considerably more. It is
therefore possible to test experimentally the notion that if our universe is
closed, it may be in a certain sense time symmetric. The lower bound on the
""excess"" EGBR in a time symmetric universe is consistent with present
observations. Nevertheless, better observations and modelling may soon rule it
out entirely. In addition, many physical complications arise in attempting to
reconcile a transparent future light cone with time symmetric boundary
conditions, thereby providing further arguments against the possibility that
our universe is time symmetric.

odd under $CP$. Correlations among momenta of the initial electron and
final-state fermions are in the Bjorken process sensitive to the $CP$ parity.
Monte Carlo data on the expected efficiency demonstrate that it should be
possible to verify the scalar character of an intermediate-mass Standard Model
Higgs boson after three years of data taking at a future linear collider. This
is most likely not possible at LEP2. Signals of possible presence of $CP$
violation in the Higgs sector are briefly discussed.

depend on the initial state parton emission, can describe both the observed
rapidity gaps and, in addition, the forward energy flow in an inclusive event
sample.

is included in the self-energies compared to a calculation assuming always
saturation density of nuclear matter. Different approaches are studied: The
main results are calculated with self-energies extracted from a
Dirac-Br\""uckner-Hartree-Fock G-matrix of a one boson exchange model, i.e. the
Bonn potential. These results are compared with those obtained by a
generalization of static Skyrme force, with calculations in the simple linear
Walecka model and results of the Br\""uckner-Hartree-Fock G-matrix of the Reid
soft core potential. The transversal flow is very sensitive to these different
approaches. A comparison with the data is given.

of the original dynamics in which mass it treated as dynamical variable. Here
the classical symmetry group turns out to be given by an $\reals$-extension of
the Galilei group which formerly appeared only at the quantum level. There is
now no obstruction to implement an action of the classical symmetry group on
Hilbert space. We include some critical comments of a general nature on formal
derivations of superselection rules without dynamical context.
