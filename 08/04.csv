a low noise receiver. The axion mass range accessible by this experiment is
1.3-13 micro-eV. The expected sensitivity will be roughly 50 times greater than
achieved by previous experiments in this mass range. The assembly of the

Nova Mus 1991, in quiescence. In each source, we postulate that there is an
outer region, extending outward from about 3000 Schwarzschild radii, where the
accretion flow is in the form of a standard thin disk. The outer disk produces
most of the radiation we observe in the infrared, optical and UV bands. We
propose that the disk undergoes an instability at its inner edge, perhaps by
the mechanism described recently by Meyer \& Meyer-Hofmeister for cataclysmic
variables. The accreting gas is thereby converted into a hot corona which flows
into the black hole as a nearly virial two-temperature flow. We describe the
hot inner flow by means of a recently discovered stable solution of optically
thin advection-dominated accretion. In this flow, most of the thermal energy
released by viscous dissipation is advected into the black hole and only a
small fraction, $\sim10^{-4}-10^{-3}$, of the energy is radiated. The radiation
is in the form of Comptonized synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission, and has
a broad spectrum extending from optical to soft gamma-rays. The models we
present are consistent with all the available data in the three sources. In
particular, the X-ray emission from the hot inner flow fits the observed flux
and spectral index of A0620-00. We derive a mass accretion rate of
$\sim10^{-11}\msyr$ in A0620-00 and Nova Mus, and $\sim{\rm
few}\times10^{-10}\msyr$ in V404 Cyg. The best fit to the data is obtained for
a viscosity parameter $\alpha\sim0.1-0.3$ in the hot flow. The models predict
that all three sources must have substantial flux in hard X-rays and soft
$\gamma$-rays. This prediction is testable in the case of V404 Cyg with current
instruments. A necessary feature of our proposal is that most of the viscous

suited for numerical analysis of structure formation by applying it to seeds
induced by fluctuations of a global scalar field. Our numerical results are
complementary to previous investigations since we use substantially different
methods. The resulting microwave background fluctuations are compatible with
older simulations. We also obtain a scale invariant spectrum of fluctuations
with about the same amplitude. However, our dark matter results yield a smaller
bias parameter compatible with $b\sim 2$ on a scale of $20 Mpc$ in contrast to

any proper theory of quantum gravity must confront: to what extent does the
inclusion of the back-reaction alter the thermal character of the radiation,
how can the entropy be understood from a microscopic standpoint, what is the
ultimate fate of an evaporating black hole, and is the outcome reconcilable
with unitary time evolution in quantum mechanics?
  In the first part of this thesis, we address the issue of determining what
the actual emission spectrum from a black hole is, once the gravitational field
of the emitted quanta is included in a quantum mechanical manner. To make the
problem tractable, we employ two important approximations: we quantize only the
s-wave sector of the full theory, and we consider only single particle
emission. By proceeding in the framework of a Hamiltonian path integral
description of this system, we are able to integrate out the gravitational
field, thereby obtaining an effective action depending only on the matter
degrees of freedom. This effective action can then be second quantized in terms
of new, corrected, mode solutions thus enabling the calculation of the emission
spectrum from modified Bogoliubov coefficients. The results are particularly
interesting in the case of emission from Reissner-Nordstrom black holes, since
in the extremal limit our results are dramatically different from what a naive,
and incorrect, semi-classical calculation would yield.
  The other major topic which we discuss is the dynamics of quantum fields on
background geometries which undergo quantum tunneling. An example of such a
system which has important implications for both cosmology and quantum gravity
in general, is the tunneling of a false vacuum bubble leading to the creation

recent theorem of Eardley by proving that a compact region in an initial data

establishing this stronger result, the geometrical argument used does not
require any asymptotic or energy conditions on the initial data. It follows
that if such a region can be found in an asymptotically flat Cauchy surface of
a spacetime satisfying the null-convergence condition, the spacetime must
contain a black hole with the future trapped region therein. Further, up to
another conjecture, we prove a strengthened version of our theorem by arguing
that if a certain function (defined on the collection of compact subsets of the
initial data surface that are themselves three-dimensional manifolds with
boundary) is not strictly positive, then the initial data surface must contain
a future trapped region. As a byproduct of this work, we offer a slightly
generalized notion of a future trapped region as well as a new proof that
future trapped regions lie within the black hole region.
