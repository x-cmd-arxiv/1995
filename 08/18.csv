that the variability is a consequence of dynamical effects. We also find that
the slope of the cycle-averaged magnetization, d<M>/dH, is correlated with the

regions around neutron stars and black holes. In the case of binary systems,
part of the photons emitted from the companion star towards the collapsed
object are expected to be deflected in the direction of the earth. Based on a
semi-classical approach we calculate the characteristic time delays and
frequency shifts of these photons as a function of the binary orbital phase.
The intensity of the strongly deflected light rays is reduced by many orders of
magnitude, therefore making the observations of this phenomenon extremely
difficult. Relativistic binary systems containing a radio pulsar and a
collapsed object are the best available candidates for the detection of the
strongly deflected photons. Based on the accurate knowledge of their orbital
parameters, these systems allow to predict accurately the delays of the pulses
along the highly deflected path, such that the sensitivity to very weak signals
can be substantially improved through coherent summation over long time
intervals. We discuss in detail the cases of PSR 1913+16 and PSR 1534+12 and
find that the system geometry is far more promising for the latter. The
observation of the highly deflected photons can provide a test of general
relativity in an unprecedented strong field regime as well as a tight
constraint on the radius of the collapsed object.

are dynamically equivalent to the `dominant mode cluster'. The initial binary
orbits are consitent with pre-main sequence data. Stellar masses are paired at
random from the KTG(1.3) mass function. We develop a simple model which
establishes the observed correlations between eccentricity, mass ratio and
period. Stimulated evolution of orbital parameters within the cluster places a
few per cent of all orbits into the eigenevolution region of the eccentricity-
period diagram. Observations should reveal the odd binary with eccentric orbits
at periods smaller than the circularisation cutoff period. We show that the
birth eccentricity distribution must be approximately dynamically relaxed
because stimulated evolution in the dominant mode cluster cannot sufficiently
thermalise a significantly different distribution. After disintegration of the
dominant mode cluster we have a proportion of binaries which compares
favourably with the observed proportion. The shape of the period distribution
agrees well with the observed distribution. The mass-ratio distribution of G
dwarf binaries is depleted at small mass ratios and has the shape of the main
sequence distribution. We predict and tabulate the mass ratio distribution for
main sequence binaries with a primary star less massive than $1.1\,M_\odot$.
Our model Galactic field stellar population has a binary proportion among G-,
K- and M-dwarfs in good agreement with the observational data. Too few triple
and quadruple systems form by capture to account for the number of observed
systems. We compare the specific angular momentum distribution of our initial
