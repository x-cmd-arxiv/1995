parametric instability which leads to the growth of internal waves near the
outer edges of such disks (Goodman 1993). These waves are important in
understanding the torque exerted on a disk by tidal forces and may play a role
in the structure of the disk at small radii. Here we calculate the growth rate
of this instability, including the effects of vertical structure and fluid
compressibility. We find growth rates which are only slightly different from
Goodman's original results, except that near the vertical resonance radius the
growth rate can have an extremely broad and strong peak when the disk is stably
stratified in the vertical direction. Higher order modes, in the sense of
increasing number of vertical nodes, have similar growth rates. Our results
differ from a previous calculation along these lines by Lubow et al. (1993).
The difference is mostly due to their neglect of radial gradients in the
tidally distorted streamlines.

therefore provide an important way of studying the formation and evolution of

from observations of the X-ray emission of the gas in distant clusters, but
interpreting these data is not straightforward. In a simplified view, clusters
grow from perturbations in the matter distribution: their intracluster gas is
compressed and shock-heated by the gravitational collapse$^{1}$. The resulting
X-ray emission is determined by the hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas in the
changing gravitational potential. However, if processes such as radiative
cooling or pre-collapse heating of the gas are important, then the X-ray
evolution will be strongly influenced by the thermal history of the gas. Here
we present the first results from a faint flux-limited sample of X-ray selected
clusters compiled as part of the ROSAT International X-ray and Optical Survey
(RIXOS). Very few distant clusters have been identified. Most importantly,
their redshift distribution appears to be inconsistent with simple models based
on the evolution of the gravitational potential. Our results suggest that
radiative cooling or non-gravitational heating of the intracluster gas must
play an important role in the evolution of clusters.

in the highly-doped material occur well above T_c in the oxygen-reduced

400 cm^{-1}, which becomes more intense at low doping and low temperatures,
borrowing oscillator strength from apical and plane oxygen modes resulting in a
major transformation of the phonon spectrum below approx 150 K.

admittance of a two-dimensional electron gas connected to ideal metallic
contacts and subject to a quantizing magnetic field. In the framework of the
edge-channel picture, we calculate the admittance up to first order with
respect to frequency. The transport coefficients in first order with respect to
frequency, which are called emittances, determine the charge emitted into a
contact of the sample or a gate in response to an oscillating voltage applied
to a contact of the sample or a nearby gate. The emittances depend on the
potential distribution inside the sample which is established in response to
the oscillation of the potential at a contact. We show that the emittances can
be related to the elements of an electro-chemical capacitance matrix which
describes a (fictitious) geometry in which each edge channel is coupled to its
own reservoir. The particular relation of the emittance matrix to this
electro-chemical capacitance matrix depends strongly on the topology of the
edge channels: We show that edge channels which connect different reservoirs
contribute with a negative capacitance to the emittance. For example, while the
emittance of a two-terminal Corbino disc is a capacitance, the emittance of a
two-terminal quantum Hall bar is a negative capacitance. The geometry of the
edge-channel arrangement in a many-terminal setup is reflected by symmetry
properties of the emittance matrix. We investigate the effect of voltage probes
and calculate the longitudinal and the Hall resistances of an ideal
four-terminal Hall bar for low frequencies.

rise to non-zero vacuum expectation values of the scalar neutrinos. This leads
to nonuniversal and flavour-violating tree-level couplings of the W and Z
bosons to charged leptons and neutrinos. The parameter space of this novel
scenario is systematically analyzed and further restricted by a number of
laboratory, astrophysical, and cosmological constraints. The possibility that
our minimal model can account for the KARMEN anomaly is examined.

framework of causal perturbation theory. The most general form of the
interaction which is invariant under operator gauge transformations is pointed
out. The generator of these transformations generally fails to be nilpotent.
This defect, however, is easily cured by including scalar fields in the gauge
transformations. Due to gauge invariance these scalar gauge fields couple to
the Yang-Mills fields with predicted strength. We also show that invariance
under ghost charge conjugation fixes the form of the interaction completely.
The coupling of the Yang-Mills fields and the scalar gauge fields to matter is
investigated. It is proven that gauge invariance implies unitarity of the
physical $S$-matrix. We always work in the Fock space of free quantum fields in
which all expressions are mathematically well defined.

has been transformed from whether or not there are any examples except surfaces
of rotation to one of understanding the structure of the space of examples.

analyzed and the associated contribution to the Gibbs free energy is

phase is considered within the frame of Landau theory of phase transitions. The
volume misfit between the inclusion and matrix is assumed to originate from the
transformation volume change coupled with the phenomenological order parameter.
The minimization of free energy with respect to the volume change and order
parameter gives the dependence of Gibbs energy on the volume fraction of the
product phase. The transformation proceeds in a finite temperature region with
the equilibrium volume fraction dependent on temperature rather than at a fixed
temperature as it would be expected for the first-order transition. The
activation processes are shown to be irrelevant and the transformation kinetics
is found to be fluctuationless.

and functions by quantum circuits, almost all states and functions are
exponentially hard to approximate [Knill 1995]. The bounds obtained are
asymptotically tight except for the one based on total variation distance
(TVD). TVD is the most relevant metric for the performance of a quantum
circuit. In this paper we obtain asymptotically tight bounds for TVD. We show
that in a natural sense, almost all states are hard to approximate to within a
TVD of 2/e-\epsilon even for exponentially small \epsilon. The quantity 2/e is
asymptotically the average distance to the uniform distribution. Almost all
states with probability amplitudes concentrated in a small fraction of the
space are hard to approximate to within a TVD of 2-\epsilon. These results
imply that non-uniform quantum circuit complexity is non-trivial in any
reasonable model. They also reinforce the notion that the relative information
distance between states (which is based on the difficulty of transforming one
state to another) fully reflects the dimensionality of the space of qubits, not
the number of qubits.
