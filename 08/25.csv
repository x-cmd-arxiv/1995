intrinsic variability may be unambiguously separated from the microlensing
variability through parallax measurements from 3 observers when there is no
relative motion of the lens masses (Refsdal 1993). In systems with fewer than 3
resolved images, however, this separation is not straightforward. A general
approach that may be used for this purpose is presented. For simplicity, only
the one-dimensional case is considered in detail: Given a well-sampled time
series of the observed flux at two points in space with a known separation,
choosing a velocity $v_{\perp}$ of the observers perpendicular to the line of
sight determines the microlensing magnification history, and thereby also the
intrinsic variability. The velocity is chosen by minimizing some measure
($\chi^2$) of the residual intrinsic variability. In many cases this gives a
close approximation to the true magnification. In cases where the relative
motion of the lensing point masses is important, only a partial separation will
be possible.

gravitational instability in the framework of cosmological Lagrangian fluid
dynamics of cold dust. They include the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA), the
``non-magnetic'' approximation of Bertschinger \& Jain (1994, NMA), and a new
``local tidal'' approximation (LTA). The LTA is exact for any perturbations
whose gravitational and velocity equipotentials have the same constant shape
with time, including spherical, cylindrical, and plane-parallel perturbations.
We tested all three local approximations with the collapse of a homogeneous
triaxial ellipsoid, for which an exact solution exists for an ellipsoid
embedded in empty space and an excellent approximation is known in the
cosmological context. We find that the LTA is significantly more accurate in
general than the ZA and the NMA. Like the ZA, but unlike the NMA, the LTA
generically leads to pancake collapse. For a randomly chosen mass element in an
Einstein-de Sitter universe, assuming a Gaussian random field of initial
density fluctuations, the LTA predicts that at least 78\% of initially
underdense regions collapse owing to nonlinear effects of shear and tides.

and 3<logP<7.5. We distribute 200 binaries in aggregates with half mass radii R
corresponding to the range from tightly clustered to isolated star formation,

integration. Hardening and softening of binary systems do not significantly
increase the number of orbits with logP<3 and logP>7.5. After the cluster with
R=0.8pc disintegrates we obtain a population which consists of about 60 per
cent binary systems with a period distribution for logP>4 as is observed and in
which the G-dwarf binaries have a mass ratio distribution which agrees with the
observed distribution. This result indicates that the majority of Galactic
field stars may originate from a clustered star formation mode. We invert the
orbit depletion function and obtain an approximation to the initial binary star
period distribution for star formation in the dominant mode cluster. Comparison
with the measured distribution of orbits for pre-main sequence stars suggests
that the initial distribution may not depend on the star formation environment.
Inverse dynamical population synthesis suggests that the Galactic field stellar
mass function may be related to the stellar density at birth in the most
common, or dominant, mode of star formation.

is an approximate global symmetry, which determines the order of magnitude of
Yukawa couplings and scalar VEVs. We assume that the terms violating this
symmetry are suppressed by powers of the small parameter
$\epsilon_{PQ}=O(m_b/m_t)$. The tree-level flavor changing interactions are
small due to a combination of this global symmetry and a flavor symmetry, but
they can be the dominant source of $CP$ violation. All $CP$-violating effects
occur at order $\epsilon_{PQ}^2$ as the result of exchange of {\it

an {\it almost}-real CKM matrix. On dimensional grounds, the model gives

The nonuniformly isospin-orientated solutions are shown to be related to the

pion charge distribution arising from these solutions. The distribution
$dP/df=1/(2\sqrt{f})$ holds for the uniform solutions in general and the
nonuniform solutions in the $1+1$ boost invariant case. For the nonuniform
solution in $1+1$ without a boost-invariance and in higher dimensions, the

the pions selected from a small segment in the momentum phase space. We suggest
that the nonuniform DCC's may correspond to the mini-Centauro events.

The present approach is a field theoretical generalization of the Bogoliubov

formally solving the Gauss equation such that the physical variables are
separated by a non-Abelian projection operator, instead of fixing a gauge. By

correspondence with the relativistic covariance. Gauge symmetry is broken
spontaneously since the gauge invariance of the Hamiltonian is not shared by
the vacuum. The squeezed vacuum in the present model is characterized by one
free parameter related to the contraction of a pair of zero momentum gluon

is accomplished by deriving the unitary operator of adiabatic evolution for the

causes of the problem of phase-mixing, whose effect is the polynomial increase
in time of the perturbation terms normally called secularities, arises from the
shifts of the perturbation energy levels due to the unperturbed part of the

perturb the Bean state by an energy $\Delta\epsilon$. We find that no matter
how small $\Delta\epsilon$ is it will always be able to induce creep somewhere
on the Bean profile. This finding has important consequences for the
interpretation of low temperature creep phenomena in terms of quantum creep.
