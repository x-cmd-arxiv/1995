distribution of dark mass in the Universe. On galactic scales, complementary
techniques include the use of stellar kinematics, kinematics and morphology of
the neutral gas layer, kinematics of satellites, and morphology and temperature
profile of X-ray halos. These methods are compared, with emphasis on their
relative strengths and weaknesses in constraining the distribution and extent
of dark matter in the Milky Way and other galaxies. It is concluded that (1)
the extent of dark halos remains ill-constrained, (2) halos need not be
isothermal, and (3) the dark mass is probably quite flattened.

with projected separations a_p < 150 AU in the Sco-Oph star-forming region.
Combining our observations with published 1300 micron photometry, we find that
binaries in Sco-Oph with 1 < a_p < 50--100 AU have lower submillimeter fluxes
than wider binaries or single stars, as previously found for Taurus- Auriga
binaries. The wide binaries and single stars have indistinguishable
submillimeter flux distributions. Thus, binary companions with separations less
than 50--100 AU significantly influence the nature of associated disks.
  We have explored the hypothesis that the reduction in submillimeter flux is
the result of gaps cleared in disks by companions. Gap clearing produces the
qualitative dependence of submillimeter flux on binary separation, and a simple
model suggests that large gaps in disks with surface densities typical of
wide-binary or single-star disks can reduce submillimeter fluxes to levels
consistent with the observed limits. This model shows that the present
submillimeter flux upper limits do not necessarily imply a large reduction in
disk surface densities.
  Two-thirds of the young binaries were detected by IRAS, showing that most
binaries have circumstellar disks. These fluxes place lower limits of 10^{-5}
M_sun on circumstellar disk masses. The submillimeter fluxes place upper limits
of 0.005 M_sun on circumbinary disk masses. Thus massive circumbinary disks are
rare among binaries with separations between a few AU and 100 AU. Circumbinary
disks are found around some close binaries.

galaxies we consider the distribution of galaxies within the multicolor space
$U$, $B_J$, $R_F$ and $I_N$. We find that they form an almost planar
distribution out to $B_J =22.5$ and $z<0.3$. The position of a galaxy within
this plane is dependent on its redshift, luminosity and spectral type. While in
the original $U$, $B_J$, $R_F$ and $I_N$ space these properties are highly
correlated we can define an optimal rotation of the photometric axes that makes
much of this information orthogonal. Fitting the observed spectroscopic
redshifts with a quadratic function of the four magnitudes we show that
redshifts for galaxies can be estimated to an accuracy better than $\Delta z
=0.05$. This dispersion is due to the photometric uncertainties within the
photographic data. Assuming no galaxy evolution we derive a set of simulated
galaxy fluxes in the U, J, F and N passbands. Using these data we investigate
how the redshift is encoded within the broadband magnitudes and the intrinsic
dispersion of the photometric-redshift relation. We find that the signal that
defines a galaxy's photometric redshift is not related to specific absorption
or emission lines but comes from the break in the overall shape of the galaxy
continuum at around 4000 \AA. Using high signal-to-noise photometric data we
estimate that it is possible to achieve an intrinsic dispersion of less than
$\Delta z =0.02$.

give a characteristic radio spectrum with a spectral index of +1/3 below a

-0.7 above the maximum. We test the proposed concept for consistency with the

is shown that the algebraic structure of the ($p=2$) parastatistical dynamical

oscillator is discussed and its symmetries investigated. It turns out that this

of generators of the symmetries forms the algebra of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics supplemented with an additional central charge. In this sense there
is no relation between the parabose-parafermi supersymmetry and the
parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics. A precise definition of a quantum system
involving this type of parabose- parafermi supersymmetry is offered, thus
introducing ($p=2$) Supersymmetric Paraquantum Mechanics. The spectrum
degeneracy structure of general ($p=2$) supersymmetric paraquantum mechanics is
analyzed in detail. The energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the
parabose-parafermi oscillator are then obtained explicitly. The latter confirms
the validity of the results obtained for general supersymmetric paraquantum

magnetization occurs due to the Gauss' law constraint which connects the charge
condensation to the background magnetic field. It is found that the stable
vacuum with nonzero charge condensation is realized only when fermion masses

suggests that the spontaneous magnetization is closely related to the fermion

earlier treatments can be improved. When the surface is stationary only free
pions emerge. The time-dependent situation is also addressed, as is the
conversion of non-physical (i.e. unperturbed delta-hole) modes to real

insight into the general wave packet behavior and demonstrates agreement with

radial wave packet as a member of a particular family of squeezed states, which

uncertainty in the radial coordinates during the first pass through the outer
