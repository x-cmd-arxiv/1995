lens candidates using the Hubble Space Telescope. We have so far discovered two
good examples of such lenses, each in the form of four faint blue images
located in a symmetric configuration around a red elliptical galaxy. The high
resolution of HST has facilitated the discovery of this optically selected
sample of faint lenses with small (~1 arcsec) separations between the (I ~
25-27) lensed components and the much brighter (I ~ 19-22) lensing galaxies.
The sample has been discovered in the routine processing of HST fields through
the Medium Deep Survey pipeline, which fits simple galaxy models to broad band
filter images of all objects detected in random survey fields using WFPC2.
  We show that the lens configuration can be modeled using the gravitational
field potential of a singular isothermal ellipsoidal mass distribution. With
this model the lensing potential is very similar, both in ellipticity and
orientation, to the observed light distribution of the elliptical galaxy, as
would occur when stars are a tracer population. The model parameters and
associated errors have been derived by 2-dimensional analysis of the observed
images. The maximum likelihood procedure iteratively converges simultaneously
on the model for the lensing elliptical galaxy and the source of the lensed
components. A systematic search is in progress for other gravitational lens
candidates in the HST Medium Deep Survey. This should eventually lead to a good
statistical estimate for lensing probabilities, and enable us to probe the
cosmological component of the observed faint blue galaxy population.

data: the distribution of column densities is fit well by a power law with
exponent beta=1.55 with a possible deficiency of lines above column density
10^{15} cm^{-2}; the integrated distribution matches observed data over a broad
range of column densities 10^{13} to 10^{17} cm^{-2}; a Gaussian statistical
fit to the Doppler parameter distribution yields a median of 35.6 km s^{-1};
the evolution of the number of clouds with column densities larger than 10^{14}
cm^{-2} follows a power law with exponent gamma=2.22. Analogous calculations
are presented for HeII absorption lines and we find the ratio of Doppler
parameters b_{HeII}/b_{HI} = 0.87. Our data also suggests that Ly$\alpha$

clouds which tend to reside in sheets or filamental structures and are very
elongated and/or flattened, and the large column density clouds which are
typically found at the intersections of these caustic structures and are
quasi-spherical.

instability types in stellar systems is pointed out, the first one being well

instability. In bars the third dimension brings essential dynamical effects
which modify the views about the history of bulges and the spiral secular
evolution. Bars may grow, bend, thicken, and dissolve into spheroidal bulges,
and spirals may evolve along the Hubble sequence in the sense Sd$\to$Sa. This
leads to a much more dynamical picture of isolated galaxies than imagined

We use the recent production ratios of the actinide pairs $^{235}$U/$^{238}$U

observed abundance ratios from Anders \& Grevesse (1989) to determine the

maximum likelihood estimates and confidence intervals for the infall parameter,
$\beta$, which controls the growth rate of the disc in our models. We compare
our predictions for the age of the disc with the age of the galaxy estimated
from models of white dwarf cooling and from the age of globular clusters. From
our statistical analysis we find that these three methods of age prediction
appear to be consistent for a range of maximum likelihood values of $\beta$

  version of paper to appear in J. Diff. Geom",,,,"dg-ga math.DG math.SG",,"  In his study of Dirac structures, a notion which includes both Poisson
structures and closed 2-forms, T. Courant introduced a bracket on the direct
sum of vector fields and 1-forms. This bracket does not satisfy the Jacobi
identity except on certain subspaces. In this paper we systematize the
properties of this bracket in the definition of a Courant algebroid. This
structure on a vector bundle $E\rightarrow M$, consists of an antisymmetric
bracket on the sections of $E$ whose ``Jacobi anomaly'' has an explicit
expression in terms of a bundle map $E\rightarrow TM$ and a field of symmetric
bilinear forms on $E$. When $M$ is a point, the definition reduces to that of a
Lie algebra carrying an invariant nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form.
  For any Lie bialgebroid $(A,A^{*})$ over $M$ (a notion defined by Mackenzie
and Xu), there is a natural Courant algebroid structure on $A\oplus A^{*}$
which is the Drinfel'd double of a Lie bialgebra when $M$ is a point.
Conversely, if $A$ and $A^*$ are complementary isotropic subbundles of a
Courant algebroid $E$, closed under the bracket (such a bundle, with dimension
half that of $E$, is called a Dirac structure), there is a natural Lie
bialgebroid structure on $(A,A^{*})$ whose double is isomorphic to $E$. The
theory of Manin triples is thereby extended from Lie algebras to Lie
algebroids.
  Our work gives a new approach to bihamiltonian structures and a new way of
combining two Poisson structures to obtain a third one. We also take some
tentative steps toward generalizing Drinfel'd's theory of Poisson homogeneous
spaces from groups to groupoids.

$E\sim j^{\kappa+1}$, $\kappa\geq0$, is studied numerically. From the solutions
of the nonlinear diffusion equation, the fundamental and higher-order
components of the harmonic susceptibility are obtained. A large portion of the
data for every $\kappa$ can be scaled by a single parameter, $\xi$
=$t^{1/(\kappa+2)}\cdot H_0^{\kappa/(\kappa+2)}/D$, where $t$ is the period of
the ac field at the surface, $H_0$ is its amplitude and $D$ is the slab
thickness. This is, however, only an approximate scaling property: The field
penetration into a nonlinear medium is a more complex phenomenon than in the
linear case. In particular, the susceptibility values are not uniquely defined
by a set of only two parameters, such as $\kappa$ and $\xi$, while one
parameter, i.e. $t^{1/2}$/D, is sufficient to describe the electrodynamic
response of a linear medium.
