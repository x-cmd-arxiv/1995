Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) observations of the infrared loud quasar
IRAS 13349+2438. IRAS 13349+2438 is the archetypal highly-polarized radio-quiet
QSO and has an optical/infrared luminosity of about 2E46 erg/s. We detect
variability in the ROSAT count rate by a factor of 4.1 in about one year, and
there is also evidence for about 25 per cent variability within one week. We
find no evidence for large intrinsic cold absorption of soft X-rays. These two
facts have important consequences for the scattering-plus-transmission model of
this object which was developed to explain its high wavelength-dependent
polarization and other properties. The soft X-ray variability makes electron
scattering of most of the soft X-rays difficult without a very peculiar
scattering mirror. The lack of significant intrinsic cold X-ray absorption
together with the large observed E(B-V) suggests either a very peculiar system
geometry or, more probably, absorption by warm ionized gas with internal dust.
There is evidence for an ionized oxygen edge in the X-ray spectrum. IRAS
13349+2438 has many properties that are similar to those of the Osterbrockian
`narrow-line' Seyfert 1s.

  http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/preprint/PrePrint.html In IAU Symposium 173:
  Astrophysical Applications of Gravitational Lensing.",,,"CAP-9508009","astro-ph",,"  Several macrolensed systems exhibit photometric variability consistent with
microlensing due to objects of stellar mass located in the lens. The degree of
microlensing amplification is dependent upon the size of the source, with
smaller sources being more amplified. In general, amplification of sources
larger than an Einstein radius projected onto the source plane is negligible.
For the quasar Q2237+0305, a quadrupole image lens (Huchra et al., 1985), this
radius is 0.05 pc, larger than the predicted size of a continuum emitting
accretion disk, but substantially smaller than the broad line region (Figure
1). This scale difference implies that the continuum will be amplified while
the broad line emission remains essentially unchanged during a microlensing
event (Sanitt, 1971; Kayser et al., 1986).
  The broad line emitting region, as a whole, is too large to be microlensed,
but substructure on small scales may be significantly amplified. Although the
total flux in the line is relatively unchanged, microlensing of substructure
can result in changes in the shape of the emission line profiles, and produce
measurable shifts in the central wavelength of the line (Nemiroff, 1988;
Schneider and Wambsganss, 1990).

dispersing (Sinai) billiards. They modify the contributions of periodic orbits
(PO's), with at least one segment which is almost tangent to the concave part
of the boundary. Given a wavenumber $k$, all the PO's with length up to the
Heisenberg length $O(k)$ are required for quantization. We show that most of
the contributions of PO's which are longer than a limit $O(k^{2/3})$ must be
corrected for diffraction effects. For orbits which just miss tangency, the
corrections are of the same magnitude as the semiclassical contributions
themselves. Orbits which bounce at extreme forward angles give very small terms
in the standard semiclassical theory. The diffraction corrections increase
their amplitude substantially.

can be given if we adopt generalized $\zeta$-functions to define the quantum

is the dimension $q$ associated with the continuous part of the eigenvalue
spectrum of the Hamiltonian for nonrelativistic systems or the spatial part of
the Klein-Gordon operator for relativistic systems. In either case
Bose-Einstein condensation can only occur if $q\ge3$.
