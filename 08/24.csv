others are six low-density models with the density parameter $\Omega=0.1$, 0.2
or 0.3 and with or without a cosmological constant $\Lambda=1-\Omega$. We find
that the velocity dispersion profiles depend both on $\Omega$ and on $\Lambda$.
For $\Lambda=0$, the profiles are steeper in a lower-$\Omega$ model than in a
higher-$\Omega$ one. The cosmological constant significantly weakens the
dependence on $\Omega$: the difference in the profile distributions between two
flat models is much smaller than that between the two corresponding open models
with the same $\Omega$. These results in principle can be used to constrain the
cosmological parameters when a large sample of the velocity dispersion profiles
is available. Motivated by the practical situation that a sample of $\sim 100$
clusters with $\sim 100$ measured redshifts per cluster is still the best
sample available in the foreseen future, we examine carefully to what degree
the cosmological parameters can be constrained with the velocity dispersion
profiles of such a sample of clusters. The limited sampling around clusters and
the limited number of clusters seriously degrade the discriminative power of
the velocity dispersion profiles among cosmological models. We find that the
five models of $\Omega\ge 0.2$ cannot be distinguished by this type of
observation. Due to the limited sampling, one should be very cautious in
extracting information about the density profile and/or the dynamics around
single clusters from the diluted velocity dispersion profiles

the flavor evolution of neutrino states propagating through a stochastic field
of density fluctuations. We examine the approach to neutrino flavor
depolarization, and study the effects of this phenomenon in both the early
shock reheating epoch and the later r-process nucleosynthesis epoch. Our
results suggest that significant fluctuation-induced neutrino flavor
depolarization effects occur in these environments only when the zero-order
(without density fluctautions) evolution of the neutrino states includes
adiabatic propagation through resonances (mass level crossings). In the shock
reheating epoch, depolarization effects from fluctuations with amplitudes
larger than 0.05% of the local matter density can cause an increase in the
heating rate of the material behind the shock compared to the case with no
neutrino flavor transformation - but this corresponds to a significant decrease
in this quantity relative to the case with adiabatic neutrino transformation.
If r-process nucleosynthesis is to occur during the late stages of supernova
evolution, then the requirement of neutron-rich conditions excludes a region of
neutrino mass-squared difference and vacuum mixing angle ($\delta m^2,\
\sin^22\theta$) parameter space for neutrino flavor transformation. We find
that in the presence of stochastic fluctuations, this excluded region is not
significantly altered even for random fluctuations with an amplitude of 1% of
the local matter density.

compatible' with a field theory if it admits a *-algebra of local observables
for that theory which satisfies a locality condition known as `F-locality'.
Kay's proposal is that, in formulating algebraic quantum field theory on
$(M,g)$, F-locality should be imposed as a necessary condition on the *-algebra
of observables. The spacetimes studied are the 2- and 4-dimensional spacelike
cylinders (Minkowski space quotiented by a timelike translation). Kay has shown
that the 4-dimensional spacelike cylinder is F-quantum compatible with massless
fields. We prove that it is also F-quantum compatible with massive fields and
prove the F-quantum compatibility of the 2-dimensional spacelike cylinder with
both massive and massless fields. In each case, F-quantum compatibility is
proved by constructing a suitable F-local algebra.

and allowance is made for relaxation of the adsorbed species to unsymmetrical
configurations. It is found that for both TiO$_2$ and SnO$_2$ an unsymmetrical
dissociated configuration is the most stable. The symmetrical molecularly
adsorbed configuration is unstable with respect to lowering of symmetry, and is
separated from the fully dissociated configuration by at most a very small
energy barrier. The calculated dissociative adsorption energies for TiO$_2$ and
SnO$_2$ are in reasonable agreement with the results of thermal desorption
experiments. Calculated total and local electronic densities of states for
dissociatively and molecularly adsorbed configurations are presented and their
relation with experimental UPS spectra is discussed.

collisions requires a consideration of the effects of the deformation of the
projectile and target. Our aim here is to show that deformation and orientation
of the colliding nuclei have a very significant effect on the fusion-barrier
height and on the compactness of the touching configuration. To facilitate
discussions of fusion configurations of deformed nuclei, we develop a
classification scheme and introduce a notation convention for these
configurations. We discuss particular deformations and orientations that lead
to compact touching configurations and to fusion-barrier heights that
correspond to fairly low excitation energies of the compound systems. Such
configurations should be the most favorable for producing superheavy elements.
We analyse a few projectile-target combinations whose deformations allow
favorable entrance-channel configurations and whose proton and neutron numbers
lead to compound systems in a part of the superheavy region where alpha
half-lives are calculated to be observable, that is, longer than 1 microsecond.

access to the collective dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. We present an
analytical approximation scheme for these HBT radii which combines the recently

saddle point of the emission function. The method is illustrated for a
longitudinally boost-invariant hydrodynamical model of a heavy ion collision
with freeze-out on a sharp hypersurface. The analytical approximation converges
rapidly to the width of the numerically computed correlation function and
reproduces correctly its exact transverse momentum dependence. However, higher
order corrections within our approximation scheme are essential, and the
previously published lowest order results with simple $m_{\perp}$ scaling
behaviour are quantitatively and qualitatively unreliable.

to the classical algebra. It is shown that the differential calculus on quantum
planes with involution, i.e. if one works in position-momentum realization, can
be mapped on a q-difference calculus on a commutative real space. Although this
calculus leads to an interesting discretization it is proved that it can be
realized by generators of the undeformed algebra and does not posess a proper

stochastic terms into the equations for quantum states, resulting in a proposed
new foundation for an existing alternative quantum theory, primary state
diffusion (PSD). Planck-scale stochastic space-time structure results in
quantum fluctuations, whilst larger-scale curvature is responsible for
gravitational forces. The gravitational field and the quantum fluctuation field
are the same, differing only in scale. The quantum mechanics of small systems,
classical mechanics of large systems and the physics of quantum experiments are
all derived dynamically, without any prior division into classical and quantum
domains, and without any measurement hypothesis. Unlike the earlier derivation
of PSD, the new derivation, based on a stochastic space-time differential
geometry, has essentially no free parameters. However many features of this
structure remain to be determined. The theory is falsifiable in the laboratory,
and critical matter interferometry experiments to distinguish it from ordinary
quantum mechanics may be feasible within the next decade.

can define not only the quantum map of an entire density operator, but can find
an analog to the Poincar\'e map of the individual trajectory. Finally, I argue
the usefulness of this model as an example of quantum dissipative chaos, as
well as of a practical application of the decoherence formalism to an
interesting problem.
