  The content stayed the same",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  This is the expanded text of a series of CIME lectures. We present an
algebro-geometric approach to integrable systems, starting with those which can
be described in terms of spectral curves. The prototype is Hitchin's system on
the cotangent bundle of the moduli space of stable bundles on a curve. A
variant involving meromorphic Higgs bundles specializes to many familiar
systems of mathematics and mechanics, such as the geodesic flow on an ellipsoid
and the elliptic solitons. We then describe some systems in which the spectral
curve is replaced by various higher dimensional analogues: a spectral cover of
an arbitrary variety, a Lagrangian subvariety in an algebraically symplectic
manifold, or a Calabi-Yau manifold. One peculiar feature of the CY system is
that it is integrable analytically, but not algebraically: the Liouville tori
(on which the system is linearized) are the intermediate Jacobians of a family
of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Most of the results concerning these three types of
non-curve-based systems are quite recent. Some of them, as well as the
compatibility between spectral systems and the KP hierarchy, are new, while
other parts of the story are scattered through several recent preprints. As
best we could, we tried to maintain the survey style of this article, starting
with some basic notions in the field and building gradually to the recent
developments.

  http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/preprint/PrePrint.html",,,"CAP-9508001","astro-ph",,"  Boron abundances in A- and B-type stars may be a successful way to track
evolutionary effects in these hot stars. The light elements -- Li, Be, and B --
are tracers of exposure to temperatures more moderate than those in which the
H-burning CN-cycle operates. Thus, any exposure of surface stellar layers to
deeper layers will affect these light element abundances. Li and Be are used in
this role in investigations of evolutionary processes in cool stars, but are
not observable in hotter stars. An investigation of boron, however, is possible
through the B II 1362=C5 resonance line.
  We have gathered high resolution spectra from the IUE database of A- and
B-type stars near 10~M$_\odot$ for which nitrogen abundances have been
determined (by Gies & Lambert, 1992, and Venn 1995). The B II 1362=C5 line is
blended throughout the temperature range of this program, requiring spectrum
syntheses to recover the boron abundances. For no star could we synthesize the
1362=C5 region using the meteoritic/solar boron abundance of log(B) =3D 2.88
(Anders & Grevesse 1989); a lower boron abundance was necessary which may
reflect evolutionary effects (e.g., mass loss or mixing near the
main-sequence), the natal composition of the star forming regions, or a
systematic error in the analyses (e.g., non-LTE effects). Regardless of the
initial boron abundance, and despite the possibility of non-LTE effects, it
seems clear that boron is severely depleted in some stars. It may be that the
nitrogen and boron abundances are anticorrelated, as would be expected from
mixing between the H-burning and outer stellar layers. If, as we suspect, a
residue of boron is present in the A-type supergiants, we may exclude a
scenario in which mixing occurs continuously between the surface and the deep

background anisotropy from an extremely large scale adiabatic density
perturbation, on the standard hypothesis that this perturbation is a typical
realization of a homogeneous Gaussian random field. We analyze this effect in
open universes, corresponding to density parameter $\Omega_0<1$ with no
cosmological constant, and concentrate on the recently discussed
super-curvature modes. The effect is present in all of the low multipoles of
the anisotropy, in contrast with the $\Omega_0=1$ case where only the
quadrupole receives a contribution. However, for no value of $\Omega_0$ can a
very large scale perturbation generate a spectrum capable of matching
observations across a wide range of multipoles. We evaluate the magnitude of
the effect coming from a given wavenumber as a function of the magnitude of the
density perturbation, conveniently specified by the mean-square curvature
perturbation. From the absence of the effect at the observed level, we find
that for $0.25\leq\Omega_0\leq 0.8$, a curvature perturbation of order unity is
permitted only for inverse wavenumbers more than one thousand times the size of
the observable universe. As $\Omega_0$ tends to one, the constraint weakens to
the flat space result that the inverse wavenumber be more than a hundred times
the size of the observable universe, whereas for $\Omega_0 < 0.25$ it becomes
stronger. We explain the physical meaning of these results, by relating them to
the correlation length of the perturbation. Finally, in an Appendix we consider
the dipole anisotropy and show that it always leads to weaker constraints.

structure in the wind from a rotating O star, together with resulting synthetic
line profiles showing discrete absorption components (DACs). An azimuthal
variation is induced by a local increase or decrease in the radiative driving
force, as would arise from a bright or dark ``star spot'' in the equatorial
plane. Since much of the emergent wind structure seems independent of the exact
method of perturbation, we expect similar morphology in winds perturbed by
localized magnetic fields or nonradial pulsations, as well as by either
rotationally-modulated structure or transient mass ejections. We find that
bright spots with enhanced driving generate high-density, low-speed streams,
while dark spots generate low-density, high-speed streams. Corotating
interaction regions (CIRs) form where fast material collides with slow material
-- e.g. at the leading (trailing) edge of a stream from a dark (bright) spot,
often steepening into shocks. The unperturbed supersonic wind obliquely impacts
the high-density CIR and sends back a nonlinear signal which takes the form of
a sharp propagating discontinuity (``kink'' or ``plateau'') in the radial
velocity gradient. These features travel inward in the co-moving frame at the
radiative-acoustic characteristic speed, and thus slowly outward in the star's
frame. We find that these slow kinks, rather than the CIRs themselves, are more
likely to result in high-opacity DACs in the absorption troughs of unsaturated
P Cygni line profiles.

the optical isophotes (ellipticity $\sim 0.43$). The spectrum is poorly
constrained by the PSPC data and cannot rule out sizeable radial temperature
gradients or an emission component due to discrete sources equal in magnitude
to the hot gas. Using (and clarifying) the ""geometric test"" for dark matter, we
determined that the hypothesis that mass-traces-light is not consistent with
the X-ray data at 68% confidence and marginally consistent at 90% confidence
independent of the gas temperature profile. Detailed modeling gives constraints
on the ellipticity of the underlying mass of \epsilon_{mass} = 0.47 - 0.72

to total blue mass-to-light ratio \Upsilon_B = (31.9 - 143) \Upsilon_{\sun}.
Similar results are obtained when the dark matter is fit directly using the
known distributions of the stars and gas. When possible rotation of the gas and
emission from discrete sources are included flattened mass distributions are
still required, although the constraints on $\epsilon_{mass}$, but not the
total mass, are substantially weakened.

universal values previously predicted for infinite homogeneous samples. This
effect is expected to occur for the conductivity peaks measured in standard
experimental geometries such as the Hall bar and the Corbino disc. At the
lowest temperatures, the decrease in $\sigma_{xx}^{\rm max}(T)$ is found to
saturate at values proportional to the difference between the adjacent plateaus
in $\sigma_{xy}$, with a prefactor which depends on the particular realization
of disorder in the sample. We argue that this provides a possible explanation
of the ``non-universal scaling'' of $\sigma_{xx}^{\rm max}$ observed in a
number of experiments. We also predict an enhancement of the ``non-local''
resistance due to the macroscopic inhomogeneities. We argue that, in the Hall
bar with a sharp edge, the enhanced ``non-local'' resistance and the size
corrections to the ``local'' resistance $R_{xx}$ are directly related. Using
this relation, we suggest a method by which the finite-size corrections may be
eliminated from $R_{xx}$ and $R_{xy}$ in this case.

these uncertainties are expected to be of the same order as those arising
through electroweak penguins in the standard Gronau-London-method in which
$\alpha$ is extracted by means of isospin relations among $B\to\pi\pi$ decay
amplitudes. Therefore our approach, which does not involve the experimentally
difficult mode $B_d\to\pi^0\pi^0$ and is essentially unaffected by electroweak
penguins, may be an interesting alternative to determine $\alpha$.
