observed with HST, with the large-scale distribution of galaxies determined
from pencil-beam redshift surveys. We estimate the amount of observational data
required from catalogues of Lyman alpha absorbers and galaxies to allow a
statistically significant test of the association of absorbers with large-scale

must be obtained for at least 18 galaxies brighter than Mb=-18 and having
redshifts between 0.2 and 0.4. Based on the redshift surveys used in this

intrinsically uncorrelated with galaxies, we find that 8 lines-of-sight must be
observed to show that the distributions are different at the 95% confidence

bulge, and a dark halo consisting of both MACHOs and cold dark matter with each
component being described by several observationally motivated parameters. We
pare down an initial model space of millions of galactic models to viable
models, those which are consistent with the observational data, including
rotation curve, local projected mass density, and microlensing rates toward the
LMC and bulge. On the basis of a conservative, minimal set of observational
constraints an all-MACHO halo cannot yet be excluded, although in most viable
models of the Galaxy the halo MACHO fraction is between 0\% and 30\%,
consistent with expectations for a universe whose primary component is cold
dark matter. An all-MACHO halo is required to be light, and when data on the
local escape velocity and satellite-galaxy proper motions, which probe the
extent of the dark halo, are taken into account, models which have a high MACHO
mass fraction are ruled out. We also explore the possibility that there are no
MACHOs in the halo. Finally, we point out several important tests that could
definitively exclude an all-MACHO e.g., optical depth for microlensing which is

self-gravitating disks, halos, and, sometimes, bulges. Pairs of galaxies merge
from orbits that initially have zero--energy. The systems that produce multiple
merger remnants are dense, six--member groups in virial equilibrium with low
velocity dispersions. Multiple and pair mergers produce remnants which differ
in both their spatial and kinematic properties. Multiple merger remnants have
small triaxialities and are most likely to appear nearly round from most
viewing angles. They possess cores, with sizes of a few tenths of an effective
radius, that are more extended than pair remnant cores, even when bulges are
included in the progenitors. In multiple mergers, the spin of all components --
halo, disk, and bulge -- increases and, while velocity dispersion dominates in
the central regions, $v_r/\sigma \approx 1$ outside an effective radius in some
projections. The angular momentum and minor axis vectors are aligned for
multiple merger remnants. During merging of multiple progenitors, about half of
the orbital angular momentum in each luminous component is converted into
internal rotation in that component. Material is prevented from accumulating in
the center of multiple merger remnants as efficiently as it does in pair
mergers. In pair mergers that include gas, unrealistically steep surface
brightness profiles have been produced in center of the remnants; in multiple
mergers the formation of overdense nuclei may be impeded, thus allowing more

produced, with particular emphasis on the possibility of reconstructing the
inflaton potential from observations. The spectra provide a potentially
powerful test of the inflationary hypothesis; they are not independent but
instead are linked by consistency relations reflecting their origin from a
single inflationary potential. To lowest-order in a perturbation expansion
there is a single, now familiar, relation between the tensor spectral index and
the relative amplitude of the spectra. We demonstrate that there is an infinite
hierarchy of such consistency equations, though observational difficulties
suggest only the first is ever likely to be useful. We also note that since
observations are expected to yield much better information on the scalars than
on the tensors, it is likely to be the next-order version of this consistency
equation which will be appropriate, not the lowest-order one. If inflation
passes the consistency test, one can then confidently use the remaining
observational information to constrain the inflationary potential, and we
survey the general perturbative scheme for carrying out this procedure.
Explicit expressions valid to next-lowest order in the expansion are presented.
We then briefly assess the prospects for future observations reaching the
quality required, and consider a simulated data set that is motivated by this
outlook.

quantum dynamics operator equations of motion agree with those obtained from
$H$ in the Heisenberg picture by using canonical commutation relations. The
remainder of the paper is devoted to a study of how an effective canonical
algebra can arise, without this condition simply being imposed by fiat on the
operator initial values. We first show that for any total trace Hamiltonian
which involves no noncommutative constants, there is a conserved
anti--self--adjoint operator $\tilde C$ with a structure which is closely
related to the canonical commutator algebra. We study the canonical
transformations of generalized quantum dynamics, and show that $\tilde C$ is a
canonical invariant, as is the operator phase space volume element. The latter
result is a generalization of Liouville's theorem, and permits the application
of statistical mechanical methods to determine the canonical ensemble governing
the equilibrium distribution of operator initial values. We give arguments
based on a Ward identity analogous to the equipartition theorem of classical
statistical mechanics, suggesting that statistical ensemble averages of Weyl
ordered polynomials in the operator phase space variables correspond to the
Wightman functions of a unitary complex quantum mechanics, with a conserved
operator Hamiltonian and with the standard canonical commutation relations
obeyed by Weyl ordered operator strings. Thus there is a well--defined sense in

non-simply connected configuration-spaces. The fundamental group is assumed to
be finite. We analyze in full detail those ambiguities in the quantization
procedure that arise from the non-simply connectedness of the classical
configuration space. We define the quantum theory on the universal cover but
restrict the algebra of observables $\O$ to the commutant of the algebra
generated by deck-transformations. We apply standard superselection principles
and construct the corresponding sectors. We emphasize the relevance of all
sectors and not just the abelian ones.

is capable of significantly concentrating amplitude into solutions for some NP
search problems, on average. This is done by exploiting the same aspects of
problem structure as used by classical backtrack methods to avoid unproductive
search choices. This quantum algorithm is much more likely to find solutions
than the simple direct use of quantum parallelism. Furthermore, empirical
evaluation on small problems shows this quantum algorithm displays the same
phase transition behavior, and at the same location, as seen in many previously
studied classical search methods. Specifically, difficult problem instances are
concentrated near the abrupt change from underconstrained to overconstrained
problems.

  Systems","35 pages, Latex",,,"CPT-95/P.3216","quant-ph",,"  The singular limit $\eps\ra 0$ of the $S$-matrix associated with the equation
$i\eps d\psi(t)/dt=H(t)\psi(t)$ is considered, where the analytic generator
$H(t)\in M_n(\C)$ is such that its spectrum is real and non-degenerate for all
$t\in\R$. Sufficient conditions allowing to compute asymptotic formulas for the
exponentially small off-diagonal elements of the $S$-matrix as $\eps\ra 0$ are
explicited and a wide class of generators for which these conditions are
verified is defined. These generators are obtained by means of generators whose
spectrum exhibits eigenvalue crossings which are perturbed in such a way that
these crossings turn to avoided crossings. The exponentially small asymptotic
formulas which are derived are shown to be valid up to exponentially small
relative error, by means of a joint application of the complex WKB method
together with superasymptotic renormalization. The application of these results
to the study of quantum adiabatic transitions in the time dependent
Schr\""odinger equation and of the semiclassical scattering properties of the
multichannel stationary Schr\""odinger equation closes this paper. The results
presented here are a generalization to $n$-level systems, $n\geq 2$, of results
previously known for $2$-level systems only.
