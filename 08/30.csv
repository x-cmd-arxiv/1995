NGC 1068 made with the BIMA interferometer. Several features appear in the CO
map which have not previously been observed: (1) a firm detection of CO line
emission from a compact region centered on the nucleus of the galaxy; (2) the
detection of a triplet velocity structure characteristic of kinematically
independent regions shown on the spectrum of the unresolved nuclear emission ;
and (3) the detection of a molecular bar, the extent and position angle of
which are in good agreement with the 2 $\mu$m stellar bar. The most intense CO
emission is nonnuclear; the structure and kinematics of this emission imply
that this gas is distributed along the inner spiral arms and not in a ring. The
bar's kinematic influence on the molecular gas in the spiral arms is modest,
with typical ordered noncircular motions of \la\ 30 \kms\ in the plane of the
galaxy. Interior to the spiral arms, the bar's influence is more dramatic, as
reflected by the twisted isovelocity contours in the CO and HCN velocity
fields. The surface density of molecular gas within the central 100 pc radius
of NGC 1068 is the same as that in the central 200 pc radius in the Milky Way
to within the uncertainties. There is evidence for an $m= 1$ kinematic mode in
NGC 1068; we find the kinematic center of rotation to be displaced from the
radio continuum center by about 2.9"", or 200 pc. The HCN image, in contrast to
the CO map, shows a strong concentration of emission centered on the nucleus.
The ratio of integrated intensities of the HCN emission to that of CO is about
0.6 and is the highest ratio measured in the central region of any galaxy.

vary widely, from extremely populous systems like that of UGC 9799, the

to the existence of a population of globular clusters that are not bound to

stripped debris from galaxy interactions and mergers, or alternatively they may
have formed in situ in some scenarios of globular cluster formation.

of the void probability distribution function.
  As functions of ${\bar \xi}_2$, the quantities $S_Q$, $3 \leq Q \leq 5$,
exhibit two plateaus separated by a smooth transition around ${\bar \xi}_2 \sim
1$. In the weakly nonlinear regime, ${\bar \xi}_2 \la 1$, the results are in
reasonable agreement with the predictions of perturbation theory. In the
nonlinear regime, ${\bar \xi}_2 > 1$, the function $S_Q({\bar \xi}_2)$ is
larger than in the weakly nonlinear regime, and increasingly so with $-n$. It
is well-fitted by the expression $S_Q= ({\bar \xi}_2/100)^{0.045(Q-2)}\
{\widetilde S}_Q$ for all $n$. This weak dependence on scale proves {\em a
small, but significant departure from the stable clustering predictions} at
least for $n=0$ and $n=+1$. The analysis of $P_0$ confirms that the expected
scale-invariance of the functions $S_Q$ is not exactly attained in the part of

viscous drag force acting on a moving 2D vortex is shown to depend strongly on
the conductivity of normal metal layers. For a tilted vortex line consisting of
2D vortices the equation of viscous motion in the presence of a transport
current parallel to the layers is obtained. The specific structure of the
vortex line core leads to a new dynamic behavior and to substantial deviations
from the Bardeen-Stephen theory. The viscosity coefficient is found to depend
essentially on the angle $\gamma$ between the magnetic field ${\bf B}$ and the
${\bf c}$ axis normal to the layers. For field orientations close to the layers
the nonlinear effects in the vortex motion appear even for slowly moving vortex
lines (when the in-plane transport current is much smaller than the

shift in the current phase relation for all bonds, resulting in an XY
antiferromagnet. This corresponds to the order-from-disorder selected
highly-degenerate coplanar state of the more extensively studied Heisenberg
Kagome antiferromagnet. Using an histogram Monte-Carlo analysis, we observe a
phase transition at 0.078 of the coupling energy. We find that the jump in the
superfluid density at the transition temperature, determined from a finite-size
scaling analysis of the magnetization fluctuations, retains its universal value
within the Kosterlitz-Thouless scenario despite the well-known degeneracy of
the low-temperature phase. This universal jump, combined with the dramatically
suppressed transition temperature, point to a very strong renormalization of
the spin stiffness just below the transition temperature. We also observe a
sequence of ground states corresponding to flux quanta per elementary triangle
of 1/2, 3/8, 1/4, 1/8, and 0 that, unlike ground states of other lattices,
consist of currents of equal magnitude circulating around each elementary

corresponding to the connection one-forms. The derivatives of the Lagrangian
with respect to the latter class of multivelocities give rise to a set of
multimomenta which naturally occur in the constraint equations. Interestingly,
all the constraint equations of general relativity are linear in terms of this
class of multimomenta. This construction has been then extended to complex
general relativity, where Lorentzian space-time is replaced by a
four-complex-dimensional complex-Riemannian manifold. One then finds a
holomorphic theory where the familiar constraint equations are replaced by a
set of equations linear in the holomorphic multimomenta, providing such
multimomenta vanish on a family of two-complex-dimensional surfaces. In quantum
gravity, the problem arises to quantize a real or a holomorphic theory on the

Universality of Yukawa coupling of superfields is assumed. The resulting
texture of mass matrices in the low energy region depends only on a single
coupling constant and VEVs caused by necessary symmetry breaking. 13 parameters
involving masses and mixing angles in the quark and charged lepton sector are
successfully described by only five parameters with two of them determined by
the scales of U(1), SO(10) and SU(5) symmetry breaking compatible with the
requirement of grand unification and proton decay. The neutrino masses and
mixing angles in the leptonic sector are also determined with the addition of a
Majorana coupling term. It is found that LSND $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}\rightarrow

hot dark matter can be naturally explained. Solar neutrino puzzle can be solved
only by introducing sterile neutrino with one additional parameter. More
precise measurements of $\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})$, $V_{cb}$, $V_{ub}/V_{cb}$,

new non-linear Dirac-like equation (NDE). We want to readdress in this Review
the whole subject, and extend it, by translating it however into the ordinary
tensorial language, within the frame of the first quantization formalism. In
particular, we re-derive here the NDE for the electron field, and show it to be
associated with a new conserved probability current (which allows us to work
out a quantum probabilistic interpretation of our NDE). Actually, the Dirac
equation is obtained from the former NDE just by averaging over a zbw cycle. We
then derive an equation of motion for the 4-velocity field which will allow us
to regard the electron as an extended-type object with a classically
intelligible internal structure. We carefully study the solutions of the NDE;
with special attention to those implying (at the classical limit) light-like
helical motions, which appear to be the most adequate solutions for the
electron description from a kinematical and physical point of view, and do cope
with the electromagnetic properties of the electron. At last we propose a
natural generalization of our approach, for the case in which an external
