of 43.3 GHz ($\lambda$ = 7 mm) continuum emission. The 43 GHz flux density lies
on the same power-law slope defined by 89 to 232 GHz measurements, F$_\nu$
$\propto \nu^{\alpha}$ with index $\alpha$ = 2.39$\pm$0.23, confirming that the
43.3 GHz emission is thermal radiation from circumstellar dust. Upper limits to
the flux densities at 8.4 and 22.5 GHz constrain the contribution of free-free
emission from a compact ionized wind to less than 49\%. The dust emissivity
index, $\beta$, is $0.39\pm$0.23, if the emission is optically thin. Fitting a
model of a thin circumstellar disk to the observed spectral energy distribution
gives $\beta = 0.6\pm0.3$, consistent with the power-law derivation. Both
values are substantially lower than is generally accepted for the interstellar
medium, suggesting grain growth. Given the youth of DO Tau and the early
evolutionary state of its circumstellar disk, this result implies that mm-size
grains have already formed by the early T-Tauri phase.

cosmology is studied, with application to the one-loop prefactor in the quantum
amplitude. Our background cosmological model is flat Euclidean space bounded by
a three-sphere, and our calculations are based on the generalized Riemann
zeta-function. One possible set of supersymmetric local boundary conditions
involves field strengths for spins 1, 3/2 and 2, the undifferentiated spin-1/2
field, and a mixture of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions for spin 0. In this
case the results we can obtain are: zeta(0)=7/45 for a complex scalar field,
zeta(0)=11/360 for spin 1/2, zeta(0)= -77/180 (magnetic) and 13/180 (electric)
for spin 1, and zeta(0)=112/45 for pure gravity when the linearized magnetic
curvature is vanishing on $S^3$. The zeta(0) values for gauge fields have been
obtained by working only with physical degrees of freedom. An alternative set
of boundary conditions can be motivated by studying transformation properties
under local supersymmetry; these involve Dirichlet conditions for the spin-2
and spin-1 fields, a mixture of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions for spin-0,
and local boundary conditions for the spin-1/2 field and the spin-3/2
potential. For the latter one finds: zeta(0)=-289/360. The full zeta(0) does
not vanish in extended supergravity theories, indicating that supersymmetry is
one-loop divergent in the presence of boundaries.

sector of gauge fields suffers from an inherent ambiguity. The popular
Osterwalder-Schrader (OS) recipe for the conjugate Dirac field leads to the
option of a vanishing determinant. We propose a novel representation for the
conjugate field which depends linearly on the Dirac field and yields a
nonvanishing determinant in the nontrivial sector. Physics, it appears, chooses
this second option becuase the novel representation leads to a satisfactory
resolution of two outstanding problems, the strong CP and U(1) problems,
attributed to instanton effects.

for neutral scalar mesons interacting with bi-local sources. These relations
are used as the basis of a method for representing the effect of interactions
in the Gaussian approximation to field theory, and it is argued that a marked
inhomogeneity, in space-time dependence of the sources, forces a discrete
spectrum on the field. The development of such a system is characterized by
features commonly associated with chaos and self-organization (localization by
domain or cell formation). The Green functions play the role of an iterative
map in phase space. Stable systems reside at the fixed points of the map. The
present work can be applied to self-interacting theories by choosing suitable
properties for the sources. Rapid transport leads to a second order phase
transition and anomalous dispersion. Finally, it is shown that there is a
compact representation of the non-equilibrium dynamics in terms of generalized
chemical potentials, or equivalently as a pseudo-gauge theory, with an
imaginary charge. This analogy shows, more clearly, how dissipation and entropy
production are related to the source picture and transform a flip-flop like
behaviour between two reservoirs into the Landau problem in a constant
`magnetic field'. A summary of conventions and formalism is provided as a basis
for future work.

to investigate a generic classical Hamiltonian system. In particular, we show
that Floer's instanton equation is related to a functional Euler character in
the quantum cohomology defined by the topological nonlinear $\sigma$--model.
This relation is an infinite dimensional analog of the relation between
Poincar\'e--Hopf and Gauss--Bonnet--Chern formul\ae$~$ in classical Morse
theory, and can also be viewed as a loop space generalization of the Lefschetz
fixed point theorem. By applying localization techniques to path integrals we
then show that for a K\""ahler manifold our functional Euler character coincides
with the Euler character determined by the finite dimensional de Rham
cohomology of the phase space. Our results are consistent with the Arnold
conjecture which estimates periodic solutions to classical Hamilton's equations
in terms of de Rham cohomology of the phase space.

existence offhand. In the first section we prove that simple theories (e.g.,
theories without the tree property, a class properly containing the stable
theories) behaves ``better'' than theories with the strict order property, by
criterion from [Sh:457]. In the second section we introduce properties SOP_n
such that the strict order property implies SOP_{n+1}, which implies SOP_n,
which in turn implies the tree property. Now SOP_4 already implies
non-existence of universal models in cases where earlier the strict order
property was needed, and SOP_3 implies maximality in the Keisler order, again
improving an earlier result which had used the strict order property.

pseudopotential calculations is described in detail. The method is based on a
formulation of density functional theory in which the ground state energy is
determined by minimization with respect to the density matrix, subject to the
condition that the eigenvalues of the latter lie in the range [0,1].
Linear-scaling behavior is achieved by requiring that the density matrix should
vanish when the separation of its arguments exceeds a chosen cutoff. The
limitation on the eigenvalue range is imposed by the method of Li, Nunes and
Vanderbilt. The scheme is implemented by calculating all terms in the energy on
a uniform real-space grid, and minimization is performed using the
conjugate-gradient method. Tests on a 512-atom Si system show that the total
energy converges rapidly as the range of the density matrix is increased. A
discussion of the relation between the present method and other linear-scaling
methods is given, and some problems that still require solution are indicated.
