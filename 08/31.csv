extension of the method which we introduced in a previous paper. The method is
based on an estimate of the probability density underlying a data sample. The

used kernels have spherical symmetry, however we describe a method in order to
estimate the locally optimal shape of the kernels. We use the results of the
geometrical structure analysis in order to study the effects that is has on the
cluster parameter estimate. This suggests a possible way to distinguish between
structure and substructure within a sample. The method is tested by using
simulated numerical models and applied to two galaxy samples taken from the
literature. The results obtained for the Coma cluster suggest a core-halo
structure formed by a large number of geometrically independent systems. A
different conclusion is suggested by the results for the Cancer cluster
indicating the presence of at least two independent structures both containing
substructure. The dynamical consequences of the results obtained from the
geometrical analysis will be described in a later paper. Further applications
of the method are suggested and are currently in progress.

because the mass initially associated to the individual galaxies is soon
tidally stripped. Stripping is particularly effective for infalling galaxies,
which thus avoid merging. We find that, as a rule, merging is effectively
terminated when infall becomes dominant. We look for compact groups in our
ensemble of simulations, and compare their statistical properties with
Hickson's compact groups. We then discuss in terms of the Press & Schechter
formalism the statistics of such groups and their evolution in different
cosmological scenarios. We show that compact group formation is an ongoing and
frequent process in a critical universe. Our model reconciles the contradiction
between the observed absence of young merger remnants and the high rate of
galaxy interactions expected in compact groups. In open universes, instead,
earlier formation of groups and suppression of secondary infall makes it more
unlikely that compact groups survive as such until the present. We conclude
that the existence of dense and dynamically young groups of galaxies like HCGs
points towards a high-density universe.

processes in QCD, one can study, in principle, the diffractive production of
the Standard Model Higgs boson at LHC using only, as input, $ep$ diffractive
hard-processes data of the type recently collected and analyzed by the H1 and
ZEUS collaborations at HERA. While waiting for a more precise and complete set
of data, we combine here the existing data with a simple Pomeron-exchange
picture and find a large spread in the Higgs boson production cross section,
depending on the input parametrization of the Pomeron's parton content. In
particular, if the Pomeron gluon density $f_{g/P}(\beta)$ is peaked at large
$\beta$ for small scales, single diffractive events will represent a sizeable
fraction of all produced Higgs bosons with an expected better-than-average
signal-to-background ratio.
