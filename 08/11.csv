investigated using the Zebiak and Cane ENSO prediction model. The most dominant
seasonal effect is found to be due to the wind divergence field, as determined
by the seasonal motion of the ITCZ, through its effect on the atmospheric
heating. The next order seasonal effects are due to the seasonality of the
background SST and ocean upwelling velocity, and the corresponding mechanisms
are analyzed. It is suggested that the seasonal forcing has a first order
effect on ENSO's dynamics. Important aspects of the seasonal forcing may be
included in idealized delayed oscillator ENSO models by making the model
background seasonally shift from stable to unstable states.

various separations through a single population of absorbers, four tests have
been designed to diagnose absorber mass distributions (smoothly varying with
radius or irregular), geometries (spherical or disk/slab--like), and kinematics
(isotropic or systematic velocities). Applying the tests to existing data at
redshifts around two we find that: (1) The observed neutral hydrogen column
density (N(HI)) distributions of Lyman-alpha lines coincident to both LOS are
consistent with a smooth mass distribution. (2) Observed large anticoincident
N(HI) are not consistent with a single population of smooth spherical
absorbers, which should exhibit sharp cut--offs at small N(HI) in the N(HI)
distribution. (3) There is marginal evidence that the observed RMS value of
velocity differences between coincident lines increases with DLOS separation as
is expected for disk/slab--like absorbers that have systematic velocity fields.
(4) The observed velocity dispersion along a single LOS is small compared to
the RMS difference between widely separated LOS, which is not consistent with
models of cloudlets moving isotropically within a spherical structure. Overall,
only a smooth disk/slab--like model with systematic velocities remains
consistent with the inferred properties of a single population of Lyman-alpha
absorbers.

Arnowitt-Deser-Misner variables, as a canonical coordinate. In this paper we

dimensional supergravity compactified on a particular Joyce manifold, $J$. In
particular, $J$ is constructed from resolving fixed point singularities of
orbifolds of the seven torus in such a way that one is forced to consider a
generalised orbifold on the heterotic side. We conjecture that a heterotic dual
exists for all the compact 7-manifolds of $G_{2}$ holonomy constructed by
Joyce.

the effective action which generates the sum of tree diagrams with external

scalar particles by $n$ initial particles. The leading contributions to the
tree amplitude, which become singular in the threshold limit, exhibit a
factorial growth with n.

model is based on meson exchange, and involves nucleon and delta--isobar pole
and crossed--pole terms together with correlated $\pi\pi$--exchange in the
$J^P=0^+$ ($\sigma$) and $1^-$ ($\rho$) channel. The results are very similar
for $\pi NN$ and $\pi N\Delta$ and can be roughly parametrized by a monopole
with cutoff mass $>$ 500 MeV, with some variation due to model dependencies.
Thus the formfactors are much less soft than derived before for the $\pi NN$
case by Saito and Afnan using the same procedure but different $\pi N$
interaction models.

substantial effects: In the pionic channel it counterbalances the suppression

about 1 GeV; in the $\omega$-channel it provides nearly half of the empirical
repulsion, leaving little room for explicit quark-gluon effects.

additionally that the higher energy, relativistic, solutions require an

can exist in a potential that grows linearly with r. These are purely
