bursts by calculating the spatial distribution of neutron stars born with high
velocities in the Galactic disk, and comparing the resulting brightness and
angular distribution with the BATSE data. We find that the Galactic halo model
can reproduce the BATSE peak flux and angular distribution data for neutron
star kick velocities $\simgreat 800$~\kms, source turn-on ages $\simgreat
10$~Myrs, and sampling depths $100{\rm~kpc}\simless d_{max} \simless 400$~kpc.

quasars. Quasars from one sample are projected on the sky within 1 degree of a
rich foreground Abell cluster of galaxies, while quasars from the other sample
are more than 3 degrees from any such cluster . There is no significant
difference between the color distributions of the two samples. The 90\% upper
limit on the relative reddening between the two samples is E(B-V)=0.05 mag.
This result limits the allowed quantity of smoothly distributed dust in rich
clusters, and contradicts previous indications for the existence of such a
component.

sigma-models without isotropy. In particular, the jacobian is calculated to
give the known results. The global aspects of the abelian case as well as some
of those of the cases where the isometry group is simply connected are
considered.
  Considering the anomalous case, we infer by a consistency argument that the
`multiplicative anomaly' should be replaceable by adequate rules for
factorization of composite jacobians. These rules are then generalized in a
simple way for composite jacobians defined in spaces of different types.
Implimentation of these rules then gives specific formulas for the anomally for
semisimple algebras and also for solvable ones.

analyzed in the framework of the quasi-classical Eilenberger equations. If the
pairing interaction contains an $s$-wave ($d_{xy}$-wave) component in addition
to a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave component, the $s$-wave ($d_{xy}$-wave) component of
the order parameter is necessarily induced around a vortex in
$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductors. The spatial distribution of the induced
$s$-wave and $d_{xy}$-wave components is calculated. The $s$-wave component has
opposite winding number around vortex near the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-vortex core and
its amplitude has the shape of a four-lobe clover. The amplitude of
$d_{xy}$-component has the shape of an octofoil. These are consistent with
results based on the GL theory.
