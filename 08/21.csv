telescopes equipped with 2K CCD's have been used for this project. The
astrometric properties of these instruments are investigated in detail. New
techniques of using wide field CCD observations for astrometry in general are
developed. An internal precision of 5 to 31 mas in position per single exposure
is found, depending on the brightness of the object. The tie to the primary
optical reference system is established by photographic astrometry using
dedicated astrographs on both hemispheres. An accuracy of $\approx 30$ mas per
source is estimated for the multi--step reduction procedure when based on the
future Hipparcos catalog, while the FK5--based positions suffer from system
errors of 100 to 200 mas as compared to the radio positions. This work provides
a contribution to the international effort to link the Hipparcos instrumental

radio and optical astrometry of a large sample of compact extragalactic sources
will also contribute to the astrophysics of these objects by comparing the

discussed in terms of a possible Jahn-Teller effect, a possible Davydov

and a mixing of the nearly degenerate T_1g and G_g free molecule states because
of the lower symmetry in the solid. The exciton band structure is calculated
with a charge transfer mediated propagation mechanism as suggested by Lof et
