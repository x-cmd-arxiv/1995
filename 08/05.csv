  for publication in the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/176779",,"astro-ph",,"  We examine the thermal and dynamical response of a neutron star to a sudden
perturbation of the inner crust temperature. During the star's evolution,
starquakes and other processes may deposit $\gap 10^{42}$ ergs, causing
significant internal heating and increased frictional coupling between the
crust and the more rapidly rotating neutron superfluid the star is expected to
contain. Through numerical simulation we study the propagation of the thermal
wave created by the energy deposition, the induced motion of the interior
superfluid, and the resulting spin evolution of the crust. We find that energy
depositions of $\sim 10^{40}$ ergs produce gradual spin-ups above the timing
noise level, while larger energy depositions produce sudden spin jumps
resembling pulsar glitches. For a star with a temperature in the observed range
of the Vela pulsar, an energy deposition of $\sim 10^{42}$ ergs produces a
large spin-up taking place over minutes, similar to the Vela ``Christmas''
glitch. Comparable energy deposition in a younger and hotter ``Crab-like'' star
produces a smaller spin-up taking place over $\sim 1$ day, similar to that seen
during the partially time-resolved Crab glitch of 1989.

in the past. We observe that for a given angular momentum of the flow, the
shock wave undergoes a steady, radial oscillation with the period is roughly
equal to the cooling time. Oscillations seem to take place when the disk and
cooling parameters (i.e., accretion rate, cooling process) are such that the
infall time from shock is of the same order as the post-shock cooling time. The
amplitude of oscillation could be up to ten percent of the distance of the
shock wave from the black hole when the black hole is accreting. When the
accretion is impossible due to the centrifugal barrier, the amplitude variation
could be much larger. Due to the oscillation, the energy output from the disk
is also seen to vary quasi-periodically. We believe that these oscillations
might be responsible for the quasi periodic oscillation (QPO) behaviors seen in
several black hole candidates, in neutron star systems as well as dwarf novae
outbursts such as SS Cygni and VW Hyi.

states for a channel with any quantum numbers is presented. The problem of the
confining interaction for the Bethe-Salpeter equation is discussed from the
point of view of formal properties of the bound state spectrum, but with only
an inspiration from the QCD. We study the kernel that is non-vanishing at large
Euclidian intervals, $R_E\to \infty$, which is constructed as a special
limiting case of a sum of the covariant one-boson-exchange kernels. When the
usual attractive interaction is added, it is found that this kernel is similar
in its effect to the non-relativistic potential in coordinate space, $V(r)$,
with $V(r\to \infty) \to V_{\infty}$. The positive real constant $V_{\infty}$
gives the scale that define the limit of bound state spectrum compared to the
sum of the constituent masses, $M < 2m + V_{\infty}$. At the same time the
self-energy corrections remove the singularities from the propagators of the
constituents, i.e. constituents do not propagate as free particles. Combination
of these features of the solutions allows an interpretation of this type of
interaction as a confining one. The illustrative calculations are presented for
a model of massive scalar particles with scalar interaction, i.e. the ""massive
Wick model"".

greatly reduced when the next-to-leading- order corrections are taken into

is also considered. In the case of non-abelian gauge theories a careful
analysis of the constraints implied by the canonical transformation shows that
it does not relate Yang-Mills theories with inverted couplings. In fact the
dual theory is shown to be of Freedman- Townsend's type, also with ${\tilde
\tau}=-1/\tau$, $\tau=\frac{\theta}{2\pi}+\frac{4\pi i}{g^2}$.

potentials, for which a finite number of eigenstates are analytically known.
The three methods are respectively based on (i) a polynomial ansatz for wave
functions; (ii) point canonical transformations; (iii) supersymmetric quantum
mechanics. The methods are rather general and give considerably richer results
than those available in the current literature.

brackets in order to treat spatial integrals of divergences as Hamiltonians
which generate a kind of Hamiltonian equations on the boundary. Nonlinear
Schrodinger equation is used as an illustrative example.
