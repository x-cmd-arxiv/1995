pumping. The $\xb \to 0$ limit of the magnetic solution reproduces the linear
polarization derived in previous studies, which were always conducted at this
unphysical limit. While terms of higher order in \xb\ have a negligible effect
on the magnitude of $q$, they produce some major new results. In particular,
the linear polarization is accompanied by circular polarization, proportional
to \xb. Because \xb\ is proportional to the transition wavelength, the circular
polarization of SiO masers should decrease with rotation quantum number, as
observed. In the absence of theory for $\xb < 1$, previous estimates of
magnetic fields from detected maser circular polarization had to rely on
conjectures in this case and generally need to be revised downward. The fields
in SiO masers are \about\ 2--10 G and were overestimated by a factor of 8. The
OH maser regions around supergiants have fields of \about\ 0.1--0.5 mG, which

for OH/IR masers ($\la$ 0.1 mG) and \H2O masers in star-forming regions

their removal in all previous studies are never reproduced here; in particular,
there are no stationary physical solutions for propagation at $\sin^2\theta <

explanation of this observed difference in the luminosity distribution is that
the Galactic bulge is a triaxial structure, or a bar, which is inclined to the

galactic longitude is closer to us. Work is now under way to model the Galactic

coadjoint orbits and prove the integrability of hamiltonian (Generalized

algebra centrally extended by Kac-Moody, Virasoro and semidirect product
cocycles with arbitrary coefficients.
