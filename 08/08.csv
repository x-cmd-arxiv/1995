use it to make predictions about the distribution of extinctions and species
lifetimes that we would expect to see in real ecosystems. It should be possible
to test these predictions against the fossil record. The model indicates that a
possible mechanism for mass extinction is the coincidence of a large
coevolutionary avalanche in the ecosystem with a severe environmental
disturbance.

previrialization effect. We also use weakly nonlinear perturbative approach to
study the phenomenon. These two approaches agree when the rms density contrast,
$\sigma$, is small; more surprisingly, they remain in agreement when $\sigma
\approx 1$. When the slope of the initial power spectrum is $n>-1$, nonlinear
tidal interactions slow down the growth of density fluctuations and the
magnitude of the suppression increases when $n$ (i.e. the relative amount of
small scale power) is increased. For $n<-1$ we see an opposite effect: the
fluctuations grow more rapidly than in linear theory. The transition occurs at
$n=-1$ when the weakly nonlinear correction to $\sigma$ is close to zero and
the growth rate is close to linear. Our results resolve recent controversy
between two N-body studies of previrialization. Peebles (1990) assumed $n=0$
and found strong evidence in support of previrialization, while Evrard \& Crone
(1992), who assumed $n=-1$, reached opposite conclusions. As we show here, the
initial conditions with $n=-1$ are rather special because the nonlinear effects
nearly cancel out for that particular spectrum. In addition to our calculations
for scale-free initial spectra, we show results for a more realistic spectrum
of Peacock \& Dodds (1994). Its slope near the scale usually adopted for
normalization is close to $-1$, so $\sigma$ is close to linear. Our results
retroactively justify linear normalization at 8$h^{-1}$ Mpc, while also
demonstrating the danger and limitations of this practice.

colliding or evaporating bodies spread in a small belt. The gradient of the
distribution of dust expelled by radiation pressure is generally steeper than
the one observed around \bp. It follows that, to generate the \bp\ disk
distribution in such a way, one should extract relatively more small particles
in the production process: thanks to radiation forces, these smaller particles
have large eccentricities and thus could be seen at very large distances from
their injection place. The evaporation process of comet-like bodies moving
slowly inwards may yield the necessary particle size distribution.
  It is interesting to note that this dynamical description is able to account
for the main observational properties of the \bp\ disk, such as the power law
distribution with possibly a change in slope, the asymmetry at large distances,
and the total mass, all of which have remained unexplained up to now. If
confirmed, this scenario may indicate that the \bp\ disk could be looked on as
a gigantic multi-cometary tail with its natural constituents: gas and dust.

  figures (441951 bytes). Accepted for publication in September ApJ",,"10.1086/176201",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent investigations of how the median size of extragalactic radio sources
change with redshift have produced inconsistent results. Eales compared the
radio and optical properties of a bright 3C and faint 6C sample and concluded
that $D\propto(1+z)^{-1.1\pm0.5}$ ($\Omega_0 = 0$), with $D$ being the median
size of the radio sources at a given epoch and z the redshift. Oort, Katgert,
and Windhorst, on the other hand, from a comparison of the properties of a
number of radio samples, found much stronger evolution, with
$D\propto(1+z)^{-3.3 \pm0.5}$. In this paper we attempt to resolve the
difference. We have repeated the analysis of Eales using the virtually complete
redshift information that now exists for the 6C sample. Confining our analysis
to FR2 sources, which we argue is the best-understood class of radio sources
and the least likely to be affected by selection effects, we find
$D\propto(1+z)^{-1.2\pm0.5}$ ($\Omega_0 = 0$) and $D\propto(1+z)^{-1.7\pm0.4}$
($\Omega_0 = 1$). Our complete redshift information allows us to gain insight
into our result by plotting a radio luminosity-size (P-D) diagram for the 6C
sample. The most obvious difference between the 3C and 6C P-D diagrams is the
clump of sources in the 6C diagram at $D\sim 100 kpc, P_{151}\sim 5x10^{27}
WHz^{-1}sr^{-1}$. These clump sources have similar sizes to the emission-line
regions found around high-redshift radio galaxies, suggesting that the presence
of dense line-emitting gas around high-redshift radio galaxies is responsible
for the size evolution. We show that this explanation can quantitatively
explain the observed size evolution, as long as there is either little X-ray
emitting gas around these objects or, if there is, it is distributed in a
similar way to the emission-line gas: highly anisotropic and inhomogeneous.

relation which we call $K^+$, and in terms of it we formulate extended
definitions of concepts like causal curve and global hyperbolicity. In
particular we prove that, in a spacetime $\M$ which is free of causal cycles,
one may define a causal curve simply as a compact connected subset of $\M$
which is linearly ordered by $K^+$. Our definitions all make sense for
arbitrary $C^0$ metrics (and even for certain metrics which fail to be
invertible in places). Using this feature, we prove for a general $C^0$ metric,
the familiar theorem that the space of causal curves between any two compact
subsets of a globally hyperbolic spacetime is compact. We feel that our
approach, in addition to yielding a more general theorem, simplifies and
clarifies the reasoning involved. Our results have application in a recent
positive energy theorem, and may also prove useful in the study of topology
change. We have tried to make our treatment self-contained by including proofs

Computing the string tension and some glueball masses along the thermal phase
transition line of finite temperature systems with $N_t=4$, which was found to
join onto the bulk transition line at its endpoint, we find that the ratio
$\sqrt{\sigma} / T_c$ remains approximately constant. However, the mass of the
$0^{++}$ glueball decreases as the endpoint of the bulk transition line is
approached, while the other glueball masses appear unchanged. This is
consistent with the notion that the bulk transition line ends in a critical
endpoint, with the continuum limit there being a $\phi^4$ theory with a
diverging correlation length only in the $0^{++}$ channel. We comment on the
implications for the scaling behavior along the fundamental or Wilson axis.

difficulties of the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model in dealing with the
doublet-triplet splitting problem, the prediction of $\alpha_3(M_Z)$, and the
proton lifetime. We revamp the original MDM by extending its observable sector
to include fields and interactions that naturally suppress the dimension-five
proton decay operators and that allow see-saw neutrino masses. We also endow
the model with a hidden sector which (via gaugino condensation) triggers
supersymmetry breaking of the desired magnitude, and (via hidden matter
condensation) yields a new dynamical intermediate scale for the right-handed
neutrino masses ($\sim10^{10}\GeV$), and provides an effective Higgs mixing
parameter $\mu$. The model is consistent with gauge coupling unification for
experimentally acceptable values of $\alpha_3(M_Z)$, and with proton decay
limits even for large values of $\tan\beta$. The right-handed neutrinos can be
produced subsequent to inflation, and their out-of-equilibrium decays induce a
lepton asymmetry which is later reprocessed (via sphaleron interactions) into a
baryon asymmetry at the electroweak scale. The resulting see-saw neutrino
masses provide a candidate for the hot dark matter component of the Universe
($m_{\nu_\tau}\sim{\cal O}(10\eV)$) and are consistent with the MSW solution to
the solar neutrino problem. We finally compare the features of this traditional
GUT model with that of the readily string-derivable $SU(5)\times U(1)$ model,

contribute to SUSY breaking (instead of an overall modulus $T$). Some
qualitative features indeed change in the multimoduli case.A general discussion
for symmetric Abelian orbifolds as well as explicit examples are given. Certain
general sum-rules involving soft terms of different particles are shown to
apply to large classes of models. Unlike in the overall modulus $T$ case,
gauginos may be lighter than scalars even at the tree-level. However, if one
insists in getting that pattern of soft terms, these sum rules force some of
the scalars to get negative mass$^2$. These tachyonic masses could be a problem
for standard model 4-D strings but an advantage in the case of string-GUTs.We
also discuss the possible effects of off-diagonal metrics for the matter fields

the bilinear $B$ soft term are studied. It is found that the Giudice-Masiero
mechanism for generating a ``$\mu $-term'', as naturally implemented in
orbifolds, leads to the prediction $|tg\beta |=1$ at the string scale,

the simulation of standard Turing machines by reversible ones. So far only
upper bounds for the tradeoff based on the pebble game have been published.
Here we give a recursion for the time optimal solution of the pebble game given
a space bound. We analyze the recursion to obtain an explicit asymptotic
expression for the best time-space product.

  application to cubic semiconductors",,,,,"mtrl-th chem-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  We present a general scheme for the computation of the time dependent (TD)
quadratic susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$) of an extended insulator obtained by
applying the `$2n+1$' theorem to the action functional as defined in TD density
functional theory. The resulting expression for $\chi^{(2)}$ includes
self-consistent local-field effects, and is a simple function of the linear
response of the system. We compute the static $\chi^{(2)}$ of nine III-V and
five II-VI semiconductors using the local density approximation(LDA) obtaining
good agreement with experiment. For GaP we also evaluate the TD $\chi^{(2)}$
for second harmonic generation using TD-LDA.

even-even nuclei in the isospin-invariant forms of the IBM, IBM-3 and IBM-4, in
the cases where the respective natural internal symmetries, isospin $U$(3) and
$U(6)\supset SU$(4), are conserved. Subsequently, the total strength is
resolved into its component partial sums to the allowed isospins (and $SU(4)$
representations in IBM-4). In cases where the usual IBM dynamical symmetries
are also valid, a complete description of all $B(M1,0^+_1\rightarrow1^+_i)$ is
given. In contrast to IBM-2, there is fragmentation of the strength even in the
dynamical symmetry cases, for $T\neq 0$, over two states in IBM-3, and over
three states in IBM-4. The presence of $pn$ bosons in the ground state of the
extended versions reduces the expected strength from that for IBM-2, allowing
in principle the possibility of using $B(M1)$ data for a given nucleus to infer
which version is the most appropriate.

symmetry-projected quasiparticle excitations with respect to it. The underlying
HFB transformation, which is assumed to be time-reversal and axially symmetric,
is determined by variation after the projection. The model allows the use of
large basis systems. It has been applied to the calculation of energy spectra
of several even-even, odd-odd and odd mass nuclei in the sd shell with mass
numbers reaching from A=20 to 30. The Chung-Wildenthal interaction has been
used. Good agreement with the exact shell model diagonalization and a
considerable improvement on a previous approach, where the HFB transformation
was significantly more restricted, is obtained.

resonance. The $\Delta$ resonance is treated as a Rarita-Schwinger field with
phenomenological $N \Delta$ transition currents. The background contributions
are given by the usual Born terms using the pseudovector $\pi N$ Lagrangian.
Numerical results for the asymmetry are presented.
