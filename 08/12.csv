quasars is thought to be produced by energetic electrons confined in plasma
blobs which are ejected from supermassive black holes at relativistic speeds.
The lower energy radio-through-optical component is almost certainly nonthermal
electron synchrotron radiation, while the higher-energy $\gamma$-ray component
is probably due to Compton scattering of target photons by these same
electrons. If the high-energy component is formed by jet electrons
Compton-scattering radiation from outside the jet, such as the direct or
rescattered accretion-disk photons, then the ratio of the power in the
high-energy Compton component to the power in the low-energy synchrotron
component stands in a simple relation depending on the observing angle to the
jet and the plasma outflow speed. When combined with contemporaneous VLBI
measurements of apparent transverse speed, we find that a simple diagram
relates different classes of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and makes
definite predictions for multiwavelength observations of these sources. If an
equipartition parameter remains constant between episodes of plasma ejection,
then multiple observations of a single source can in principle determine the
Hubble constant.

We explore a possible identification with aromatic hydrocarbons at low
temperatures, which absorb at a similar wavelength. If the feature is due to
aromatics, the derived column density of C--H bonds is $\sim$1.8 $\times$
$10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. If the absorbing aromatic molecules are of roughly the
same size as those responsible for aromatic emission features in the
interstellar medium, then we estimate that $\sim$9\% of the cosmic abundance of
carbon along this line of sight would be in aromatic hydrocarbons, in agreement
with abundance estimates from emission features.

such reductions. It has been argued that the discrepancy between the predicted

accidental cancellation between tree-level amplitudes, and is not a fundamental
problem for chiral perturbation theory. Agreement between experimentally
determined NNK P-wave amplitudes and our estimates would support this

involve new flavor mixing matrices. The assumptions involved in the
construction of minimal supersymmetric models, both $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times

matrices. However, the requirement of realistic quark and lepton masses in
supersymmetric grand unified theories forces these matrices to be non-trivial.
This leads to important new dominant contributions to the neutron electric
dipole moment and to the decay mode $p \to K^o\mu^+$, and suggests that there
may be important weak scale radiative corrections to the Yukawa coupling matrix
of the up quarks. The lepton flavor violating signal $\mu \to e\gamma$ is
studied in these theories when $\tan\beta$ is sufficiently large that radiative
effects of couplings other than $\lambda_t$ must be included. The naive
expectation that large $\tan\beta$ will force sleptons to unacceptably large
masses is not borne out: radiative suppressions to the leptonic flavor mixing
angles allow regions where the sleptons are as light as 300 GeV, provided the
top Yukawa coupling in the unified theory is near the minimal value consistent
with $m_t$.

background geometry is given by the DS principal bundle $K$ associated to a

a hermitian fiber metric $H$ of $K$ and a $(0,1)$ Koszul gauge field $A^*$ of
$K$ valued in a certain negative graded subalgebra $\goth x$ of $\goth g$
related to $\goth s$. The action governing the $H$ and $A^*$ dynamics is the
effective action of a DS field theory in the geometric background specified by
$H$ and $A^*$. Quantization of $H$ and $A^*$ implements on one hand the DS
reduction and on the other defines a novel model of $2d$ gravity, DS gravity.
The gauge fixing of the DS gauge symmetry yields an integration on a moduli
space of DS gauge equivalence classes of $A^*$ configurations, the DS moduli
space. The model has a residual gauge symmetry associated to the DS gauge
transformations leaving a given field $A^*$ invariant. This is the DS
counterpart of conformal symmetry. Conformal invariance and certain non
perturbative features of the model are discussed in detail.
